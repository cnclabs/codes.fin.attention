our business and our strategy introduction our company was founded more than years ago by independent agents to support the ability of local independent property casualty insurance agents to deliver quality financial protection to people and businesses in their communities 
today  we operate much the same way  actively marketing standard market commercial insurance policies in states through a select group of independent insurance agencies 
we actively market all of our personal lines insurance policies in of those states and began in january to market excess and surplus lines policies in five states through the same agencies that offer our standard market property casualty insurance products 
we also seek to become the life insurance carrier of choice for the agencies that market our property casualty insurance products and offer other financial services to help agents and their clients  the policyholders 
our company distinguishes itself in three key ways we cultivate relationships with the independent insurance agents who market our policies and we make our decisions at the local level we achieve claims excellence  covering the spectrum from our response to reported claims to our approach to establishing reserves for not yet paid claims we invest for long term total return  using available cash flow to purchase equity securities after covering insurance liabilities by purchasing fixed maturity securities cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents cultivating relationships with independent insurance agents the us property casualty insurance industry is a highly competitive marketplace with over  stock and mutual companies operating independently or in groups 
no single company or group dominates across all product lines and states 
standard market insurance companies carriers can market a broad array of products nationally or choose to sell a limited product line or only one type of insurance monoline carrier target a certain segment of the market for example  personal insurance focus on one or more states or regions regional carrier in addition to the widely known standard market for property casualty insurance  the excess and surplus lines market exists due to a regulatory distinction 
generally  excess and surplus lines insurance carriers provide insurance that is unavailable to businesses in the standard market due to market conditions or due to characteristics of the insured that are caused by nature  the insured s history or the nature of their business 
insurers operating in the surplus lines market are generally small  specialty insurers or specialized divisions of larger insurance organizations 
each markets through surplus lines insurance brokers 
standard market property casualty insurers generally offer their products through one or more distribution channels independent agents  who represent multiple carriers  captive agents  who represent one carrier exclusively  or direct marketing through the mail or internet some carriers use more than one channel 
for the most part  we compete with standard market insurance companies that market through independent insurance agents 
independent agency distribution system we are committed to the independent agency distribution system  offering our broad array of insurance products through this channel 
we recognize that locally based independent agencies have relationships in their communities that can lead to policyholder satisfaction  loyalty and profitable business 
our field associates provide service and accountability to the agencies  living in the communities they serve and working from offices in their homes  providing availability to our agents 
at year end  our  agency relationships had  reporting agency locations marketing our standard market insurance products 
an increasing number of agencies have multiple  separately identifiable locations  reflecting their growth and consolidation of ownership within the independent agency marketplace 
reporting agency locations describes our agents scope of business and our presence within our active states 
at year end  our  agency relationships had  reporting agency locations marketing our insurance products 
at year end  we had  agency relationships with  reporting agency locations 
in addition to providing data on reporting agency locations  we continue to give agency relationships metrics  such as our penetration within each agency relationship 
cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents property casualty earned premiums by state in our highest volume states  reporting agency locations wrote percent of our total standard market property casualty earned premium volume compared with percent in reporting agency net earned percent of average premium dollars in millions locations premiums total earned per location year ended december  ohio illinois indiana pennsylvania north carolina georgia michigan virginia wisconsin tennessee year ended december  ohio illinois indiana pennsylvania michigan georgia north carolina virginia wisconsin kentucky in  the most recent period for which data is available  cincinnati insurance was the no 
or no 
carrier in approximately percent of the reporting agency locations that have represented us for more than five years 
the independent agencies that we choose to market our products share our philosophies 
they do business person to person  offer broad  value added services  maintain sound balance sheets and manage their agencies professionally 
on average  we have a percent share of the property casualty insurance in our reporting agency locations 
our share is percent in reporting agency locations that have represented us for more than years  percent in agencies that have represented us for five to years  percent in agencies that have represented us for one to five years  and percent in agencies that have represented us for less than one year 
over the next decade  industry analysts predict successful agencies will have opportunities to increase their size on average almost three fold 
agencies are expected to continue to pursue consolidation opportunities  buying or merging with other agencies to create stronger organizations and expand service 
in addition to the growing networks of agency locations owned by banks and brokers  other agencies are addressing the consolidation by forming voluntary associations 
these associations  or clusters  share back office and other functions to enhance economies  while maintaining their individual ownership structures 
our largest single agency relationship accounted for approximately percent of our total agency earned premiums in no aggregate of locations under a single ownership structure accounted for more than percent of our total agency earned premiums in strengthening our agency relationships we follow a number of strategies to strengthen our relationships with the independent property casualty insurance agencies that market our products 
emphasis on relationships and local decision making we continue to expand the services we provide that support agency opportunities 
accessible field representatives are the first layer of support 
headquarters associates also provide agencies with underwriting  accounting and technology assistance and training 
company executives  headquarters underwriters and special teams regularly travel to visit agencies 
agents have opportunities for direct  personal conversations with our senior management team  and headquarters associates have opportunities to refresh their knowledge of marketplace conditions and field activities 
the field marketing representatives are joined by field representatives specializing in claims  loss control  machinery and equipment  bond  premium audit  life insurance and leasing 
for example  our field machinery and equipment and loss control representatives perform inspections and recommend specific actions to improve the safety of the policyholder s operations and the quality of the agent s account 
agents tell us they agree with the need to carefully select risks and assure pricing adequacy 
they appreciate the time our associates invest in creating solutions for their clients while protecting profitability  whether that cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents means working on an individual case or developing modified policy terms and conditions that preserve flexibility  choice and other sales advantages 
risk specific underwriting we seek to be a consistent  predictable and reasonable property casualty carrier that agencies can rely on to serve their clients 
our field and headquarters underwriters make risk specific decisions about both new business and renewals 
on a case by case basis  we select risks we can cover on acceptable terms and at adequate prices rather than underwriting solely by geographic location or business class 
for new commercial lines business  this case by case underwriting and pricing is coordinated by the local field marketing representatives 
our agents and our field marketing  loss control  premium audit  bond and machinery and equipment representatives get to know the people and businesses in their communities and can make informed decisions about each risk 
these field marketing representatives also are responsible for selecting new independent agencies  coordinating field teams of specialized company representatives and promoting all of the company s products within the agencies they serve 
commercial lines policy renewals are managed by headquarters underwriters who are assigned to specific agencies and consult with local field staff  as needed 
we apply our risk specific underwriting philosophy to personal lines new and renewal business in a different process 
each agency selects personal lines business from within the geographic territory that it serves  based on the agent s knowledge of the risks in those communities or familiarity with the policyholder 
new and renewal business activities are supported by headquarters associates assigned to individual agencies 
competitive insurance products we are committed to offering the property casualty products and services local agents need to serve their clients the policyholders 
our products are structured to allow flexible combinations of property and liability coverages in a single package with a single expiration date 
this approach brings policyholders convenience  discounts and a reduced risk of coverage gaps or disputes 
at the same time  it increases account retention and saves time and expense for the agency and our company 
our commercial lines packages are typically offered on a three year policy term for most insurance coverages  a key competitive advantage 
although we offer three year policy terms  premiums for some coverages within those policies are adjustable at anniversary for the next annual period  and policies may be cancelled at any time at the discretion of the policyholder 
contract terms often provide that rates for property  general liability  inland marine and crime coverages  as well as policy terms and conditions  are fixed for the term of the policy 
the general liability exposure basis may be audited annually 
commercial auto  workers compensation  professional liability and most umbrella liability coverages within multi year packages are rated at each of the policy s annual anniversaries for the next one year period 
the annual pricing could incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance regulatory authorities between the date the policy was written and its annual anniversary date  as well as changes in risk exposures and premium credits or debits relating to loss experience  competition and other underwriting judgment factors 
we estimate that approximately percent of commercial premiums were subject to annual rating or were written on a one year policy term 
in our experience  multi year packages are somewhat less price sensitive for the quality conscious insurance buyers who we believe are typical clients of our independent agents 
customized insurance programs on a three year term complement the long term relationships these policyholders typically have with their agents and with the company 
by reducing annual administrative efforts  multi year policies lower expenses for our company and for our agents 
the commitment we make to policyholders encourages long term relationships and reduces their need to annually re evaluate their insurance carrier or agency 
we believe that the advantages of three year policies in terms of improved policyholder convenience  increased account retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential disadvantage of these policies  even in periods of rising rates 
our personal lines policies are offered on a one year term  except homeowner policies in three states that represent less than one percent of total personal lines premium volume 
competitive advantages of our personal lines coverages include our credit structure and customizable endorsements for both the personal auto and homeowner policies 
a newly introduced personal auto policy endorsement is replacement cost coverage for newly purchased vehicles 
popular homeowner endorsements include replacement cost for contents  inflation guard  identity theft expense coverage and advocacy services  flexible water damage coverages and enhanced replacement cost coverage for older homes 
technology solutions we seek to employ technology solutions and business process improvements that complement our core values of local underwriting decisions  strong relationships with our independent agencies and superior claims service 
in recent years  we have made significant investments in state of the art information technology platforms  systems and internet based applications to allow our agencies and our field and headquarters associates to collaborate more efficiently  cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents provide our agencies the ability to access our systems and client data to process business transactions from their offices  automate our internal processes so our associates can spend more time serving agents and policyholders  and reduce duplication and make our processes more efficient to reduce company and agency costs 
agencies access our systems and other electronic services via cincilink  our secure agency only portal 
cincilink provides an array of web based services and content that make it easier to do business with us  such as commercial and personal lines rating and processing systems  policy loss information  sales and marketing materials  educational courses on our products and services  and electronic libraries for property and casualty coverage forms and state rating manuals 
commercial lines technology wincpp is our commercial lines premium quoting system 
wincpp is available in all of our agency locations in of the states in which we actively market insurance and provides quoting capabilities for nearly percent of our new and renewal commercial lines business 
in  we plan to introduce wincpp in our newest states washington and new mexico 
wincpp provides a real time agency interface  cincibridge  which allows automated movement of key underwriting data from an agent s management system to wincpp  reducing agents data entry and allowing seamless quoting and rating capabilities 
many small business accounts written as businessowners policies bop and dentist s package policies dbop are eligible to be issued at our agency locations through our web based e clas policy processing system 
a businessowners policy combines property  liability and business interruption coverages for small businesses 
e clas provides full policy lifecycle transactions including quoting  issuance  policy changes  renewal processing and policy printing at the agency location 
these features make it easier and more efficient for our agencies to issue and service these policies 
at year end  e clas was in use in states representing percent of our bop and dbop premiums  which are included in the specialty packages commercial line of business 
we continue to roll out e clas to additional states for these policy types  including two new states since the beginning of e clas also utilizes cincibridge to provide real time agency interface 
our primary long term technology objective is to complete development of e clas for all of our commercial lines of business 
to respond to agency needs  a direct bill payment option is being made available for commercial lines policyholders 
our first step is to make the direct bill option available for policies issued through e clas 
we rolled out this capability to selected agencies in with full agency rollout in early similar direct billing capability for selected commercial policies not issued through e clas is anticipated by the end of with the intent to offer this capability for all policies as soon as practicable 
since  we have been streamlining internal processes and achieving operational efficiencies in our headquarters commercial lines operations through deployment of iview  a policy imaging and workflow system 
this system provides online access to electronic copies of policy files  enabling our underwriters to respond to agent requests and inquiries more quickly and efficiently 
iview also automates internal workflows through electronic routing of underwriting and processing work tasks 
at year end  more than percent of in force non workers compensation commercial lines policy files were administered and stored electronically in iview 
e s technology cincinnati specialty underwriters and csu producer resources employ a web based policy administration system to quote  bind  issue and deliver policies electronically to agents 
this system also provides integration to existing document management and data management systems  allowing for straight through processing of policies and billing 
personal lines technology diamond is a real time personal lines policy processing system  supporting all six of our personal lines of business and allowing once and done processing 
diamond incorporates features frequently requested by our agencies such as direct bill and monthly payment plans  local and headquarters policy printing options  data transfer to and from popular agency management systems and real time integration with data from third party sources needed to calculate final premiums such as insurance scores  mvr reports and address verification 
at year end  diamond was in use in states representing approximately percent of our personal lines premium volume 
in  we expect to deploy diamond to agencies in eight additional states 
although we already market personal lines products in maryland  montana  new hampshire  north carolina and vermont  we expect agencies in these states to respond favorably to diamond s advantages 
we also expect to deploy diamond to agencies in arizona  south carolina and utah  new markets for our personal lines products 
in  we introduced pl efiles  a policy imaging system  to our personal lines operations 
through year end  we had transitioned information on current diamond personal lines policies to pl efiles and continue to work on imaging older policy information 
the transition replaces paper format with electronic copies of policy documents 
pl efiles complements the diamond system by giving personal lines underwriters and support staff cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents online access to policy documents and data that enable them to respond to agent requests and inquiries quickly and efficiently 
claims technology our property and casualty claims operation has streamlined processes and achieved operational efficiencies through the use of cms  our claims file management system 
initially deployed in late  cms allows field and headquarters claims associates to process all reported claims in a virtual claim file 
we continue to refine the system to add capabilities to make our associates more effective 
during  we issued tablet computers to our field claims representatives 
these units allow our claims representatives to view and enter information into cms from any location  including an insured s home or agent s office  and to print claim checks using portable printers 
agency access to selected cms information was tested in the fourth quarter of  with the full rollout due to be completed in early life insurance offerings strengthen agency relationships we support the independent agencies affiliated with our property casualty operations in their programs to sell life insurance 
the products offered by our life insurance subsidiary round out and protect accounts and improve account persistency 
at the same time  the life operation looks to increase diversification of revenue and profitability sources for both the agency and our company 
our property casualty agencies make up the main distribution system for our life insurance products 
we also develop life business from other independent life insurance agencies to provide us with penetration in geographic markets not served through our property casualty agencies 
we are careful to solicit business from these other agencies in a manner that does not conflict with or compete with the marketing and sales efforts of our property casualty agencies 
we emphasize up to date products  responsive underwriting  high quality service and competitive pricing 
excess and surplus lines operation further enhances agency relationships in january  we began accepting excess and surplus lines business from cincinnati s independent agencies in georgia  illinois  indiana  ohio and wisconsin 
these agencies have access to the cincinnati specialty underwriters insurance company s product line through csu producer resources  the new  wholly owned insurance brokerage subsidiary of parent company cincinnati financial corporation 
csu producer resources has binding authority on all classes of business written through csu and maintains appropriate agent and surplus lines licenses to process non admitted business 
csu and csu producer resources plan to expand into all states except delaware on an excess and surplus lines basis as the new companies obtain the necessary state regulatory approvals 
we structured our new e s operations to exclusively serve the needs of the independent agencies that currently market our standard market insurance policies 
when all or a portion of a current or potential client s insurance program requires e s coverages  those agencies now can write the whole account with cincinnati  gaining benefits not often found in the broader e s market 
producers can submit risks to csu producer resources from a variety of classes  reflecting the mix of accounts cincinnati agencies currently write in their non admitted e s markets 
csu producer resources currently markets and underwrites general liability coverages and plans to expand this to include commercial property  multi peril insurance  miscellaneous professional liability and excess casualty in coming months 
agency producers have direct access through csu producer resources to our dedicated e s underwriters  and they also can tap into their agencies broader cincinnati relationships to bring their policyholders services such as experienced and responsive loss control and claims handling 
our new e s policy administration system delivers electronic copies of policies to producers within minutes of underwriting approval and policy issue 
csu producer resources gives extra support to our producers by remitting surplus lines taxes and stamping fees and retaining admitted market affadavits  where required 
csu was capitalized with million from its parent company  the cincinnati insurance company 
that high level of funding underscores our commitment to help our independent agencies 
everything we do to increase their competitive advantages and success also helps us achieve our own long term growth and profitability goals 
programs  products and services to support agency growth we complement the insurance operations by providing products and services that help attract and retain high quality independent insurance agencies 
when we appoint agencies  we look for organizations with knowledgeable  professional staffs 
in turn  we make an exceptionally strong commitment to assist them in keeping their knowledge up to date and educating new people they bring on board as they grow 
numerous activities at our headquarters  in regional and agency locations  and online fulfill this commitment at our headquarters  we conduct agency management roundtables for agency principals  as well as our regular schedule of commercial lines  personal lines and life insurance agent schools and seminars 
these generally focus on cincinnati product and underwriting information and sales tips 
in addition to schools for agents  we make available seats for agents in our structured classroom training for new underwriting cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents associates 
agency staff may return to their agencies after the class or stay and become fully grounded in cincinnati philosophy by serving as an associate for a few years before returning to the agency 
associates travel to regional and agency locations to instruct classes and provide a variety of educational support services 
teams conduct seminars on a variety of topics  such as marketing seminars to promote cross marketing of our products

our new producer and customer service representative curricula guide students through a progression of online courses and classroom instruction 
except travel related expenses for courses held at our headquarters  most programs are offered at no cost to our agencies 
while that approach may be extraordinary in our industry today  the result is quality service for our policyholders and increased success for our independent agencies 
in addition to broad education and training support  we make financial services available through our non insurance subsidiaries 
we believe that providing these services enhances agency relationships with their clients  increasing loyalty while diversifying the agency s revenues

superior financial strength ratings in addition to the ratings of our parent company senior debt  independent ratings firms award our property casualty and life operations insurer financial strength ratings based on their quantitative and qualitative analyses 
these ratings assess an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and do not necessarily address all of the matters that may be important to shareholders 
we believe that our strong surplus position and superior insurer financial strength ratings are clear  competitive advantages in the segment of the insurance marketplace that our agents serve 
our financial strength supports the consistent  predictable performance that our policyholders  agents  associates and shareholders have always expected and received  and it must be able to withstand significant challenges 
we seek to ensure that our performance remains consistent and predictable by aligning agents interests with those of the company  giving them outstanding service and compensation and earning their best business by enhancing their ability to serve the businesses and individuals in their communities

the ratings outlook is stable

the outlook is stable 
standard poor s ratings services on july   standard poor s ratings services affirmed the aa very strong financial strength ratings and counterparty credit ratings for our standard market property casualty and life insurance companies 
standard poor s cited our very strong distribution channel and low cost infrastructure  extremely strong capitalization  high degree of financial flexibility and improved operating performance 
offsetting these strengths are a very aggressive investment strategy  underperformance in the homeowner line of business and a relatively high catastrophe exposure 
the outlook is stable 
statutory surplus for our property casualty insurance group was billion at year end  with the ratio of the group s investments in common stock to statutory surplus at percent  in line with our targeted sub percent level 
statutory surplus for our property casualty insurance subsidiary was billion at year end  with the ratio of the group s investments in common stock to statutory surplus to statutory surplus at percent 
the life insurance company s statutory surplus was million at year end  with the ratio of life insurance company s investments in common stock to statutory adjusted capital and surplus at percent 
life statutory surplus was million at year end  with the ratio at percent 
cincinnati life s statutory adjusted risk based surplus decreased percent to million at year end  from million a year earlier 
statutory adjusted risk based surplus as a percentage of liabilities  a key measure of life insurance company capital strength  was percent at year end compared with an estimated industry average ratio of percent 
a higher ratio indicates an insurer s stronger security for policyholders and capacity to support business growth 
at year end and  the risk based capital rbc for our property casualty and life operations was exceptionally strong and well above levels that would have required regulatory action 
we continue to review the risk management and capital requirement changes that rating agencies have suggested for our industry 
additionally  we began a formal implementation of enterprise risk management in responsibility for enterprise risk management has been assigned at the officer level  supported by a team of representatives from business areas 
the team reports to our president  our chief executive officer and our board of directors  as appropriate  on detailed and summary risk assessments  risk metrics and risk plans 
our use of operational audits  strategic plans and departmental business plans  as well as our culture of open communications and our fundamental respect for our code of conduct  continue to help us manage risks on an ongoing basis 
while the potential for volatility exists due to our catastrophe exposures  investment philosophy and bias toward incremental change  the ratings agencies consistently have asserted that we have built appropriate financial strength and flexibility to manage that volatility 
we remain committed to strategies that emphasize long term stability over short term benefits that might accrue by quick reaction to changes in market conditions 
for example  through all market and economic cycles we maintain strong insurance company statutory surplus  a solid  conservative reinsurance program  sound reserving practices and low interest rate risk  as well as low debt and strong capital at the parent company level 
investments at the parent company give us flexibility to support our capitalization policies for the subsidiaries  improve the ability of the insurance companies to write additional premiums and maintain high insurer financial strength ratings for the protection of policyholders 
we believe that our property catastrophe reinsurance program provides adequate protection for large loss events 
our strong capital position would allow the payment of claims if an event exceeded our reinsurance program 
currently participating on our property per risk and casualty per occurrence programs are hannover reinsurance company  munich reinsurance america  partner reinsurance company of the us and swiss reinsurance america corporation and its subsidiaries  all of which have am best insurer financial strength ratings of a excellent or a superior 
over the past several years  we also modified policyholder deductibles cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents for both commercial and personal lines property coverages to reduce our exposure to a single significant catastrophic event 
our ratio of property casualty net written premiums to statutory surplus was at year end  and this ratio is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty industry 
it serves as an indicator of the company s premium growth capacity 
the estimated property casualty industry net written premium to statutory surplus ratio was at year end  at year end and at year end growing with our agencies one of our primary objectives is to increase our written premiums more rapidly than the industry 
we believe our agencies are growing more rapidly than the industry  and we seek to maintain or increase our share of each agency s business as it grows 
to help us maintain or increase our share within each agency  we are further improving service through the creation of smaller marketing territories that permit our local field marketing representatives to devote more time to each agency relationship 
at year end  we had field marketing territories  up from at the end of and at the end of in  we also appointed our first agencies in eastern washington and new mexico  our rd and th states of operation 
while we continually study the regulatory and competitive environment in states where we could decide to actively market our property casualty products  we have not announced plans to enter any of those states in the near future 
another way we seek to increase overall premiums is to expand our agency plant within our current marketing territories 
our objective is to appoint additional sales offices  or points of distribution  each year 
we are targeting appointments in in measuring progress towards this goal  we include appointment of new agency relationships with cincinnati the primary focus of our goal 
for those that we believe will produce a meaningful amount of new business premiums  we also include appointment of agencies that merge with a cincinnati agency and new branch offices opened by existing cincinnati agencies 
we made  and new appointments in  and  respectively 
of these new appointments   and  respectively  were new relationships 
these new appointments and other changes in agency structures led to a net increase in reporting agency locations of in  in and in we are very careful to protect the franchise for current agencies when selecting and appointing new agencies 
achieving claims excellence our claims philosophy reflects our belief that we will prosper as a company by responding to claims person to person  paying covered claims promptly  preventing false claims from unfairly adding to overall premiums and building financial strength to meet future obligations 
we also believe that our company should have the financial strength to pay claims while also creating value for shareholders  leading to our emphasis on the establishment of adequate loss reserves 
superior claims service our locally based field claims representatives work from their homes  assigned to specific agencies 
they respond personally to policyholders and claimants  typically within hours of receiving an agency s claim report 
we believe we have a competitive advantage because of the person to person approach and the resulting high level of service that our field claims representatives provide 
we also help our agencies provide prompt service to policyholders by giving agencies authority to immediately pay most first party claims under standard market policies up to  catastrophe response teams are comprised of volunteers from our experienced field claims staff 
as hurricanes threaten  these associates travel to strategic locations near the expected impact area 
this puts them in position to quickly get to the affected area  set up temporary offices and start calling on policyholders 
cincinnati takes pride in giving our field personnel the tools and authority they need to do their jobs 
in times of widespread loss  our field claims representatives confidently and quickly resolve claims  often writing checks for damages on the same day they inspect the loss 
cms introduced new efficiencies that are especially evident during catastrophes 
electronic claim files allow for fast initial contact of policyholders and easy sharing of information between rotating storm teams  headquarters and local field claims representatives 
cincinnati s claims associates work hard to control costs where appropriate 
they have vendor resources that provide negotiated pricing to our insureds and claimants and that help us determine appropriate pricing for medical cost related claims 
our field claims representatives also are educated continuously on new techniques and repair trends 
they can leverage their local knowledge and experience with area body shops  which helps them negotiate the right price with any facility the policyholder chooses 
we staff a special investigations unit with former law enforcement and claims professionals who are available to gather facts to uncover potential fraud 
while we believe it s our job to pay what is due under each policy  we also want to prevent false claims from unfairly increasing overall premiums 
our siu also operates a computer cincinnati financial corporation annual report on k page 
table of contents forensic lab  using sophisticated software to recover data and mitigating the cost of computer related claims for business interruption and loss of records 
loss and loss expense reserves when claims are made by or against policyholders  any amounts that our property casualty operations pay or expect to pay for covered claims are termed losses 
the costs we incur in investigating  resolving and processing these claims are termed loss expenses 
our consolidated financial statements include property casualty loss and loss expense reserves that estimate the costs of not yet paid claims incurred through december of each year 
the reserves include estimates for claims that have been reported to us plus our estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported called ibnr  along with our estimate for loss expenses associated with processing and settling those claims
