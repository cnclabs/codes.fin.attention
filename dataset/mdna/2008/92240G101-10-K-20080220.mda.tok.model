item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in this discussion and analysis  the company analyzes contributions to consolidated earnings from its utility group and nonutility group separately since each operate independently requiring distinct competencies and business strategies  offers different energy and energy related products and services  and experiences different opportunities and risks 
nonutility group operations are discussed below as primary operations  other operations  and synfuel related results 
primary nonutility operations denote areas of management s forward looking focus 
tax laws authorizing tax credits for the production of certain synthetic fuels expired on december   and should not have a material impact on future results 
per share earnings contributions of the utility group  nonutility group  and corporate and other are presented 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to the groups  but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation s assets and liabilities as a whole 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the activities of and revenues and cash flows generated by the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in addition  there are other operations  referred to herein as corporate and other  that include unallocated corporate expenses such as advertising and charitable contributions  among other activities 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 

table of contents the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary of consolidated results of operations year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other results for the year ended december   reported earnings were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in  and million  or per share  in the increase in earnings compared to is primarily attributable to higher gas and electric utility margins and increased earnings from the sale of wholesale power 
results also reflect increased earnings from the company s nonutility operations  primarily energy infrastructure services  and increased synfuel related results 
the decline in results compared to is primarily attributable to a decline in synfuel related results  a charge related to the settlement of a lawsuit involving proliance holdings  llc proliance  and lower wholesale power marketing margins 
utility group in  the utility group s earnings were million compared to million in the increase resulted from base rate increases in the vectren south service territory  the combined impact of residential and commercial usage and lost margin recovery  favorable weather  and increased wholesale power marketing margins 
the increase was offset somewhat by increased operating costs including depreciation expense and a lower effective tax rate in in compared to  the decline in utility group earnings is primarily the result of lower wholesale power marketing margins as well as declines in customer usage  higher depreciation and interest costs 
the decline was mitigated somewhat by the implementation of regulatory initiatives noted above  the impact of a lower effective tax rate  and a gain realized on the sale of a storage asset 
in the company s electric and ohio natural gas service territories which are not protected by weather normalization mechanisms  management estimates the margin impact of weather experienced to be million favorable compared to year normal temperatures  or on a per share basis 
in and weather across all utilities was unfavorable compared to year normal temperatures 
management estimates the effect of weather compared to normal was unfavorable per share in and unfavorable per share in the and weather effect is net of normal temperature adjustment nta mechanism impacts 
the nta was implemented in the company s indiana natural gas service territories in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents nonutility group the nonutility group s earnings were million compared to million in and million in the company s primary nonutility operations contributed earnings of million in compared to million in and million in primary nonutility operations are energy marketing and services companies  coal mining operations  and energy infrastructure services companies 
primary nonutility group results increased million  or per share 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher miller pipeline miller earnings and the unfavorable impact of the proliance litigation settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of the increased contribution from miller of million is due largely to more large gas construction projects  pricing increases  and vectren s percent ownership of miller in earnings from energy systems group and retail gas marketing operations were also favorable year over year 
operating earnings from proliance were down year over year by million as the favorable impact of their increased storage capacity was more than offset by lower volatility in the wholesale natural gas markets 
coal mining earnings were million in compared to million in primarily due to compliance with new mine safety and health administration msha seal and safety guidelines and the associated lost production and higher sulfur content from coal mined under the revised mining plan 
primary nonutility business earnings decreased million in compared to earnings from proliance decreased million year over year due largely to the million legal settlement 
in addition  proliance achieved record earnings in due to larger spreads between financial and physical markets  which resulted from market disruptions caused by gulf coast hurricanes 
energy infrastructure services companies  which include energy systems group and miller pipeline contributed additional earnings of million and million respectively and offset lower earnings from vectren source and coal mining operations 
results from other nonutility businesses  which were earnings of million in  losses of million in  and income of million in  were primarily impacted by the company s broadband investments and its investment in haddington energy partners 
in  the company sold its investment in sigecom  llc at a loss of approximately million after tax 
in  haddington s results include a million after tax gain on the sale of an investment 
in  the last year of synfuel operations  synfuel related results generated earnings of million 
of those earnings  which do not continue in and beyond  million million on a pre tax basis was contributed to the vectren foundation 
net of that contribution  synfuel related results were million  or per share  in  compared to a loss of million  or per share  in and earnings of million or per share in in  synfuel related activity includes a million after tax impairment charge related to the company s investment in pace carbon synfuels lp 
the foundation contribution is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
other operations corporate and other reported a loss of per share in due principally to a million  or million after tax  contribution to the vectren foundation  which is also recorded in other operating expenses 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december  were per share compared to in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
the increase marks the th consecutive year vectren and predecessor companies have increased annual dividends paid 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these operations are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of utility holdings operations 
the operations of the utility group consist of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
the company segregates its regulated operations into a gas utility services operating segment and an electric utility services operating segment 
the gas utility services segment includes the operations of indiana gas  the ohio operations  and sigeco s natural gas distribution business and provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio 
the electric utility services segment includes the operations of sigeco s electric transmission and distribution services  which provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and the company s power generating and asset optimization operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
utility operating results before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income contribution to vectren basic eps significant fluctuations utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power 
these measures exclude other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes  which are included in the calculation of operating income 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are seasonal and are impacted by weather 
trends in average use among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline in recent years as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed and the price of natural gas has increased 
normal temperature adjustment nta and lost margin recovery mechanisms largely mitigate the effect on gas utility margin that would otherwise 
table of contents be caused by variations in volumes sold due to weather and changing consumption patterns 
indiana gas territory has both an nta since and lost margin recovery since december sigeco s natural gas territory has an nta since  and lost margin recovery began when new base rates went into effect august  the ohio service territory has lost margin recovery since october  but does not have an nta mechanism 
sigeco s electric service territory does not have an nta mechanism but has recovery of past demand side management costs 
gas and electric margin generated from sales to large customers generally industrial and other contract customers is primarily impacted by overall economic conditions 
margin is also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which fluctuate with gas and fuel costs  as well as other tracked expenses 
expenses subject to tracking mechanisms include ohio bad debts and percent of income payment plan expenses  indiana gas pipeline integrity management costs  and costs to fund indiana energy efficiency programs 
certain operating costs associated with operating environmental compliance equipment were also tracked prior to their recovery in base rates that went into effect on august  the august sigeco rate orders also provide for the tracking of miso revenues and costs  as well as the gas cost component of bad debt expense and unaccounted for gas 
electric generating asset optimization activities are primarily affected by market conditions  the level of excess generating capacity  and electric transmission availability 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other customers sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes gas utility margins were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to residential and commercial customer usage  including lost margin recovery  increased margin million year over year 
for all of  ohio weather was percent warmer than normal  but approximately percent colder than the prior year and resulted in an estimated increase in margin of approximately million compared to margin increases associated with the vectren south base rate increase  effective august   were million 
recovery of gas storage carrying costs in ohio was million 
lastly  operating costs  including revenue and usage taxes recovered dollar for dollar in margin  increased gas margin million year over year 
during  the company resolved all remaining issues related to a disallowance by the puco of gas costs incurred by the ohio utility operations  resulting in an additional charge of million 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased for the year ended december   was compared to in and in gas utility margins were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to a full year of base rate increases implemented in the company s ohio service territory which increased margin million  a million disallowance of ohio gas costs in  the effects of the nta implemented in in the company s indiana service territories  and the lost margin recovery authorizations implemented in the fourth quarter of  more than offset the effects of warm weather  lower usage  and decreased tracked expenses recovered dollar for dollar in margin 

table of contents for the year ended december   compared to  management estimates that weather percent warmer than normal and percent warmer than prior year would have decreased margins million compared to the prior year  had the nta not been in effect 
weather  net of the nta  resulted in an approximate million year over year increase in gas utility margin 
incremental revenue associated with the lost margin recovery totaled million in further  for the year ended december   margin associated with tracked expenses and revenue taxes decreased million 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel and purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipal other customers subtotal retail firm wholesale asset optimization electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipal other customers total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail firm wholesale margin electric retail and firm wholesale utility margins was million for the year ended december  this represents an increase over the prior year of million  respectively 
management estimates the year over year increases in usage by residential and commercial customers due to weather to be million 
the base rate increase that went into effect on august   produced incremental margin of million 
during  cooling degree days were percent above normal compared to percent below normal in recovery of pollution control investments and expenses increased margin million year over year 
electric retail and firm wholesale utility margin was million for the year ended december  and was generally flat compared to the recovery of pollution control related investments and associated operating expenses and related depreciation increased margins million year over year 
higher demand charges and other items increased industrial customer margin approximately million year over year 
these increases were offset by decreased residential and commercial usage 
the decreased usage was due primarily to mild weather during the peak cooling season 
for compared to  the estimated decrease in margin due to unfavorable weather was million million for below normal cooling weather and million for below normal heating weather 
in  cooling degree days were percent above normal 
margin from asset optimization activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve native load and firm wholesale customers 
the company markets and sells this unutilized generating and transmission capacity to optimize the return on its owned assets 
a majority of the margin generated from these activities is associated with wholesale off system sales  and substantially all off system sales occur into the miso day ahead market 

table of contents asset optimization activity is comprised of the following year ended december  in millions off system sales transmission system sales other total asset optimization for the year ended december   net asset optimization margins were million  which represents an increase of million  compared to the increase is primarily due to losses on financial contracts experienced in and higher fourth quarter wholesale prices 
margins in decreased million when compared to primarily due to the financial contract losses experienced in and lower volumes sold off system 
in  the availability of excess capacity was reduced by scheduled outages associated with the installation of environmental compliance equipment 
off system sales totaled gwh in  compared to gwh in and  gwh in utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  which represents an increase of million  compared to operating costs recovered dollar for dollar in margin  including costs funding new indiana energy efficiency programs  increased million year over year 
increases in operating costs associated with lost margin recovery and conservation initiatives that are not directly recovered in margin were million year over year 
costs directly attributable to the vectren south rate cases  including amortization of prior deferred costs  totaled million in expenses in are offset by the gain on the sale of a storage asset of approximately million 
the remaining increases are primarily due to increased wage and benefit costs 
the million gain on sale of a storage asset  partially offset by higher electric generation chemical costs and bad debt expense in the company s indiana service territories were the primary factors decreasing operating expense in compared to depreciation amortization depreciation expense increased million in compared to and million in compared to the increases were primarily due to increased utility plant in service 
expense in also includes million of amortization associated with prior electric demand side management costs pursuant to the august   electric base rate order 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared the fluctuations are primarily attributable to variations in utility receipts  excise  and usage taxes 
these variations resulted primarily from volatility in revenues and gas volumes sold 
in and  property taxes also increased due to increased plant in service 
other income net other net reflects income of million in compared to million in and million in the increases relate primarily to the capitalization of funds used during construction due to increased capital spending and higher interest income 
utility group interest expense in  interest expense increased million compared to and increased million in compared to the increases are primarily driven by rising interest rates during the period and are also impacted by higher levels of short term borrowings 

table of contents the increase was mitigated somewhat by the full impact of financing transactions completed in october in which approximately million in debt related proceeds were raised and used to retire debt with a higher interest rate 
interest costs in reflect permanent financing transactions completed in the fourth quarter of in which million in debt related proceeds were received and used to retire short term borrowings and other long term debt 
utility group income taxes federal and state income taxes increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the changes are impacted primarily by fluctuations in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate in the lower effective tax rate in primarily relates to a million favorable impact for an indiana tax law change that resulted in the recalculation of certain state deferred income tax liabilities 
income taxes in also include other adjustments  including adjustments to reflect income taxes reported on state and federal income tax returns 
income taxes recorded in reflect favorable adjustments to accruals resulting from the conclusion of state tax audits and other adjustments 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  and local regulations with respect to environmental matters  principally air  solid waste  and water quality 
pursuant to environmental regulations  the company is required to obtain operating permits for the electric generating plants that it owns or operates and construction permits for any new plants it might propose to build 
regulations concerning air quality establish standards with respect to both ambient air quality and emissions from electric generating facilities  including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox  and mercury 
regulations concerning water quality establish standards relating to intake and discharge of water from electric generating facilities  including water used for cooling purposes in electric generating facilities 
because of the scope and complexity of these regulations  the company is unable to predict the ultimate effect of such regulations on its future operations 
clean air climate change in march of usepa finalized two new air emission reduction regulations 
the clean air interstate rule cair is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide so emissions from coal burning power plants 
the clean air mercury rule camr is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in mercury emissions from coal burning power plants 
both sets of regulations require emission reductions in two phases 
the first phase deadline for both rules is for nox under cair  and the second phase deadline for compliance with the emission reductions required under cair is  while the second phase deadline for compliance with the emission reduction requirements of camr is however  on february   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the federal camr regulations 
at this time it is uncertain how this decision will affect indiana s recently finalized camr implementation program 
to comply with indiana s implementation plan of the clean air act of and to further comply with cair and camr of  sigeco has received authority from the iurc to invest in clean coal technology 
using this authorization  sigeco invested approximately million in selective catalytic reduction scr systems at its coal fired generating stations 
scr technology is the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required 
to further reduce particulate matter emissions  the company invested approximately million in a fabric filter at its largest generating unit mw 
these investments were included in rate base for purposes of determining new base rates that went into effect on august   see rate and regulatory matter section 
prior to being included in base rates  return on investments made and recovery of related operating expenses were recovered through a rider mechanism 
further  the iurc granted sigeco authority to invest in an so scrubber at its generating facility that is jointly owned with alcoa the company s portion is mw 
the order  as updated with an increased spending level  allows sigeco to recover an approximate percent return on up to million  excluding 
table of contents afudc  in capital investments through a rider mechanism which is updated every six months for actual costs incurred 
the company may file periodic updates with the iurc requesting modification to the spending authority 
as of december   the company has invested approximately million in this project 
the company expects the so scrubber will be operational in at that time  operating expenses including depreciation expense associated with the scrubber will also be recovered through a rider mechanism 
once the so scrubber is operational  sigeco s coal fired generating fleet will be percent scrubbed for so and percent controlled for nox 
the use of scr technology positions the company to be in compliance with the cair deadlines specifying reductions in nox emissions by and further reductions by not only does sigeco s investments in scrubber  scr and fabric filter technology position it to comply with reductions described in the original mercury emission regulations and indiana s current camr implementation plans  it will also likely comply with more stringent mercury reductions that might follow from revised regulations 
if legislation requiring reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases or mandating energy from renewable sources is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel generating plants and nonutility coal mining operations 
at this time and in the absence of final legislation  compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain 
sigeco is studying renewable energy alternatives  and on april   filed a green power rider in order to allow customers to purchase green power and to obtain approval of a contract to purchase mw of power generated by wind energy 
the wind contract has been approved 
future filings with the iurc with regard to new generation and or further environmental compliance plans will include evaluation of potential carbon requirements 
environmental remediation efforts in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  those that operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january indiana gas submitted the remainder of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
indiana gas accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which serve to limit indiana gas share of response costs at these sites to between percent and percent 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received and recorded settlements from all known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these plants were in operation in an aggregate amount approximating million 
in october  sigeco received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants that it owned and or operated and were not enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in october  sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem in february sigeco is also named in a lawsuit filed in federal district court in may  involving another site subject to potential environmental remediation efforts 

table of contents sigeco has filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program and or related to the site subject to the may lawsuit 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  sigeco has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
with respect to insurance coverage  sigeco has received and recorded settlements from insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these sites were in operation in an aggregate amount approximating the costs it expects to incur 
environmental remediation costs related to indiana gas and sigeco s manufactured gas plants and other sites have had no material impact on results of operations or financial condition since costs recorded to date approximate prp and insurance settlement recoveries 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to prp or insurance recovery 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the usepa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the usepa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the usepa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren s wagner operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination  nor does the usepa s soil testing to date indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
at this time  vectren anticipates only additional soil testing could be requested by the usepa at some future date 
rate and regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause  and rates in ohio contain a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
gca and gcr clauses allow the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an agreed upon benchmark  is also recovered through regulatory proceedings 
the current benchmark expires in march a settlement agreement between the company and the oucc to modify and extend the benchmark is awaiting iurc action 
an order is expected during the first quarter of gca  gcr  and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc and puco hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in margin 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
the company has not surpassed the limits of the earnings test in the recent past 

table of contents vectren north indiana gas company  inc gas base rate order received on february   the company received an order from the iurc which approved its vectren north gas rate case 
the order provided for a base rate increase of million and an roe of percent  with an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately million 
the settlement also provides for the recovery of million of costs through separate cost recovery mechanisms rather than base rates 
further  additional expenditures for a multi year bare steel and cast iron capital replacement program will be afforded certain accounting treatment that mitigates earnings attrition from the investment between rate cases 
the accounting treatment allows for the continuation of the accrual for allowance for funds used during construction afudc and the deferral of depreciation expense after the projects go in service but before they are included in base rates 
to qualify for this treatment  the annual expenditures are limited to million and the treatment cannot extend beyond four years on each project 
with this order  the company has in place for its north gas territory weather normalization  a conservation and lost margin recovery tariff  tracking of gas cost expense related to bad debts and unaccounted for gas through the existing gas cost adjustment mechanism  and tracking of pipeline integrity expense 
vectren south sigeco electric base rate order received on august   the company received an order from the iurc which approved its vectren south electric rate case 
the settlement agreement provides for an approximate million electric rate increase to cover the company s cost of system growth  maintenance  safety and reliability 
the settlement provides for  among other things recovery of ongoing costs and deferred costs associated with the miso  operations and maintenance o m expense increases related to managing the aging workforce  including the development of expanded apprenticeship programs and the creation of defined training programs to ensure proper knowledge transfer  safety and system stability  increased o m expense necessary to maintain and improve system reliability  benefit to customers from the sale of wholesale power by vectren s sharing equally with customers any profit earned above or below million of wholesale power margin  recovery of and return on the investment in past demand side management programs to help encourage conservation during peak load periods  timely recovery of the company s investment in certain new electric transmission projects that benefit the miso infrastructure  an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately  million and an allowed return on equity roe of percent 
the increase in electric utility margin as a result of this order totaled million in vectren south sigeco gas base rate order received on august   the company received an order from the iurc which approved its vectren south gas rate case 
the order provided for a base rate increase of million and an roe of percent  with an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately million 
the settlement also provides for the recovery of million of costs through separate cost recovery mechanisms rather than base rates 
further  additional expenditures for a multi year bare steel and cast iron capital replacement program will be afforded certain accounting treatment that mitigates earnings attrition from the investment between rate cases 
the accounting treatment allows for the continuation of the accrual for allowance for funds used during construction afudc and the deferral of depreciation expense after the projects go in service but before they are included in base rates 
to qualify for this treatment  the annual expenditures are limited to million and the treatment cannot extend beyond three years on each project 
with this order  the company now has in place for its south gas territory weather normalization  a conservation and lost margin recovery tariff  tracking of gas cost expense related to bad debts and unaccounted for gas through the existing gas cost adjustment mechanism  and tracking of pipeline integrity expense 
the increase in gas utility margin as a result of this order totaled million in vectren energy delivery of ohio  inc vedo gas base rate case filing in november  the company filed with the puco a request for an increase in its base rates and charges for vedo s distribution business in its county service area in west central ohio 
the filing indicates that an increase in base rates of approximately million is necessary to cover the ongoing cost of operating  maintaining and expanding the approximately  mile distribution system used to serve  customers 
in addition  the company is seeking to increase the level of the monthly service charge as well as extending the lost margin recovery mechanism currently in place to be able to encourage customer conservation and is also seeking approval of expanded conservation oriented programs  such as rebate offerings on high efficiency natural gas appliances for existing and new home construction  to help customers lower their natural gas bills 
the company is also seeking approval of a multi year bare steel and cast iron capital replacement program 
the company anticipates an order from the puco in late ohio and indiana lost margin recovery conservation filings in  the company filed conservation programs and conservation adjustment trackers in indiana and ohio designed to help customers conserve energy and reduce their annual gas bills 
the proposed programs would allow the company to recover costs of promoting the conservation of natural gas through conservation trackers that work in tandem with a lost margin recovery mechanism 
these mechanisms are designed to allow the company to recover the distribution portion of its rates from residential and commercial customers based on the level of customer revenues established in each utility s last general rate case 
indiana in december  the iurc approved a settlement agreement that provides for a five year energy efficiency program 
it allows the company s indiana utilities to recover a majority of the costs of promoting the conservation of natural gas through conservation trackers that work in tandem with a lost margin recovery mechanism 
the order was implemented in the north service territory in december  and provides for recovery of percent of the difference between weather normalized revenues actually collected by the company and the revenues approved in the company s most recent rate case 
energy efficiency programs began in the north gas territory in december a similar approach regarding lost margin recovery commenced in the south gas territory on august   as the new base rates went into effect  allowing for recovery of percent of the difference between weather normalized revenues collected and the revenues approved in that rate case 
the recent vectren north base rate order also allows for full recovery of the difference between weather normalized revenues collected by the company and the revenues provided for in that settlement  superseding the original december order 
while most expenses associated with these programs are recoverable  in the first program year the company incurred million in program costs without recovery  of which million was expensed in and  in addition contributed million in assets that are being depreciated over the term of the program without recovery 
ohio in june  the public utilities commission of ohio puco approved a settlement that provides for the implementation of a lost margin recovery mechanism and a related conservation program for the company s ohio operations 
this order confirms the guidance the puco previously provided in a september decision 
the conservation program  as outlined in the september puco order and as affirmed in this order  provides for a two year  million total conservation program to be paid by the company  as well as a sales reconciliation rider intended to be a recovery mechanism for the difference between the weather normalized revenues actually collected by the company and the revenues approved by the puco in the company s most recent rate case 
approximately percent of the company s ohio customers are eligible for the conservation programs 
the ohio consumer counselor occ and another intervener requested a rehearing of the june order and the puco granted that request in order to have additional time to consider the merits of the request 
in accordance with accounting authorization previously provided by the puco  the company began recognizing the impact of the september order on october   and has recognized cumulative revenues of million  of which million was recorded in the occ appealed the puco s accounting authorization to the ohio supreme court  but that appeal has been dismissed as premature pending the puco s consideration of issues raised in the occ s request for rehearing 
since october   the company has been ratably accruing its million commitment 

table of contents miso since february and with the iurc s approval  the company has been a member of the midwest independent system operator  inc miso  a ferc approved regional transmission organization 
the miso serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest and maintains operational control over the company s electric transmission facilities as well as that of other midwest utilities 
on april   the miso energy market commenced operation the day energy market 
as a result of being a market participant  the company now bids its owned generation into the day ahead and real time markets and procures power for its retail customers at locational marginal pricing lmp as determined by the miso market 
the company is typically in a net sales position with miso and is only occasionally in a net purchase position 
net positions are determined on an hourly basis 
when the company is a net seller such net revenues are included in electric utility revenues and when the company is a net purchaser such net purchases are included in cost of fuel and purchased power 
the company also receives transmission revenue that results from other members use of the company s transmission system 
these revenues are also included in electric utility revenues 
pursuant to an order from the iurc received in december  certain miso startup costs referred to as day costs were deferred  and those deferred costs are now being recovered through base rates that went into effect on august  on june   vectren  together with three other indiana electric utilities  received regulatory authority from the iurc to recover fuel related costs and to defer other costs associated with the day energy market 
the order allows fuel related costs to be passed through to customers in vectren s existing fuel cost recovery proceedings 
during  the iurc reaffirmed the definition of certain costs as fuel related  the company is following those guidelines 
other miso fuel related and non fuel related administrative costs were deferred  and those deferred costs are now being recovered through base rates that went into effect on august  the iurc order authorizing new base rates also provides for a tracking mechanism associated with ongoing miso related costs and transmission revenues 
as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market has been  and may continue to be  impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives  and a pending day market  where miso plans to provide bid based regulation and contingency operating reserve markets  it is difficult to predict near term operational impacts 
miso has indicated that the day ancillary services market would begin in june the need to expend capital for improvements to the transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years is expected to be significant 
the company will timely recover its investment in certain new electric transmission projects that benefit the miso infrastructure at a ferc approved rate of return 
weather normalization on october   the iurc approved the establishment of a normal temperature adjustment nta mechanism for vectren energy delivery of indiana 
the oucc had previously entered into a settlement agreement with vectren energy delivery of indiana providing for the nta 
the nta affects the company s indiana regulated residential and commercial natural gas customers and should mitigate weather risk in those customer classes during the october to april heating season 
these indiana customer classes represent approximately percent of the company s total natural gas heating load 

table of contents the nta mechanism will mitigate volatility in distribution charges created by fluctuations in weather by lowering customer bills when weather is colder than normal and increasing customer bills when weather is warmer than normal 
the nta has been applied to meters read and bills rendered after october  each subsequent monthly bill for the seven month heating season is adjusted using the nta 
revenues attributable to this order were million in and million in while a downward adjustment to revenues of million resulted in the order provides that the company will make  on a monthly basis  a commitment of  to a universal service fund program or other low income assistance program for the duration of the nta or until a general rate case 
sigeco s portion of its commitment ceased in august  and indiana gas portion of the commitment ceased on february  rate structures in the company s indiana electric territory and ohio gas territory do not include weather normalization type clauses 
vedo base rate increase in on april   the puco approved a million base rate increase for vedo s gas distribution business 
the base rate change was implemented on april  and provide for the recovery of some level of on going costs to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of gas cost recovery gcr audit proceedings in  the puco issued an order disallowing the recovery of approximately million of gas costs relating to the two year audit period ended october and in  an additional million was disallowed related to the audit period ending october the initial audit period provided the puco staff its initial review of the portfolio administration arrangement between vedo and proliance 
since november   the company has used a provider other than proliance for these services 
through a series of rehearings and appeals  including action by the ohio supreme court in the first quarter of  the company was required to refund million to customers 
in total  the company has reflected million in cost of gas sold related to this matter  of which million  million and million were recorded in   and  respectively 
the impact of the disallowance includes a sharing of the ordered refund by vectren s partner in proliance 
as of december   all amounts have been refunded to customers

coal mining operations  inclusive of holding company costs  earned approximately million in compared to million in and million in the decline in earnings in is primarily due to the effects of compliance with revised mine safety and health administration msha seal guidelines and the associated lost production and higher sulfur content from coal mined under a revised mining plan 
these decreases are offset somewhat by reduced operating costs from highwall mining at the cypress creek surface mine 
mining operations earnings were generally flat compared to higher revenue and tax benefits from depletion were offset by unfavorable geologic conditions  the rising costs of commodities used in operations  and high sulfur content 
the company produced million tons of coal in  compared to million tons in and million tons in earnings in from coal mining operations are expected to increase due to price increases of to percent  the return to full production at prosperity mine  and process improvements that mitigate impacts from increased msha inspections

the internal revenue code provides for manufacturers  such as pace carbon  to receive a tax credit for every ton of synthetic fuel sold 
in addition  vectren fuels  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary involved in coal mining  received processing fees from synfuel producers unrelated to pace carbon for a portion of its coal production 
the tax law authorizing synfuel related credits and fees expired on december  the internal revenue service issued private letter rulings  which concluded the synthetic fuel produced at the pace carbon facilities should qualify for tax credits 
the irs has completed tax audits of pace carbon for the years through without challenging tax credit calculations 
generally  the statute of limitations for the irs to audit a tax return is three years from filing

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  however  the standard will impact how other fair value based gaap is applied 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  however  in december  the fasb issued proposed fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp

the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with few exceptions  is an irrevocable election and is applied only to entire instruments 
the company will adopt sfas on january   and does not expect that adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements and results of operations 

table of contents sfas revised in december  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations sfas 
sfas establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of an entity recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree recognizes and measures acquired goodwill or a bargain purchase gain and determines what information to disclose in its financial statements in order to enable users to assess the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity acquires control of one or more businesses and applies to all business entities 
sfas applies prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the company will adopt sfas on january   and because the provisions of this standard are applied prospectively  the impact to the company cannot be determined until the transactions occur 
sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards that require that the ownership percentages in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled  and presented separately from the parent s equity in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement  that changes in the parent s ownership interest while it retains control over its subsidiary be accounted for consistently  that when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment be initially measured at fair value  and that sufficient disclosure is made to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the noncontrolling owners 
sfas applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except for non profit entities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the company will adopt sfas on january   and is currently assessing the impact this statement will have on its financial statements and results of operations 
critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates  in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and nonutility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  valuing derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts and coal reserves  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents impairment review of investments the company has investments in notes receivable  entities accounted for using the cost method of accounting  and entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs both a qualitative and quantitative review of that investment and when necessary performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of cost method and equity method investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations 
in  the company examined the recoverability of several investments  including a leveraged lease and a note receivable 
the company determined the carrying values of the investments tested were not impaired 
for the lease  this assessment was based on a recent nonbinding offer from an unrelated party to purchase the underlying property 
however  a sale price percent below that received would have resulted in a small charge to earnings 
for the note  a qualitative assessment was made regarding collection using the note agreement s breach of contract provisions 
based on that review  the company believes collection is probable 
in  the company fully impaired its investment in pace carbon 
the company took this action because of the effect high oil prices had on pace carbon s future operations 
the write off of the investment and expensing of future funding requirements totaled million  or million after tax in goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to sfas  the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the reporting unit 
nonutility group reporting units are generally defined as the operating companies that aggregate that operating segment 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount in   and and therefore resulted in no impairment 
goodwill related to the nonutility group was generally tested during the year using market comparable data or a discounted cash flow model 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
the company also annually tests non amortizing intangible assets for impairment and amortizing intangible assets are tested on an event and circumstance basis 
during   and  these tests yielded no impairment charges 
pension and other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company currently measures its obligations annually on september however  the company is in the process of moving is measurement date to december the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of percent percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent percent  and an inflation assumption of percent percent 
during  the company increased the discount rate by basis points to value ending pension and postretirement obligations and benefit cost due to an increase in benchmark interest rates 
future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 

table of contents management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate would generally increase periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units by customer class 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
while certain estimates are used in the calculation of unbilled revenue  the method from which these estimates are derived is not subject to near term changes 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria of sfas  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant

table of contents financing cash flow although working capital requirements are generally funded by cash flow from operations  the company uses short term borrowings to supplement working capital needs when accounts receivable balances are at their highest and gas storage is refilled 
additionally  short term borrowings are required for capital projects and investments until they are financed on a long term basis 
cash flow required for financing activities reflects the impact of recently executed long term financing  increases in common stock dividends over the periods presented  and changes in short term borrowings 
in financing activities were generally flat  with short term and long term debt proceeds and stock option proceeds offsetting debt payments and dividends

common stock offering in february  the company sold million authorized but previously unissued shares of its common stock to a group of underwriters in an sec registered primary offering at a price of per share 
the transaction generated proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of approximately million 
the company executed an equity forward sale agreement equity forward in connection with the offering  and therefore  did not receive proceeds at the time of the equity offering 
the equity forward allows the company to price an offering under market conditions existing at that time  and to better match the receipt of the offering proceeds and the associated share dilution with the implementation of regulatory initiatives  providing a return on the new equity employed 
the offering proceeds  when and if received  will be used to permanently finance primarily electric utility capital expenditures 

table of contents in connection with the equity forward  an affiliate of one of the underwriters the forward seller  at the company s request  borrowed an equal number of shares of the company s common stock from institutional stock lenders and sold those borrowed shares to the public in the primary offering 
the company will receive an amount equal to the net proceeds from that sale  subject to certain adjustments defined in the equity forward  upon full share settlement of the equity forward 
those adjustments defined in the equity forward include daily increases in the forward sale price based on a floating interest factor equal to the federal funds rate  less a basis point fixed spread  and structured quarterly decreases to the forward sale price that align with expected company dividend payments 
the company may elect to settle the equity forward in shares or in cash  except in specified circumstances or events where the counterparty to the equity forward could force a share settlement 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the company making dividend payments greater than the structured quarterly decreases identified in the equity forward or the company repurchasing a number of its outstanding common shares over a specified threshold 
if the company elects to settle in shares  the maximum number of shares deliverable by the company is million shares 
if the company elects to settle in cash  an affiliate of one of the underwriters the forward purchaser would purchase shares in the market and return those shares to the stock lenders 
the company will either owe or be owed funds depending upon the company s average share price during the unwind period defined in the equity forward in relation to the equity forward s contracted price 
generally  if the equity forward s contracted price is lower than the average share price during the unwind period  then the company would owe cash  and if the average share price during the unwind period is less than the equity forward s contracted price  the company would receive cash 
proceeds received or paid when the equity forward is settled will be recorded in common shareholders equity  even if settled in cash 
the equity forward must be settled prior to february  the equity forward had an initial forward price of per share  representing the public offering price of per share  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
management therefore estimated the contract had no initial fair value 
if the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at december   the company would have received approximately million based on a forward price of for the million shares 
if the company had elected to settle the equity forward in cash at december   the company estimates it would have paid approximately million  assuming the price in the unwind period approximates the trailing three month average of vectren s stock price

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company may also execute derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity for the benefit of retail customers due to current indiana and ohio regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
constructive regulatory orders  such as that authorizing lost margin recovery and recovery of unaccounted for gas and other gas related expenses  also mitigate the effect volatile gas costs may have on the company s financial condition 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices have other effects such as higher working capital requirements  higher interest costs  and some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
the company will manage these risks by executing derivative contracts that hedge the price of forecasted natural gas purchases 
these contracts are subject to regulation which allows for reasonable and prudent hedging costs to be recovered through rates 
therefore  sfas controls when the offset to mark to market accounting is recognized in earnings 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities include asset optimization strategies that manage the utilization of available electric generating capacity 
these optimization strategies involve the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also execute energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in the future 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for asset optimization contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
no market sensitive derivative positions were outstanding on december  and other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  and coal 
other commodity related operations include regulated sales of electricity to certain municipalities  nonutility retail gas marketing  and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company purchases and sells commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
the company executes forward contracts and occasionally option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may or may not occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions under sfas  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 

table of contents unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company manages this risk by allowing an annual average of percent and percent of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  this targeted range may be exceeded during the seasonal increases in short term borrowing 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements approximated million and million  respectively 
at december  and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
at december   sigeco has approximately million of tax exempt adjustable rate long term debt where the interest rates on this debt are reset every seven days through an auction process 
throughout  the weighted average interest rate associated with this debt was percent 
if these auctions were to fail  interest rates would reset to the maximum rates permitted under the various debt indentures of percent to percent for the following week 
on a weekly basis  interest expense using these maximum rates would be approximately  higher than the average weekly interest expense based on rates experienced during no sigeco auctions failed during nor have they during the period since vectren was formed in however  in february  significant disruptions occurred in the overall auction rate debt markets 
as a result  many auctions of tax exempt debt  including some of those involving sigeco s auction rate debt  failed as a result of insufficient order interest from potential investors 
these failures are largely attributable to a lack of liquidity in the market place arising from downgrades in  and negative watches regarding  credit ratings of monoline insurers that guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest if an issuer defaults as well as from disruptions in the overall financial markets 
monoline insurer ambac assurance corporation insures the company s auction rate long term debt 
as a result of these failed auctions  the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  increased interest costs 
subject to applicable notice provisions  sigeco may  at its option  redeem this auction rate debt at par value plus the accrued and unpaid interest or elect to utilize other interest rate modes available to it as defined in the various debt indentures 
sigeco is in the process of providing notice to current holders of this debt that it will be converted from the auction rate mode into a daily interest rate mode during march and the debt will be subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the conversion date at percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
following conversion to the daily mode  sigeco maintains its options to again convert the debt to other interest rate modes and remarket it to investors or redeem the debt and reissue new debt  including the possibility of replacing it with taxable debt from utility holdings 
other risks by using forward purchase contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage risk  the company  as well as proliance  exposes itself to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from a diversified base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
in addition  credit risk is mitigated by regulatory orders that allow recovery of all bad debt expense in ohio and the gas cost portion of bad debt expense in indiana
