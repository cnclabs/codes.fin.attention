item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of stoneridge  inc the company 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
we are an independent designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components  modules and systems for the automotive  medium and heavy duty truck  agricultural and off highway vehicle markets 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of million compared with million for the year ended december  our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for our increase in net sales was predominantly attributable to increased european commercial vehicle production  new program launches in both north america and europe and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase was partially offset by the substantial decline in north american medium and heavy duty truck production and a decline in north american light vehicle production 
medium and heavy duty truck production was unfavorably impacted by the new diesel emissions regulations that were implemented on january  in the us our profitability was positively affected by new program sales during the year  especially in the third and fourth quarters 
during  our sensor business launched over million in new business revenue and our aftermarket business in europe grew by approximately million in revenue as we continued to penetrate new geographic markets and expand our product offerings 
we received new business to supply electronic products to a military vehicle program  which is expected to continue through the first half of we were also able to partially offset direct material cost increases through hedging transactions for copper and fixed price supplier agreements for zinc 
in addition  we received cash and recorded gains from the divestiture of non strategic assets  which included two idle facilities and the company s airplane in our increase in profitability was partially offset by increased depreciation expense and direct material costs as well as operational inefficiencies related to new product launches and supply chain management 
in addition  the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased due to additional spending in sales and marketing support for a new product launch  higher design and development expenses  increased systems implementation costs and a million one time gain related to the settlement of the life insurance benefits portion of a postretirement plan in also affecting our profitability were restructuring initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of to improve the company s manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  england locations 
related expenses  primarily comprised of one time termination benefits  were approximately million 
we anticipate incurring total pre tax charges of approximately million to million in for the restructuring  net of an expected gain from a future sarasota facility sale 
we expect these initiatives to be substantially completed in and are expecting projected benefits to be in the range of million to million in and beyond 
also in  our pst eletr nica sa pst joint venture in brazil  which is an electronic system provider focused on security and convenience applications primarily for the vehicle and motorcycle industry  continued to perform well  resulting in equity earnings of million compared to million in the previous year 
we also received dividend payments from pst of million and million in and  respectively 
on october   we announced that our pst joint venture filed certain financial information with the brazilian securities commission comiss o de valores mobili rios 
we currently hold a equity interest in pst 

table of contents outlook we expect production levels in the north american automotive and commercial vehicle markets to be slightly lower than and the european commercial vehicle market to be comparable to we also expect that our sales will be favorably affected by new program sales 
we expect that the us diesel emissions regulations adopted in will continue to negatively impact medium and heavy duty truck production in the us and our financial results through the first half of for our electronics reportable segment  we anticipate that new program sales and stable demand outside of the us will offset the continued downturn in the us medium and heavy duty truck production 
we expect our automotive related sales to be stagnant or slightly decline compared to levels 
for our control devices reportable segment  we expect continued growth in our emissions sensing and other new products  however  these increases will be offset by customer demanded price reductions and forecasted lower market share for our traditional north american automotive original equipment manufacturers 
significant factors inherent to our markets that could affect our results for include general economic conditions and the financial stability of our customers and suppliers as well as our ability to successfully execute our planned restructuring  productivity and cost reduction initiatives 
we are undertaking these initiatives to mitigate commodity price increases and customer demanded price reductions 
our management team is focused on improving operational efficiency while adapting to the needs of our customers 
our results for also depend on conditions in the automotive and commercial vehicle markets  which are generally dependent on domestic and international economies 
we continue our transition to low cost manufacturing locations 
initially  this initiative will result in restructuring costs stemming from facility closures and production relocations 
however  the longer term effects of such an initiative will enable us to reduce our operating costs and increase global sourcing capacity to our customers 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this organizational structure  our operations have been aggregated into two reportable segments electronics and control devices 
the electronics reportable segment  formerly known as the vehicle management power distribution reportable segment  includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution 
the control devices reportable segment includes results from our operations that design and manufacture electronic and electromechanical switches  control actuation devices and sensors 
during the third quarter of  a european operating segment in the control devices reportable segment experienced a change in future business prospects due to the loss of a significant customer contract 
as a result  the company announced that it would cease manufacturing at this location and transfer remaining production to an operating segment in the electronics reportable segment 
in addition  management and oversight responsibilities for this business were realigned to the electronics reportable segment 
because the company changed the structure of its internal organization in a manner that caused the composition of its reportable segments to change  the corresponding information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current year reportable segment presentation 
beginning in  we changed from a calendar year end to a week fiscal year end 
since then  our fiscal quarters were comprised of week periods 
on october   we changed back to a calendar december fiscal year end  and therefore the and fiscal years ended on december  and december   respectively 
our fiscal quarters are now comprised of three month periods

the increase in sg a expenses  excluding product development expenses  in compared with was primarily attributable to the increase in our selling and marketing activity to support new products in europe  the increase in systems implementation expenses related to a new information system in europe  and a million one time gain in the third quarter of related to the settlement of the life insurance benefits portion of a postretirement plan 
restructuring charges 
the increase in restructuring charges was primarily the result of one time termination benefits related to the restructuring initiatives announced in to improve manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  england locations 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
we expect these initiatives to be substantially completed in

the increase was offset by higher sg a related to increased development spending in the areas of tachographs and instrumentation and higher selling and marketing costs associated with new product introductions 
provision for income taxes 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of million  or of pre tax income  and million  or of the pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the increase in higher taxed domestic earnings and the increase over the prior year of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in the united kingdom

net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the fiscal years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices total net sales the increase in net sales for our electronics segment was primarily due to increased sales to our commercial vehicle customers because north american demand was strong during the year 
the most significant factor behind the increase in demand was related to the implementation of more stringent diesel emissions standards in the us overall commercial vehicle demand increased in in anticipation of the emission changes 
in addition to the north american volume increase  our revenues also increased as a result of new product sales in europe and a million impact from foreign currency exchange rates for the year 
net sales for our control devices segment declined as a result of lower production volumes at the traditional domestic automakers and product price reductions 
these declines were partially offset by new product sales in our european operations

the increase in our profitability outside north america was primarily due to the operational improvement at our united kingdom operations  which experienced significant operational inefficiencies in  and increased sales volume 
these improvements were partially offset by costs related to the start up of our suzhou  china  manufacturing facility 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of million  or of pre tax income  and million  or of the pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in pre tax earnings and a corresponding reduction in the amount of additional valuation allowance needed that resulted from the improved performance of our united kingdom operations 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase decrease cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a larger investment in working capital 
specifically  cash used to finance movements in working capital asset and liability accounts was a use of funds in the current year of million versus an increase of funds of million in the prior year 
higher working capital requirements in were driven by our restructuring initiatives and increased sales in the fourth quarter of to customers with contractually longer payment terms 
the decrease in net cash used by investing activities was attributable to the million in proceeds from the divestiture of non strategic assets  which included two idle facilities and the company airplane in in addition  we used million less cash for capital projects in compared to the prior period 
in  we invested million in our minda stoneridge instruments limited joint venture and received cash of million from the sale of our partnership interest in ida 
cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and was primarily related to proceeds from the exercise of share options  partially offset by cash used for fees related to the completion of our credit agreement amendment during the first quarter of and the completion of our new asset based credit facility in the fourth quarter of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s senior notes and credit facilities

these contracts fixed the cost of copper purchases in and expired on december  in december  we entered into another fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which will last through december the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
as of december   the fair value of the fixed price commodity swap contract  per quoted market sources  was approximately million 

table of contents the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments  as of december  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases employee benefit plans uncertain income tax benefits total contractual obligations see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our uncertain income tax benefits 
future capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with recent levels 
management will continue to focus on reducing its weighted average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs 
as outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements  on november   we finalized our new asset based credit facility  which permits borrowing up to a maximum level of million 
this facility provides us with lower borrowing rates and allows us the flexibility to refinance our outstanding debt 
at december   there were no borrowings on this asset based credit facility 
the available borrowing capacity on this credit facility is based on eligible current assets  as defined 
at december   the company had borrowing capacity of million based on eligible current assets 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  as of may  the company s million senior notes were redeemable at 
given the company s senior notes are redeemable  we may seek to retire the senior notes through a redemption  cash purchases  open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such redemptions  purchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
in  we have purchased and retired million in face value of our senior notes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced that its pst joint venture filed certain financial information with the brazilian securities commission comiss o de valores mobili rios 
the company currently holds a equity interest in pst 
we also received dividend payments from pst of million and million in and  respectively 
in future years  we expect but cannot guarantee that we will receive dividend payments from pst 
we continue our transition to low cost manufacturing locations that will enable us to reduce our operating costs and provide global sourcing capacity to our customers 
such initiatives will result in restructuring costs stemming from facility closures and production relocations 
we are presently having a new facility constructed  which will expand our leased manufacturing capacity in estonia 
we announced restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of and expect them to be substantially complete by december  we anticipate incurring total pre tax charges of approximately million to million in for the restructuring  net of the gain on the future sale of our sarasota facility 
inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent increases or fluctuations in certain commodity prices  we believe that a continuation of such price increases would significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries 
based on the current economic conditions in these countries  we believe we are not significantly exposed to adverse exchange rate risk or economic conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns and historical trends in sales returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 

table of contents we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for us inventories and by the first in  first out fifo method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the estimate for our share based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data  future expectations and the expected term of the share based compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the expected long term return on assets is determined as a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class held by the defined benefit pension plan at the date 
the expected return on bonds has been based on the yield available on similar bonds by currency  issuer and duration at that date 
the expected return on equities is based on an equity risk premium of return above that available on long term government bonds of a similar duration and the same currency as the liabilities 
discount rates for our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom are determined using the average long term sterling aa corporate bond 
on december   the yield was approximately  with the individual yields on most of these yields of most of the bonds being within a range of 
discount rates for our other postretirement benefit plan in the us are determined using the moody s aa corporate bond index 
the average equivalent annual rate on a aa corporate bond at december  was 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include  among other items  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
due to the length of the carryforward period it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will expire prior to being utilized 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 

table of contents sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  and our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years 
a valuation allowance may need to be recorded against us deferred tax assets in the event that future us taxable income is materially different than estimated amounts 
the primary risk factor is a more than expected severe downturn in the us automotive and commercial vehicle segments of which the company has significant us operations 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
restructuring 
we have recorded restructuring charges in the recent period in connection with improving manufacturing efficiency and cost position by transferring production to other locations 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with this initiative  we recorded liabilities for severance costs 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
at december   however  all of our debt was fixed rate debt 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to manage this risk 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and the recent increases in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
we manage this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
the recent increases in certain commodity costs have negatively affected our operating results  and a continuation of such price increases could significantly affect our profitability 
we entered into fixed price swap contracts for and metric tonnes of copper in december and january  respectively 
these contracts fixed the cost of copper purchases in and expired on december  in december  we entered into another fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which will last through december the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
going forward  we believe that our mitigation efforts will offset a substantial portion of the financial impact of these increased costs 
however  no assurances can be given that the magnitude or duration of these increased costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in commodity prices would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk our risks related to foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material  however  given the current economic climate  we are more closely monitoring this risk 
we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these investments is to reduce exposure related to the company s british pound denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s foreign currency option contracts expired as of december  we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million as of december  for foreign currency contracts outstanding at december   a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million as of december  it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
