overview at the end of  we operated retail stores  including in new england and five in florida  and for the year we generated approximately million in sales and had net income of approximately million 
total sales for fiscal a week period increased over fiscal also a week period 
comparable store sales in increased over sales in comparable store sales are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year 
this marks our sixth consecutive year of positive comparable store sales growth 
the year began with an increase in comparable store sales in the first quarter of total sales for the first quarter of increased compared to the first quarter of this performance was partly due to the inclusion of approximately  in sales from december  traditionally a strong sales day  which was not included in the first quarter of our comparable store sales were also positively affected by the exit of a significant competitor from our boston market 
in addition  increased sales in our mature stores and in stores opened during contributed to the first quarter comparable store sales results 
the increase in comparable store and total sales allowed us to better leverage our occupancy  marketing and general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of as compared to our first quarter of in the second quarter  comparable stores sales increased compared to the same period in during this quarter  our comparable store sales continued to benefit from the exit of our boston market competitor  as well as from sales gains from our stores opened in and total sales increased in the second quarter of compared to the same period in because of these sales results  we were able to better leverage our occupancy and marketing costs during the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of general and administrative costs during the second quarter increased both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales  largely because of increases in executive recruitment costs and professional fees associated with our compliance activities related to section of the sarbanes oxley act of net income significantly increased to  compared to net income of  in the second quarter of in the third quarter  our comparable stores sales increased by compared to the third quarter of total sales increased compared to third quarter the effect of the exit of our boston competitor  while present  was less in the third quarter than in the first two quarters of the year 
as a result of the increased sales  product and occupancy costs and marketing and sales costs continued to decrease as a percentage of sales compared to the third quarter of our general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of increased as a percentage of sales compared to the third quarter of  mainly due to costs associated with executive recruitment and sarbanes oxley act compliance

comparable store and total company sales for the quarter were negatively affected by several episodes of inclement weather in the new england region  where we predominantly operate  during the month of december  and to a lesser extent by increased temporary halloween store competition in the company s markets during the halloween season 
cost of products sold and occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales during the fourth quarter  partly as a result of additional markdowns taken to avoid excessive inventory levels  and partly because of the decreased leverage on lower sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales during the fourth quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter 
on the other hand  general and administrative expenses decreased both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales  mostly related to a smaller bonus accrual for employees in our support office

in  our provision for income taxes was  which included  for federal alternative minimum taxes and  for state income taxes 
our provision for state taxes was less than the average statutory rate net of federal tax benefit because we were able to use state tax loss carryforwards to reduce state taxes payable 
those state tax loss carryforwards were fully exhausted in and were therefore not available to reduce state taxes payable in we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in  which were fully reserved for in the prior year due to the uncertainty of future taxable income

net income loss our net income in was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share  in critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory our inventory consists of party supplies and is valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
during each interim reporting period  we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly before and after our year end  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
we also make adjustments to reduce the value of our inventory for an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  which is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future sales 
we conduct reviews periodically throughout the year on each stock keeping unit sku 
as we identify obsolete and excess inventory  we take immediate measures to reduce our inventory risk on these items and we adjust our allowance accordingly 
thus  actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of the value of a five year non compete agreement from party city corporation party city and its affiliates that covers massachusetts  maine  new hampshire  vermont  rhode island  and windsor and new london counties in connecticut which expires in this asset has an estimated life of months 
also included is the value related to the retail store lease that we acquired from party city in peabody  massachusetts 
this asset has an estimated life of months  which includes months on the initial term of the store lease plus months on an existing lease renewal option 
also  intangible assets includes legal and other transaction costs incurred before the end of our fiscal year related to the purchase of two party city franchise stores located in rhode island 
the rhode island stores transaction was completed on january   shortly after the period covered by this report 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a review of each store for impairment indicators whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable from estimated future store cash flows 
our review considers store operating results  future sales growth and cash flows 
the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates if underlying assumptions or business strategies change 
on november   we closed our store in east providence  rhode island due to underperforming sales 
as a result of this closing  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to remaining lease payments and other closing costs during the year ended december  the term of the lease expired on august  at december   the accrual has been reduced to zero 
as of december   we planned to close two stores in early january  at the end of their lease terms 
these two stores were closed as planned 
no impairment charges were required for these stores  as the assets related to them have been fully amortized  except for immaterial amounts  and no liability existed for future lease costs 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our remaining stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in determining if a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is appropriate  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence that we considered included we were profitable in and  we have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for the last six years and we had improved merchandise margins in the negative evidence that we considered included we realized a net loss in  our merchandise margins decreased in and  our future profitability is vulnerable to certain risks  including a the risk that we may not be able to generate significant taxable income to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  b the risk of unseasonable weather and other factors in a single geographic region  new england  where our stores are concentrated  c the risk of being so dependent upon a single season  halloween  for a significant amount of annual sales and profitability and d the risk of fluctuating prices for petroleum products  which are a key raw material for much of our merchandise and which affect our freight costs and those of our suppliers and affect our customers spending levels and patterns  the costs that opening or acquiring new stores will put pressure on our profit margins until these stores reach maturity  the expected costs of increased regulatory compliance  including  without limitation  those associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  will likely have a negative impact on our profitability 
the negative evidence is strong enough for us to conclude that the level of our future profitability is uncertain at this time 
we believe that it is prudent for us to maintain a valuation allowance until we have a longer track record of profitability and we can reduce our exposure to the risks described above 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination

the provisions of sfas are effective for the fiscal year beginning after november  or for us the year ending december   and should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is adopted 
in february  the fasb decided to defer the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we will adopt sfas for our fiscal year ending december  we believe that sfas will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  including purchases under our supply agreement with amscan  as described more fully below  occupancy expenses of our stores  employee salaries  and new store openings  including acquisitions 
our primary sources of cash are cash from operating activities  and debt  including our line of credit and notes payable 
our prospective cash flows are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  improve our infrastructure  respond to economic conditions  and meet contractual commitments 
we expect our capital expenditures for to include amounts for asset purchases related to our strategic plans to acquire new stores  as well as amounts related to opening new stores and improving existing stores 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  that anticipated revenues from operations and borrowings available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and working capital requirements through the next twelve months 
in the event that our operating plan changes due to changes in our strategic plans  lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
if so  we would be required to adjust our expenditures in to conserve working capital or raise additional capital  possibly including debt or equity financing  to fund operations and our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance  that  should we seek or require additional financing  such financing will be available  if at all  on terms and conditions acceptable to us  effecting our ability to effectuate our acquisition strategy 
our operating activities used  in compared to providing  in  an increase use of  the additional cash used by operating activities was primarily due to higher purchases of inventory and reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses  as compared to increases in those liabilities in the prior year 
we used  in investing activities in compared to  in the cash invested in was primarily for fixed assets associated with improvements in our existing stores 
the cash invested in was primarily for the acquisition in august of one retail store and a five year non compete agreement with party city 
additional cash invested in was for fixed assets associated with improvements to our existing stores 
if we achieve our acquisition strategy in  we expect to see a further increase in investing activities 
we provided  in cash from financing activities in compared to using  in financing activities in  an increase of  we increased borrowings under our line of credit see below by  in to million compared to a decrease of  in to million 
the borrowings under our line of credit in were higher than primarily due to increased inventory purchases  increased payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses  and the absence of notes payable proceeds 
in  pursuant to our supply agreement with amscan  we elected to convert  of extended payables originally due to amscan as of august  as well as an additional  of payables due to amscan as of september  into a single subordinated promissory note in the total principal amount of we have a line of credit the line with wells fargo retail finance ii  llc  which expires on january  the maximum loan amount available under the line of credit with wells fargo is  which may be increased up to a maximum level of  upon days written notice  as long as we are in compliance with all debt covenants and the other provisions of the loan agreement 
the agreement permits us  at our option  to use the london interbank offered rate libor for certain of our borrowings rather than the bank s base rate 
borrowings under our line of credit are secured by our inventory and accounts receivable 
we borrow against these assets at agreed upon advance rates  which vary at different times of the year 
our inventory consists of party supplies which are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market and are reduced by an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory and other adjustments  including vendor rebates  discounts and freight costs 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against acceptable inventory at cost  which takes our inventory at cost and reflects adjustments that our lender has approved which may be different than adjustments we use for valuing our inventory in our financial statements  such as the adjustment to reserve for inventory shortage 
the amount of acceptable inventory at cost was approximately  at december  our accounts receivable consists primarily of vendor rebates receivables and credit card receivables 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against eligible credit card receivables  which are the credit card receivables for the previous two to three days of business 
the amount of eligible credit card receivables was approximately  at december  our total borrowing base is determined by adding the acceptable inventory at cost times an agreed upon advance rate plus the eligible credit card receivables times an agreed upon advance rate but not to exceed our established credit limit  which was million at december  under the terms of our line of credit  our  credit limit was further reduced by a minimum availability block  customer deposits  gift certificates  merchandise credits and outstanding letters of credit 
therefore  our additional availability was  at december  and  at december  the amounts outstanding under our line were  at december  and  as of december  the outstanding balances under our line are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
our line of credit includes a number of covenants  including a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum availability under the line of of the credit limit 
at december   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
the amended agreement also has a covenant that requires us to limit our capital expenditures to within of those amounts included in our business plan  which may be updated from time to time 
actual capital expenditures for our fiscal year totaled  or of our business plan amount 
on december   wells fargo waived compliance with the capital expenditure covenant for with this waiver  as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our line of credit 
on january   we amended our line to allow for a  term loan  which increased our borrowing base  but was contained within the million credit limit 
the interest rate on the term loan was the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
during the time the term loan remained outstanding  the interest rate on the line of credit was the bank s base rate plus basis points 
the term loan had an amended maturity date of october  we repaid the term loan on march  on august   we amended our agreement with wells fargo to permit us to enter into a supply agreement with amscan and an asset purchase agreement with party city 
the amendment also allows for us to incur the indebtedness represented by the amscan note  defined below  and the party city note  defined below  and to incur other unsecured subordinated indebtedness consented to by wells fargo 
our supply agreement with amscan gives us the right to receive certain additional rebates and more favorable pricing terms over the term of the agreement than generally were available to us under our previous terms with amscan 
the right to receive additional rebates  and the amount of such rebates  are subject to our achievement of increased levels of purchases and other factors provided for in the supply agreement 
in exchange  the supply agreement obligates us to purchase increased levels of merchandise from amscan until the supply agreement provided for a ramp up period during and and  for five years beginning with calendar year  requires us to purchase on an annual basis merchandise equal to the total number of our stores open during such calendar year  multiplied by  the supply agreement provides for penalties in the event we fail to attain the annual purchase commitment that would require us to pay to amscan the difference between the purchases for that year and the annual purchase commitment for that year 
although we do not expect to incur any penalties under this supply agreement  if they were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our uses and sources of cash 
the supply agreement also provided for amscan to extend  until october   approximately  of certain currently due amscan payables owed by us to amscan which would otherwise have been payable by us on august  the extended payables and gave us the right  at our option  to convert the extended payables into a subordinated promissory note 
as discussed above  on october   we elected to convert  of extended payables originally due to amscan as of august  as well as an additional  of payables due to amscan as of september  into a single subordinated promissory note in the total principal amount of  the amscan note 
the amscan note bears interest at the rate of per annum and is payable in thirty six equal monthly installments of principal and interest of  commencing on november   and on the first day of each month thereafter until october   when the entire remaining principal balance and all accrued interest is due and payable 
on august   we also entered into and simultaneously closed an asset purchase agreement with party city  an affiliate of amscan  pursuant to which we acquired a party city retail party goods store in peabody  massachusetts and received a five year non competition covenant from party city  for aggregate consideration of  payable by a subordinated note in the principal amount of  which will bear interest at the rate of per annum the party city note and  in cash 
the party city note is payable by quarterly interest only payments over four years  with the full principal amount due at the note s maturity on august  on september   we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we raised million through a combination of subordinated debt and warrants issued to highbridge international llc highbridge  an institutional accredited investor 
under the terms of the financing  we issued highbridge a three year million subordinated note the highbridge note that bears interest at an interest rate of prime plus one percent 
the highbridge note matures on september  in addition  we issued highbridge a warrant the highbridge warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  or of the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately prior to the closing of the transaction 
we allocated approximately  of value to the highbridge warrant using the black scholes model with volatility of  interest of and expected life of five years 
the highbridge warrant is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the highbridge note 
the agreements entered into in connection with the financing provide for certain restrictions and covenants consistent with highbridge s status as a subordinated lender  and also grant highbridge resale registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the highbridge warrant 
the issuance of the highbridge warrant triggered certain anti dilution provisions of our series b  c  and d convertible preferred stock 
as a result  the outstanding shares of these three series of preferred stock are now convertible into an aggregate of  additional shares of common stock 
the issuance of the highbridge warrant  however  did not trigger the anti dilution provisions of our series e or f convertible preferred stock or any of our other outstanding warrants 
contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period within year within years within years after years total line of credit capital lease obligations notes payable supply agreement operating leases including retail space leases total contractual obligations in addition  at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling approximately  for the acquisition of inventory and non inventory items that were scheduled for delivery after december  acquisitions we operate in a largely un branded market that has many small businesses 
as a result  we have considered  and may continue to consider  growing our business through acquisitions of other entities 
any determination to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction  the business prospects  geographical location and the extent to which any acquisition would enhance our prospects 
on august   we entered into an asset purchase agreement to purchase two franchised party city corporation retail stores in lincoln  rhode island and warwick  rhode island  in exchange for aggregate consideration of  plus up to  for associated inventory 
on january   we completed the purchase of the two stores
