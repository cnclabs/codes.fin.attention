item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc provides a variety of products from its two business segments the furniture segment and the electronic manufacturing services ems segment 
the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  sold under the company s family of brand names 
the ems segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities to a variety of industries globally 
the ems segment  formerly named the electronic contract assemblies segment  was renamed during the first quarter of fiscal year to more accurately reflect the focus of the segment 
there was no financial statement impact from this name change 
management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be most important to understanding the company s financial condition and operating performance globalization continues to reshape not only the industries in which the company operates but also its key customers 
the company is continually assessing its strategies in relation to the instability in the us economic environment and the volatility of the us financial markets 
a portion of the company s office furniture sales are to financial institutions which are being impacted by the credit market issues 
the company is closely monitoring market changes in order to proactively adjust discretionary spending in anticipation of the impact those market changes may have on its sales and operations 
competitive pricing within the ems segment and on select projects within the furniture segment continues to put pressure on the company s operating margins 
increased upward pressure on commodity and fuel prices is expected to be a challenge the company will continue to address in the near term 
the company currently has excess capacity at select operations 
the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma international lowered its projection for growth in the office furniture industry and is currently projecting a year over year decline in the office furniture industry for the remainder of calendar years and the nature of the electronic manufacturing services industry is such that the start up of new programs to replace departing customers or expiring programs occurs frequently  and the new programs often carry lower margins 
the success of the company s ems segment is dependent on the successful replacement of such customers or programs 
such changes usually occur gradually over time as old programs phase out of production while newer programs ramp up 
the company continues its strategy of diversification within the ems segment customer base as it focuses on four key market verticals medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety 
with the company s fiscal year acquisition of reptron electronics  inc reptron  sales to customers in the medical industry are now the largest portion of the company s ems segment with sales to customers in the automotive industry being the second largest 
successful execution of the company s restructuring plans is critical to the company s future performance 
the success of the restructuring initiatives is dependent on accomplishing the plans in a timely and effective manner 
a critical component of the restructuring initiatives is transfer of production among facilities which during fiscal year contributed to some manufacturing inefficiencies and excess working capital 
the company s restructuring plans are discussed in the segment discussions below 
the ems segment s new operation in china started production in june the continued success of this start up operation is critical for securing additional customers and increasing facility utilization 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  the ems segment was impacted by a reduction in the pricing of select raw material which is purchased from a major customer  bayer ag and affiliates 
the selling price of the finished product back to that customer has likewise been reduced by an amount equal to the material price reduction 
fiscal year had a full year impact of this pricing reduction while fiscal year only had the impact for half of the year and thus resulted in a million net sales reduction in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year gross profit dollars were not impacted  but the consolidated fiscal year to date gross profit as a percent of net sales measure increased approximately percentage point as a result of this pricing change compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percent of net sales increased by a similar percentage 
there was no impact to net income and net cash flows 
the company continues to have a strong balance sheet which includes a net cash position from an aggregate of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  less short term borrowings under credit facilities totaling million at june  the increasingly competitive marketplace mandates that the company continually re evaluate its business models 
the regulatory and business environment for us public companies requires that the company continually evaluate and enhance its practices in the areas of corporate governance and management practices 
the company s employees throughout its business operations are an integral part of the company s ability to compete successfully  and the stability of its management team is critical to long term share owner value 
to address these and other trends and events  the company has taken  or continues to consider and take  the following actions as end markets dictate  the company is continually assessing excess capacity and developing plans to better utilize manufacturing operations  including shifting manufacturing capacity to lower cost venues as necessary 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a plan to expand its european automotive electronics capabilities and to establish a european medical center of expertise in poznan  poland 
the company presently has an operation in poznan 
as part of the plan  the company will consolidate its ems facilities located in longford  ireland  bridgend  wales  and poznan into a new  larger facility in poznan 
in fiscal year  the company also completed the consolidation of us manufacturing facilities within the ems segment due to excess capacity resulting in the exit of two facilities 
these activities are discussed in more detail in the fiscal year ems segment discussion below 
as part of the company s diversification plan for the ems segment  during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired reptron 
this acquisition is discussed in more detail in the fiscal year ems segment discussion below 
the company exited the manufacture of contract private label products to further sharpen its focus on primary markets in the furniture segment 
as part of this planned exit  during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company exited the production of wood rear projection television ptv cabinets and stands resulting in the closure of the company s juarez  mexico  manufacturing facility 
the company has taken a number of steps to conform its corporate governance to evolving national and industry wide best practices among us public companies  not only to comply with new legal requirements  but also to enhance the decision making process of the board of directors 
the preceding statements could be considered forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  a significant change in economic conditions  loss of key customers or suppliers  or similar unforeseen events 
discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a plan to exit the production of ptv cabinets and stands within the furniture segment  which resulted in the exit of the company s juarez  mexico  operation 
production ceased at the juarez facility during the second quarter of fiscal year  and all inventory has been sold 
miscellaneous wrap up activities including disposition of remaining equipment were complete as of june  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company bought out the remaining term of the building lease 
as a result of ceasing operations at this facility  the financial results associated with the mexican operations in the furniture segment were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the quarter ended december   and all prior periods were restated 
during fiscal year  the company sold a forest products hardwood lumber business unit  a business unit which produced and sold fixed wall furniture systems  and an operation that manufactured polyurethane and polyester molded components 
all three business units were part of the furniture segment 
the cessation of these non core operations did not impact any of the remaining operations of the company 
the results of the above mentioned operations are reported as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements 
see 
note discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the discontinued operations

cook  president of indiana hardwoods  inc was formerly employed by the company as a vice president of kimball international  inc and had responsibility for this hardwoods lumber operation 
the transaction prices were negotiated between the company and indiana hardwoods  inc the company also considered offers from other interested outside parties  but determined that it was in the company s best interest financially to sell this operation to indiana hardwoods  inc the purchase price totaled million  of which million was collected at closing and million was a note receivable 
the company recorded an allowance on this note receivable at the time of sale since there was uncertainty as to whether the entire balance was collectable 
in fiscal year  million of expense was recorded as an additional allowance for this receivable and final payment was received for the net amount 
the company has no ongoing commitments resulting from the sales agreement 
fiscal year results of operations the following discussions are based on income from continuing operations and therefore exclude all income statement activity of the discontinued operations 
financial overview consolidated fiscal year consolidated net sales were billion compared to fiscal year net sales of billion  a increase over fiscal year the higher net sales resulted from increased ems segment net sales related to the third quarter fiscal year reptron acquisition within the ems segment which contributed net sales of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as well as increased organic furniture and ems segment net sales 
in addition  in mid fiscal year  the company reduced the price of finished product sold to a customer in the ems segment which carried forward through fiscal year fiscal year had a full year impact of this pricing reduction while fiscal year only had the impact for half of the year and thus resulted in a million net sales reduction in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  which partially offset the ems sales increase 
the company recorded income from continuing operations for fiscal year of million  or less than per class b diluted share  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million  or per class b diluted share 
the fiscal year restructuring charges were primarily related to the european consolidation plan  a workforce reduction plan  and the exit of two domestic ems facilities 
fiscal year income from continuing operations was million  or per class b diluted share  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million  or per class b diluted share 
information regarding the acquisition and restructurings is included in the segment discussions below 
consolidated gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year both the ems segment and the furniture segment contributed to the decline as discussed in more detail in the segment discussions below 
gross profit was also negatively impacted as the company s sales mix continued to shift toward the ems segment  which operates at a lower gross profit percentage than the furniture segment 
partially offsetting the fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales decline  the ems customer pricing adjustment discussed above increased gross margin as a percent of net sales approximately percentage point compared to fiscal year gross margin 
this ems customer pricing adjustment had no impact on the gross margin dollars for either fiscal year or fiscal year as the reduction in sales was offset by an equal reduction in material cost purchased from the same customer 
the fiscal year consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expense level in absolute dollars approximated the fiscal year level and declined as a percent of net sales 
the decline in consolidated sg a costs as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the leverage of the higher net sales level and the shift in sales mix toward the ems segment  which has a lower sg a percentage than the furniture segment 
fiscal year other income totaled million compared to fiscal year other income of million 
fiscal year interest expense was million higher due to higher average outstanding debt balances  and fiscal year interest income was million lower than fiscal year as the company s average cash and short term investment balances were lower 
in addition  a million decline in the market value of the company s supplemental employee retirement plan serp investments for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year contributed to the decline in other income 
the loss on the serp investment that was recognized in other income was exactly offset by a reduction in the serp liability which was recognized in sg a expense in accordance with us gaap 
fiscal year other income also included million pre tax income relating to funds received as part of a polish offset credit program for investments made in the company s poland operation 
as a result of various tax benefits in fiscal year  such as tax exempt interest income and the research and development credit  coupled with the tax benefit recorded related to the pre tax loss  the company recorded an overall income tax benefit greater than the pre tax loss 
the fiscal year effective tax rate was 
for further detail see 
note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparing the balance sheets as of june  to june   the decline in the company s cash and short term investment balances was primarily a result of the company repurchasing million class b shares during fiscal year under a previously authorized share repurchase program 
the company s inventory balance has increased since june  primarily in support of the transfer of production related to the consolidation of facilities 
the company s accounts payable balance increased since june  due to an agreement with select customers from which the company also purchases materials that allows the company to extend accounts payable terms if those customers extend the timeframe in which they pay the company 
the company s accounts receivable balance thus likewise increased  but to a lesser extent due to offsetting declines in accounts receivable elsewhere in the company 
the company s borrowings under credit facilities increased as the company opted to borrow to fund short term cash needs rather than sell debt securities in its investment portfolio which have favorable yields

first  in january  bayer ag sold its diagnostics unit to siemens ag  and thus a portion of the company s net sales which were formerly to bayer ag affiliates in fiscal year are now to siemens ag 
second  net sales to bayer ag affiliates were also impacted as a result of the company s aforementioned selling price reduction effective january to bayer ag affiliates which was offset by an equal reduction in the material cost 
the company also continues to focus on diversification of the ems segment customer base

new business awards for projects in the automotive industry are extremely competitive 
risk factors within this segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  increased globalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  rapid technological changes  component availability  the contract nature of this industry  unexpected integration issues with acquisitions  and the importance of sales to large customers
