critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  ari assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar 
table of contents leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
sfas no 
requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities  ari accounts for our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting because the company exercises significant influence over  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the company s balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  ari s net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture 
table of contents agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  ari s recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  the company consolidates those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
recognition of rental income rental income for commercial property leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
in accordance with sfas  we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
on our consolidated balance sheets  we include as a receivable the excess of rental income recognized over rental payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual commercial lease agreements 
reimbursements of operating costs  as allowed under most of our commercial tenant leases  consist of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  and are recognized as revenue in the period in which the recoverable expenses are incurred 
we record these reimbursements on a gross basis  since we generally are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have the credit risk with respect to paying the supplier 
rental income for residential property leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis as lease terms are generally for periods of one year or less 
for hotel properties  revenues for room sales and guest services are recognized as rooms are occupied and services are rendered 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all past due rents and operating expense reimbursements considered to be uncollectible 
revenue recognition on the sale of real estate sales of real estate are recognized when and to the extent permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
until the requirements of sfas no 
for full profit recognition have been met  transactions are accounted for using the deposit  installment  cost recovery or financing method  whichever is appropriate 
when ari provides seller financing  gain is not recognized at the time of sale unless the buyer s initial investment and continuing investment are deemed to be adequate as determined by sfas guidelines 
non performing notes receivable ari considers a note receivable to be non performing when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments 
any new note receivable that results from a modification or extension of a note considered non performing will also be considered non performing  without regard to the borrower s adherence to payment terms 
interest recognition on notes receivable interest income is not recognized on notes receivable that have been delinquent for days or more 
in addition  accrued but unpaid interest income is only recognized to the extent that the net realizable value of the underlying collateral exceeds the carrying value of the receivable 

table of contents allowance for estimated losses a valuation allowance is provided for estimated losses on notes receivable considered to be impaired 
impairment is considered to exist when it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
valuation allowances are provided for estimated losses on notes receivable to the extent that the investment in the note exceeds management s estimate of fair value of the collateral securing such note 
fair value of financial instruments the following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of ari s notes receivable  marketable equity securities and notes payable 
for performing notes receivable  the fair value was estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar loans 
for non performing notes receivable  the estimated fair value of ari s interest in the collateral property was used 
for marketable equity securities  fair value was based on the year end closing market price of each security 
for notes payable  the fair value was estimated using current rates for mortgages with similar terms and maturities results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and at december    and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio the total property portfolio of   and income producing properties  respectively
