in addition  we sell branded sunglass and goggle accessories 
in managing our business  we are particularly focused on ensuring that our product designs are keyed to current trends in the fashion industry  incorporate the most advanced technologies to enhance performance and provide value to our target market 
we began as a grassroots brand in southern california and entered the action sports and youth lifestyle markets with innovative and performance driven products and an authentic connection to the action sports and youth lifestyle markets under the spy optic brand 
we have two wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated in italy  spy optic  srl and lem our primary manufacturer which we acquired on january   and a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in california  spy optic  inc  which we consolidate in our financial statements 
we were incorporated as sports colors  inc in california in august from august to april  we had no operations 
in april  we changed our name to spy optic  inc in november  we reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to orange inc results of operations years ended december  and net sales consolidated net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is partly due to increased sales and marketing efforts  including an increase in sales force  and an improvement in product mix 
domestic net sales represented and of total net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
foreign net sales represented and of total net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the sales mix on a dollar basis for the years ended december  and was and  respectively  for eyewear and and  respectively  for apparel and accessories 
cost of sales and gross profit our consolidated gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales is partly due to efficiencies achieved at lem  our subsidiary and primary manufacturer  and a more favorable product mix 
the increase is also due to net decreases in inventory reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory that is no longer being marketed for resale of approximately of million 
during the year ended december   inventory with an adjusted basis of million was sold for approximately million in revenue  affecting margins by million or of net sales 
the remaining decrease in the inventory reserve was mainly due to the disposal of product which has no effect on the results of operations 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million write off of point of purchase displays in the us  which was a result of transferring ownership of the point of purchase displays to our customers during june in addition  in the us  further purchases of point of purchase displays will no longer be capitalized since the displays will be owned by the customers 
the cost of these displays will be charged to sales and marketing expense 
we do not expect this change to materially affect our results of operations in future periods 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased legal fees of million which included million in legal fees related to negotiations for the acquisition of the retail stores division of no fear which did not materialize  a million increase for employee related compensation expense at lem including severance pay for lem employees and related legal fees  increased consulting fees of million  increased share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r of million  and increases in depreciation and amortization costs and rent expense 
the increases were partly offset by decreases in audit fees of million  bad debt expense of million  million payroll costs in the us  investor relations related costs  travel and business insurance 
shipping and warehousing expense shipping and warehousing expense consists primarily of wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs  packaging supplies  third party warehousing and third party fulfillment costs  facility costs and utilities 
shipping and warehousing expense remained consistent at million for each of the years ended december  and research and development expense research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is mainly due to an increase in employee related compensation expense 
other net expense other net expense was million for the year ended december  compared to other net expense of million for the year ended december  the change in other net expense is primarily due to increases in net interest expense partly offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in compared to foreign currency losses in income tax benefit provision the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million compared to a million benefit for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a larger proportion of the pretax losses incurred in the us versus in italy  offset by the valuation allowance of million recorded in the us booked in versus no valuation allowance recorded in for the us net loss a net loss of million was incurred for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow activities cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  provision for bad debts  stock compensation expense and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which consisted of a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of approximately million and million used in working capital and other activities 
working capital and other activities includes a million increase in net inventory due primarily to an increase in inventory in anticipation of future sales and a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of invoices received and payments made offset partly and a million decrease in income tax receivable and a million decrease in prepaid and other current assets 
cash provided for by operating activities for the year ended december  was million which consisted of a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of approximately million  and million provided for by working capital and other activities 
working capital and other activities consisted primarily of a million decrease in inventory due to an increase in sales and inventory reserves due to slow and obsolete inventory which we no longer market for resale  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments of vendor invoices and an offsetting million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of customer receipts 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million and was primarily attributable to the purchase of million of fixed assets  including retail point of purchase displays 
going forward  point of purchase displays in the us will be expensed as a sales and marketing expense 
we also made million in payments related to requirements of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of lem that were paid out during the year 
we had an offset of approximately million due to net proceeds received on short term investments 
additionally  we released million of restricted cash related to collateralization of our financing arrangements of million and million that was held in escrow related to the acquisition of lem 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million and was primarily attributable to the purchase of million of fixed assets  including our new enterprise resource planning system and retail point of purchase displays and million for the purchase of lem  our primary manufacturer 
additionally  we made a investment in restricted cash of which million is related to requirements of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of lem and million is related to collateralization of our financing arrangements with comerica bank 
we had an offset of approximately million due to net proceeds received on short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was mainly attributable to million in net proceeds received through our lines of credit and million in net proceeds received through the issuance of notes payable  partially offset by million for notes payable and capital lease principal payments 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was mainly attributable to million in net proceeds received through our line of credit facilities and million received through the issuance of notes payable  partially offset by million for capital lease principal payments 
credit facilities at december   we had financing arrangements with comerica bank consisting of a line of credit facility with a million limit  a foreign exchange facility and letter of credit accommodations 
these 
table of contents arrangements were secured by all our assets  excluding our intellectual property  and a million collateral cash deposit with comerica  and were subject to certain covenants  including several liquidity  debt coverage and minimum equity ratios 
the million available line of credit was reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit sub limit of million and of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts million sub limit 
borrowings were limited to cover any outstanding letters of credit issued to san paolo imi on behalf of lem million euros or million at december  
our foreign exchange facility allowed us to purchase currency contracts which we used primarily to hedge our foreign currency exposure 
the amount of allowable purchases of such contracts was million 
at december   net foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding amounted to million  which reduced the amount available to us under the line of credit by  as a result  at december   we had an unused line of credit of approximately million with comerica bank 
at december   we were not in compliance with two financial covenants under the financing arrangements with comerica related to maintaining a minimum tangible net worth and not incurring net losses in two consecutive quarters 
on february   we amended our financing arrangements with comerica  which decreased our letter of credit sub limit to million  decreased our foreign exchange facility limit from million to million and extended the expiration date to may  we later replaced this line of credit with a line of credit from bfi business finance on february   as described below 
on february   spy optic  inc entered into a loan and security agreement loan agreement with bfi business finance bfi with a maximum borrowing capacity of million  which was subsequently modified to extend the maximum borrowing capacity to million and to affect certain other changes 
actual borrowing availability under the loan agreement is based on eligible trade receivable and inventory levels of spy optic  inc loans extended pursuant to the loan agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as reported in the western edition of the wall street journal from time to time plus  with a minimum monthly interest charge of  we granted bfi a security interest in all of spy optic  inc s assets as security for its obligations under the loan agreement  except for its copyrights  patents  trademarks  servicemarks and related applications 
additionally  the obligations under the loan agreement are guaranteed by orange inc the loan agreement imposes certain covenants on spy optic  inc  including  but not limited to  covenants requiring it to provide certain periodic reports to bfi  inform bfi of certain changes in the business  refrain from incurring additional debt in excess of  and refrain from paying dividends 
spy optic  inc also established a bank account in bfi s name into which collections on accounts receivable and other collateral are deposited the collateral account 
pursuant to the deposit control account agreement between spy optic  inc and bfi with respect to the collateral account  bfi is entitled to sweep all amounts deposited into the collateral account and apply the funds to outstanding obligations under the loan agreement  provided that bfi is required to distribute to spy optic  inc any amounts remaining after payment of all amounts due under the loan agreement 
to secure its obligations under the guaranty  orange inc granted bfi a blanket security interest in all of its assets  except for its stock in spy optic  inc  which it has covenanted not to pledge to any other person or entity 
we were in compliance with the covenants at december  we received a loan in the amount of  upon the execution of the loan agreement 
these proceeds were used to fully collateralize comerica bank for the letter of credit issued by comerica on behalf of orange inc and lem to san paolo imi in the amount of million euros 
the letter of credit with comerica expired in may the collateral of million euros was transferred to an interest bearing account with san paolo imi in italy to serve as collateral for the lem san paolo imi line of credit 
during september san paolo released the collateral requirement in conjunction with the reduction of the san paolo imi line of credit 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the loan agreement  bearing an interest rate of and availability under this line of million subject to eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 

table of contents at december   we also had a million euros line of credit in italy with san paolo imi for lem 
during october the line of credit was reduced to million euros 
borrowing availability is based on eligible accounts receivable and export orders received at lem 
at december   there was approximately million euros available under this line of credit 
at december  and  amounts outstanding under this line of credit amounted to million and million  respectively 
the interest rate at december  was 
if we are able to achieve anticipated net sales  manage our inventory and manage operating expenses  we believe that our cash on hand and available loan facilities will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating requirements for at least the next months 
otherwise  changes in operating plans  lower than anticipated net sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item a  risk factors  may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of net sales growth  continuing financing requirements related to our recent acquisition of lem  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the continuing market acceptance of our product designs 
we may be required to seek equity or debt financing in the future  which would result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december  and  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at december  and income taxes in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the level of historical operating results and projections for the taxable income for the future  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  will be realized in the us at december  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance for our us operations at december  and of  and  respectively 
at december  and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our wholly owned subsidiaries  spy optic  srl and lem 
backlog historically  purchases of sunglass and motocross eyewear products have not involved significant pre booking activity 
purchases of our snow goggle products are generally pre booked and shipped primarily from august to october 
we experienced delays in manufacturing and shipping our sunglass and goggle products during and these delays have materially affected our results of operations 
we anticipate that we may continue to experience manufacturing and shipping delays  and that such delays may continue to have a material effect on our results of operations 
seasonality our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our products 
historically  we have experienced greater net sales in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of our products and the markets in which we sell our products 
we generally sell more of our 
table of contents sunglass products in the first half of the fiscal year and a majority of our goggle products in the last half of the fiscal year 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales will continue 
as a result  our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
inflation we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our operations in the past  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  sales returns  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances  share based compensation  impairment testing and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily generated through sales of sunglasses  goggles and apparel  net of returns and discounts 
revenue is recognized in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
under sab  revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met upon delivery to our carrier  which is also when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers after performing credit evaluations and do not require collateral 
our payment terms generally range from net to net  depending on the country or whether we sell directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor 
our distributors are typically set up as prepay accounts  however credit may be extended to certain distributors  usually upon receipt of a letter of credit 
generally  our sales agreements with our customers  including distributors  do not provide for any rights of return or price protection 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis in our sole discretion 
we record an allowance for estimated returns when revenues are recorded 
the allowance is calculated using historical evidence of actual returns 
historically  actual returns have been within our expectations 
if future returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable  reserve for refunds and returns and allowance for doubtful accounts throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit 
we reserve for estimated future refunds and returns at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we adjust reserves as we consider necessary 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for anticipated bad debts and refunds 
provisions are made based upon a review of all significant outstanding invoices and overall quality and age of 
table of contents those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze collection experience  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the data used to calculate these allowances does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  an adjustment in the reserve for refunds may be required 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties experienced by our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
share based compensation expense we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the use of accounting principles board apb opinion and the option for pro forma disclosure in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

determining fair value under sfas no 
r valuation and amortization method 
consistent with the valuation method used for the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 we are using the black scholes option pricing valuation model single option approach to calculate the fair value of stock option grants 
for options with graded vesting  the option grant is treated as a single award and compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
expected term 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding 
we estimate the expected term of the option grants based on historical exercise patterns that we believe to be representative of future behavior as well as other various factors 
expected volatility 
we estimate our volatility using our historical share price performance over the expected life of the options  which management believes is materially indicative of expectations about expected future volatility 
risk free interest rate 
we use risk free interest rates in the black scholes option valuation model that are based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
dividend rate 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent reporting periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas no 
for periods prior to the date of adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r related to forfeitures was not material to our financial statements 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished products  including sunglasses  goggles  apparel and accessories  product components such as replacement lenses and purchasing and quality control 
table of contents costs 
inventory items are carried on the books at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method for lem and first in first out method for our distribution business 
periodic physical counts of inventory items are conducted to help verify the balance of inventory 
a reserve is maintained for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
products are reserved at certain percentages based on their probability of selling  which is estimated based on current and estimated future customer demands and market conditions 
historically  there has been variability in the amount of write offs  compared to estimated reserves 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual experience if future economic conditions  levels of consumer demand  customer inventory or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but instead is measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that a likely impairment exists 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the present value of estimated future cash flows uses our estimates of profit for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates and assumed market segment share  and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying business 
under the market approach  fair value is estimated based on market multiples of earnings for comparable companies and similar transactions 
we performed our annual test of goodwill as of october   which did not indicate any impairment and thus the second step was not performed 
determining fair value under the first step of the goodwill impairment test is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the extent of such charge 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we capitalize product molds and tooling and depreciate these costs over the useful life of the asset 
income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed at each balance sheet date for temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing our net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our management s judgment 
if we subsequently determine that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction where we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized 
in the event that actual results 
table of contents differ from our forecasts or we adjust the forecast or assumptions in the future  the change in the valuation allowance could have a significant impact on future income tax expense 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are calculations and transactions  including transfer pricing  where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could materially affect the income tax provision 
foreign currency and derivative instruments the functional currency of each of our foreign wholly owned subsidiaries  spy optic  srl  lem and our canadian division is the respective local currency 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we designate our derivatives based upon the criteria established by sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas  sfas no 
and sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s fair value gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
any realized gain or loss on such derivative is reported in cost of goods sold in the accounting period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the fair value gain or loss from the ineffective portion of the derivative is reported in other income expense immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized at the end of each accounting period in other income expense 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into operating leases  primarily for facilities  and have commitments under endorsement contracts with selected athletes and others who endorse our products 
we also have an agreement with our primary product designer 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the provisions of fin  which prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
there has been no material effect on our financial statements as a result of the adoption of fin as of december  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 

table of contents in february  the fasb released sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the financial statements 
sfas no 
will need to be adopted in order to adopt sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  replacing sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
 broadens its scope by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses  and requires  among other things  that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date  that liabilities related to contingent consideration be recognized at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period  that acquisition related costs be expensed as incurred  and that income be recognized if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred 
sfas no 
r is to be applied prospectively in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
