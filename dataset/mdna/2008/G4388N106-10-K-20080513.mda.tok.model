large sophisticated customers may take actions that adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations 
in recent years  we have observed a consumer trend away from traditional grocery and drug store channels and toward mass merchandisers  which include super centers and club stores 
this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of these mass merchandisers 
as these mass merchandisers grow larger and become more sophisticated  they may demand lower pricing  special packaging  or impose other requirements on product suppliers 
these business demands may relate to inventory practices  logistics  or other aspects of the customer supplier relationship 
if we do not effectively respond to the demands of these mass merchandisers  they could decrease their purchases from us 
a reduction in the demand of our products by these mass merchandisers and the costs of complying with customer business demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we are dependent on third party manufacturers  most of which are located in the far east  and any inability to obtain products from such manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated companies  most of which are in the far east  principally in china 
this exposes us to risks associated with doing business globally  including changing international political relations  labor availability and cost  changes in laws  including tax laws  regulations and treaties  changes in labor laws  regulations  and policies  changes in customs duties and other trade barriers  changes in shipping costs  currency exchange fluctuations  local political unrest  an extended and complex transportation cycle  and the availability and cost of raw materials and merchandise 
the political  legal and cultural environment in the far east is rapidly evolving  and any change that impairs our ability to obtain products from such manufacturers  or to obtain products at marketable rates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have relationships with over third party manufacturers 
during fiscal  the top two manufacturers fulfilled approximately percent of our product requirements 
over the same period  our top five suppliers fulfilled approximately percent of our product requirements 
with most of our manufacturers located in the far east  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately  we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories 
we may also find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  labor in china has been readily available at relatively low cost as compared to labor costs in north america 
china has experienced rapid social  political and economic change in recent years 
there is no assurance that labor will continue to be available in china at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on product costs in china 
labor shortages in china could result in supply delays and disruptions and drive a substantial increase in labor costs 
similarly  evolving government labor regulations and associated compliance standards could cause our product costs to rise or could cause manufacturing partners we rely on to exit the business 
this could have an adverse impact on product availability and quality 
the chinese economy has experienced rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation 
higher general inflation rates will require manufacturers to continue to seek increased product prices 
during fiscal  the chinese renminbi appreciated approximately percent with respect to the us dollar 
to the extent the renminbi continues to appreciate with respect to the us dollar  the company may experience cost increases on such purchases  and this could adversely impact profitability 
the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases 
although china currently enjoys most favored nation trading status with the us  the us government has in the past proposed to revoke such status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from china 
there is no assurance that our business will not be affected by any of the aforementioned risks  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
high costs of raw materials and energy may result in increased cost of sales and certain operating expenses and adversely effect our results of operations and cash flow 
significant variations in the costs and availability of raw materials and energy may negatively affect our results of operations 
our vendors purchase significant amounts of metals and plastics to manufacture our products 
they also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in their production processes 
the rising cost of fuel may also increase our transportation costs 
the cost of these raw materials and energy  in the aggregate  represents a significant portion of our cost of sales and certain operating expenses 
our results of operations have been and could in the future be adversely affected by increases in these costs 
we have had some success in implementing price increases or passing on cost increases by moving customers to newer product models with enhancements that justify higher prices and we intend to continue these efforts 
we can make no assurances that these efforts will be successful in the future or will materially offset the cost increases we may incur 

table of contents we hold certain auction rate securities that we may be unable to liquidate at their recorded values or at all due to credit concerns in the us capital markets 
protracted illiquidity and any deterioration in the credit ratings of the issuers  dealers or credit insurers may require us to reclassify these holdings at some point to long term assets and record impairment charges 
for further information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
at february   all of our temporary investments were auction rate notes collateralized by student loans  which had a carrying value of  liquidity for these securities is normally dependent on an auction process that provides an opportunity to sell the security and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  ranging from to days 
an auction fails when there is insufficient demand 
however  this does not represent a default by the issuer of the security 
upon an auction failure  the interest rates reset based on a formula contained in the security  and this rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
recent credit concerns in the capital markets have significantly reduced our ability to liquidate our auction rate securities 
at this time  there is a very limited demand for these securities and limited acceptable alternatives to liquidate such securities 
based on current market conditions  we believe it is likely that auctions of our holdings in these securities will be unsuccessful in the near term  resulting in us continuing to hold securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
management intends to reduce our holdings in these securities as circumstances allow  but believes we have sufficient liquidity from operating cash flows and available financial sources  including our revolving credit facility  which we believe will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our foreseeable short and long term liquidity requirements 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  based on the related information currently at hand  we do not believe that any of our holdings of these securities are impaired 
if the issuers and brokers are unable to successfully close future auctions  and their credit ratings deteriorate or the credit ratings of the credit insurers deteriorate  the company may be required to reclassify its holdings in these securities to long term assets and to record an impairment charge on these investments in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to record significant impairment charges 
a substantial portion of our long term assets consist of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions 
under generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of the company s assets and require impairment charges 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions to exit a business made in response to changes in economic  political and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or our internal expectations with regard to future revenue growth and the assumptions we make when performing our annual impairment reviews 
as a result of such circumstances  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is determined 
any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
for further information  including estimated impairment charges expected in the first quarter of fiscal  see results of operations under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we materially rely on licensed trademarks  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we are materially dependent on our licensed trademarks as a substantial portion of our sales revenue comes from selling products under licensed trademarks 
as a result  we are materially dependent upon the continued use of such trademarks  particularly the vidal sassoon and revlon trademarks 
actions taken by licensors and other third parties could diminish greatly the value of any of our licensed trademarks 
if we were unable to sell products under these licensed trademarks or the value of the trademarks were diminished by the licensor due to any inability to perform under the terms of the agreements or other reasons  or due to the actions of third parties  the effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could be both negative and material 

table of contents we are subject to risks related to our dependence on the strength of retail economies 
our business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world  primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe  latin america and the far east 
these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry  which  in turn  are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters  terrorist attacks and political unrest 
the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict  and one or more of the factors could adversely impact our business 
in recent years  the retail industry in the us and  increasingly  elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition among retailers 
because such competition  particularly in weak retail economies  can cause retailers to struggle or fail  we must continuously monitor  and adapt to changes in  the profitability  creditworthiness and pricing policies of our customers 
a significant weakening of retail economies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to compete successfully  we must continually develop and introduce innovative new products to meet changing consumer preferences 
our long term success in the competitive retail environment depends on our ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that meet changing consumer preferences and take advantage of opportunities sooner 
we face the risk that our competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with our products 
our core initiatives include fostering our culture of innovation and new product development  enhancing and extending our existing product categories and developing new allied product categories 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 
if we are unable to develop and introduce a continuing stream of new products  it may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated or we may not be able to identify suitable new acquisition opportunities  which may constrain our prospects for future growth and profitability and adversely affect the price of our common shares 
we are constantly looking for opportunities to make complementary strategic business and or brand acquisitions 
these acquisitions  if not favorably received by consumers  shareholders  analysts  and others in the investment community  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
in addition  any acquisition involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel associated with the acquisitions  difficulties in integrating distribution channels  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in transitioning and preserving customer  contractor  supplier and other important third party relationships  difficulties realizing anticipated cost savings  synergies and other benefits related to an acquisition  risks associated with subsequent operating asset write offs  contingent liabilities  and impairment of related acquired intangible assets  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited experience  and potential loss of key employees associated with the acquisitions 

table of contents any difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have incurred debt to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  which could have an adverse impact on our business and profitability 
as a result of our debt obligations  we are operating under substantially more leverage and higher interest costs 
our debt has added constraints on our ability to operate our business  including but not limited to our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes  or other purposes could be limited  an increased portion of our cash flow from operations will be required to service our debt  which will reduce the funds available to us for our operations  a significant portion of our debt is fixed or effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swaps and these rates may produce higher interest expense than would be available with floating rate debt  in the event of decreases in market interest rates  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and conditions in the industries in which we operate  and our debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
significant restrictive covenants include limitations on  among other things  our ability under certain circumstances to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur certain types of liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  enter into substantial new lines of business  and enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates 
we rely on our central global enterprise resource planning systems and other peripheral information systems 
interruptions in the operation of our computerized systems or other information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we conduct most of our businesses under one integrated global enterprise resource planning system  which we implemented in september most of our operations are dependent on this system 
any failures or disruptions in this system could cause considerable disruptions to our business and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we remain in the process of transitioning our mexican operations to our global information system 
this transition has experienced delays as a result of the refocus of our priorities and internal resources on the integration of the belson products business  a project which was completed in fiscal as a result  the transition by our mexican operations to our global information system is currently not expected to be substantially complete until later in fiscal we continuously make adjustments to improve the effectiveness of our systems 
complications resulting from such adjustments could potentially cause considerable disruptions to our business 
application program bugs  system 
table of contents conflict crashes  user error  data integrity issues  customer data conflicts and related integration issues all pose significant risks 
to support new technologies  we continue to support a growing technology infrastructure base 
increased computing capacity  power requirements  back up capacities  broadband network infrastructure and increased security needs are all potential areas for disruption or failure 
we rely on certain outside vendors to assist us with implementation and enhancements and other vendors to assist us in maintaining some of our infrastructure 
should any of these vendors fail to perform as expected  it could adversely affect our service levels and threaten our ability to conduct business 
natural disasters or other extraordinary events may disrupt our information systems and other infrastructure  and our data recovery processes may not be sufficient to protect against loss 
any interruption or loss of data in our information or logistical systems could materially impact our ability to procure our products from our factories and suppliers  transport them to our distribution centers  and store and deliver them to our customers on time and in the correct amounts 
these and other factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a breach of our computer security systems  and unauthorized intrusion could subject us to fraudulent use of sensitive information and or damage to critical data and systems 
such activity could subject us to litigation and various other claims and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the reputation of our business 
information systems require constant updates to their security policies and hardware systems to reduce the risk of unauthorized access  malicious destruction of data  or information theft 
we believe we have taken steps designed to strengthen the security of our computer systems and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program to continue to do so 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data compromise 
we rely on commercially available systems  software  tools and monitoring to provide security for processing  transmission and storage of confidential information 
improper activities by third parties  advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology  new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems 
any such compromises or breach could cause interruptions in our operations and might require us to spend significant management time and money investigating the event and dealing with local and federal law enforcement 
in addition  we could become the subject of litigation and various claims from our customers  employees  suppliers  service providers and shareholders 
regardless of the merits and ultimate outcome of these matters  litigation and proceedings of this type are expensive to respond to and defend  and we could devote substantial resources and time to responding to and defending them 
the ultimate resolution of any such litigation  claims and investigations could cause damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and reputation 
audits and related disputes with taxing authorities  tax compliance and the impact of changes in tax law could have an adverse impact on our business 
we are involved in a tax audits and related disputes with various taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that we have complied with all applicable reporting and tax payment obligations and disagree with taxing authority positions on these various issues 
we are vigorously defending our tax positions through all available administrative and judicial avenues 
for more information about tax audits and related disputes  see item legal proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
although the final resolution of these disputes is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  we have established reserves for our best estimate of the probable tax liability for these matters 
the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than the reserves established for these matters 
an unfavorable resolution on any matter could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents the future impact of tax legislation  regulations or treaties  including any future legislation in the us or abroad that would effect the companies or subsidiaries that comprise our consolidated group is always uncertain 
our ability to respond to such changes so that we maintain favorable tax treatment  the cost and complexity of such compliance  and its impact on our ability to effectively operate in jurisdictions always presents a risk 
favorable tax treatment of our non us earnings is dependent on our ability to avoid classification as a controlled foreign corporation 
changes in the composition of our shareholdings could have an impact on our classification 
if our classification were to change  it could have a material adverse effect on the largest us shareholders and  in turn on the company s business 
a non us corporation  such as ours  will constitute a controlled foreign corporation or cfc for us federal income tax purposes if its largest us shareholders us  those owning percent or more of its shares together own more than percent of the shares outstanding 
if the irs or a court determined that we were a cfc  then each of our us shareholders who own directly  indirectly  or constructively percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock on the last day of our taxable year would be required to include in gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our subpart f income and the subpart f income of any our subsidiaries determined to be a cfc for the period during which we and our non us subsidiaries were a cfc 
in addition  any gain on the sale of our shares realized by such a shareholder may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s proportionate share of our and our cfc subsidiaries undistributed earnings and profits accumulated during the shareholder s holding period of the shares while we are a cfc
