other factors we continue to seek to expand and diversify the types of licensed products being produced under our various brands  as well as diversify the distribution channels within which licensed products are sold  in an effort to reduce dependence on any particular retailer  consumer or market sector 
the success of our company  however  will still remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain brand awareness and contract with and retain key licensees and on our licensees ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular retail channels within the global marketplace 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the us economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  and other factors noted in item a risk factors  could adversely affect our licensees ability to meet and or exceed their contractual commitments to us and thereby adversely affect our future operating results

new accounting standards during fiscal  the company adopted certain new accounting standards issued by the fasb  as described below and summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in fiscal in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are evaluating the impact adopting sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial asset and financial liability including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the standard permits all entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  we are evaluating the impact adopting sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which requires an acquirer to do the following expense acquisition related costs as incurred  to record contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes in fair value to be recognized in the income statement  and any adjustments to the purchase price allocation are to be recognized as a period cost in the income statement 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier application is prohibited 
at the date of adoption  sfas r is expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and our financial position due to our acquisition strategy 
in december   the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this statement is effective prospectively  except for certain retrospective disclosure requirements  for fiscal years beginning after december  management is evaluating the impact adopting sfas will have on the company s results of operations and financial position 
critical accounting policies several of the company s accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for collectability of accounts receivable 
the company estimates the collectability considering historical  current and anticipated trends related to deductions taken by customers and markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of its licensees customers 
with its new licensing model  the company has eliminated its inventory risk and substantially reduced its operating risks  and can now reasonably forecast revenues and plan expenditures based upon guaranteed royalty minimums 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
in connection with its licensing model  the company has entered into various trademark license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales 
also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon the company s adoption of sfas no 
on february   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under sfas no 
 the company had goodwill tested for impairment during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  and no impairments were necessary 
the candie s and bongo trademarks had previously been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of approximately years 
effective july   the company changed for accounting purposes  the estimated useful lives of the candie s and bongo trademarks to be an indefinite life 
accordingly  the recorded value of these trademarks will no longer be amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
in arriving at the conclusion to use an indefinite life management considered among other things  the company s new licensing business model which has expanded the extent of potential use of these brand names in future years 
in connection with the candies license signed with kohl s in late the candie s name  which has been in the us market since the s  has been expanded to approximately product categories in almost kohl s retail locations 
similarly  the bongo brand has expanded from a predominantly jeanswear brand to a broad variety of product groups and multiple licenses in the us and internationally 
brand recognition for both of these brands is very high  has been generally stable for an extended period of time  and the company expects this consumer recognition and acceptance to remain stable or grow in the future based on anticipated broader distribution and product line expansion 
the impact of this change in estimate for fiscal was a reduction in amortization expense relating to the candie s and bongo trademarks totaling  or per fully diluted earning per share 
as of december   the net book value of the candie s and bongo trademarks totaled million 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for share based payment  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
under sfas r  using the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  in december  our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all employee service based stock options previously granted under our various non qualified stock option plans  which would have been unvested as of december  as a result  all options granted as of december   except certain options based on performance  became exercisable immediately 
the number of shares  exercise prices and other terms of the options subject to the acceleration remain unchanged 
the acceleration of such option vesting resulted in an additional  of compensation expense reflected in pro forma net income for the year ended december   an amount that would have otherwise been recorded as compensation expense in the years ending december  and  but had no impact on compensation recognition in as the options would have otherwise vested 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  the compensation cost for stock options had been measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the impact on our financial condition and results of operations from the adoption of sfas no 
r will depend on the number and terms of stock options granted in future years under the modified prospective method  the amount of which we cannot currently estimate

a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of the company s business 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including the company s completed transition into a licensing business  estimates of future profitability based on projected royalty revenues from its licensees  and the overall prospects of the company s business  management concluded in fiscal that it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset recorded as of december  will be realized

the total unrecognized tax benefit was million at the date of adoption

to mitigate interest rate risks  the company is  utilizing derivative financial instruments such as interest rate hedges to convert certain portions of the company s variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
the company invested in certain investment grade auction rate securities 
during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  our balance of auction rate securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these funds will not be available to us until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
as a result  million of auction rate securities were written down to million as an unrealized pre tax loss of million to reflect a temporary decrease in fair value 
the company believes this decrease in fair value is temporary due to general macroeconomic market conditions  as the underlying securities have maintained their investment grade rating 
as the write down of million has been identified as a temporary decrease in fair value  the write down will not impact our earnings and is reflected as an other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
in connection with the initial sale of convertible notes  the company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of merrill lynch and lehman brothers  which hedging transactions are expected  but are not guaranteed  to eliminate the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes 
at the same time  the company entered into sold warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties 
in connection with such transactions  the hedge counterparties entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to the company s common stock and purchased the company s common stock  and they may enter into or unwind various over the counter derivatives and or purchase or sell the company s common stock in secondary market transactions in the future 
such activities could have the effect of increasing  or preventing a decline in  the price of our common stock 
such effect is expected to be greater in the event we elect to settle converted notes entirely in cash 
the hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible notes or termination of the transactions by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock  other of our securities  or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
in particular  such hedging modification may occur during any conversion reference period for a conversion of notes 
in addition  we intend to exercise options we hold under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted and we have elected  with respect to such conversion  to pay a portion of the consideration then due by us to the noteholder in shares of our common stock 
in order to unwind their hedge positions with respect to those exercised options  the hedge counterparties will likely sell shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the conversion reference period for the converted notes 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
also  the sold warrant transaction could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants
