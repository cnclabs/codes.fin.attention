provision for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based on management s assessment of the estimable and probable losses in the loan portfolio  pursuant to accounting literature  which is discussed further in the nonperforming assets section of management s discussion and analysis 
management s evaluation is based upon a review of the portfolio and requires significant judgement 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million compared to million in and million in in  the provision was primarily affected by continued significant loan growth  migration of certain loans toward lower credit grades as we continue to assess our exposure in the current lending environment  partially offset by a lower level of estimated losses resulting from an improvement in the methodology for estimating loan losses using historical data adjusted for current conditions and trends 
the improvement in this methodology resulted in a net reduction of approximately million from the estimate previously used 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased million to million in  or  from million in this is attributable to a million increase in deposit service charges as we continue to benefit from increased deposit accounts and offering additional fee based services 
the increase also includes a million non recurring gain related to the sale of our former headquarters building and an  gain from the sale of our credit card portfolio 
credit debit card and atm income also increased  as a result of increased volumes of cash in non owned atms and higher bailment fees earned on this cash 
in we also recorded two offsetting million items 
both occurred during the fourth quarter and resulted in a gain and an expense recognized from the donation of a nc wyeth mural  apotheosis of the family  which was located in our former headquarters 
during  we recognized a loss of million on the sale of below market yielding securities 
this sale was part of our efforts to improve our earning asset mix and return on assets 
noninterest income increased million to million in  or  from million in the largest increase was attributable to million in card and atm income as a result of increased volumes of cash in non owned atms and higher bailment rates earned on this cash 
deposit service charges also increased million as a result of growth in deposit accounts as well as additional fee based services we provided 
during  noninterest income was impacted by unanticipated income of million in our investment in bank owned life insurance boli resulting from a death benefit we received 
also  during  we recognized a loss of million on the sale of below market yielding securities 
this sale was part of our efforts to improve our earning asset mix and return on assets 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses for the year ended were million  an increase of  or million over million recognized in the increase reflects our continued growth efforts in and included the opening of three branch offices  one branch renovation  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
as a result of this growth  the number of full time associates grew to  resulting in increased salaries  benefits and other compensation of million 
this growth also affected both occupancy expense  which increased by million  and other operating expenses  which increased by million 
during our marketing expenses increased million  as a multi year brand campaign was launched with the intent to leverage our stellar service model with the message we stand for service 
also during  we recorded a million expense related to the visa antitrust lawsuit settlement with american express and other visa related litigation 
we are not a party to any of these lawsuits and our expense solely results from our being a member of visa 
wsfs expects the proceeds from the anticipated share redemption for its ownership interest in visa s planned initial public offering will be applied to this charge 
noninterest expenses increased million to million in  or  from million in salaries  benefits and other compensation increased million as a result of our continued growth including the opening of three branch offices and two branch renovations relocations in and the formation of the wealth management division 
the number of full time associates increased from in to in the growth was also reflected in higher equipment and other operating expenses with an increase of  in equipment expense and million in other operating expenses 
additionally  million of the increase in salaries  benefits and other compensation was the result of the implementation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
income taxes 
we recorded a million tax provision for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a million tax benefit related to the previously discussed donation of our nc wyeth mural 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes that are currently payable or deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax reporting bases of the assets and liabilities 
we analyze our projection of taxable income and make adjustments to our provision for income taxes accordingly

financial condition total assets increased million  or  during to billion 
this increase was predominantly due to growth in net loans  which grew million  or  during this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities 
total liabilities increased million during the year to billion at december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in customer deposits of million  or  during  and an increase in total borrowings of million  or 
partially offsetting these increases was a million  or  decrease in brokered deposits 
cash in non owned atms 
during  cash in non owned atms managed by cashconnect  our atm unit  increased million  or 
this increase was the result of an increase in the number of atms serviced by cashconnect from  at december  to  at december  of these  atms were wsfs owned and operated during mortgage backed securities

stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased  to million at december  this decrease was mainly due to our purchase of  shares of treasury stock for million 
at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury stock 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares depending on stock price and alternative uses of capital 
in addition  we declared cash dividends totaling million during these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in total comprehensive income  including million in net income  and a million increase related to the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

asset liability management our primary asset liability management goal is to maximize net interest income opportunities within the constraints of managing interest rate risk  while ensuring adequate liquidity and funding and maintaining a strong capital base 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity  and use a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of our primary strategies to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table caption less than one one to over total year five years five years dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets 
del real estate loans     commercial loans     consumer loans     mortgage backed securities     loans held for sale   investment securities     interest bearing deposits in other banks   interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    retail time deposits     jumbo certificates of deposit   brokered certificates of deposit    fhlb advances     trust preferred borrowings   other borrowed funds     deficiency excess of interest rate sensitive     assets over interest rate liabilities interest rate sensitive gap one year interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities one year interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets del 
includes commercial mortgage  construction  and residential mortgage loans 
loan balances exclude deferred fees and costs 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as we adjust our interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate position of our one year gap  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of our deposit accounts  that of money market and of interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that to of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five year category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
reverse mortgages we hold an investment in reverse mortgages of million at december  representing a participation in reverse mortgages with a third party 
reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout the borrower s life or until the borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  which means that the loan repayments are generally limited to the net sale proceeds of the borrower s residence 
we account for our investment in reverse mortgages by estimating the value of the future cash flows on the reverse mortgages at a rate deemed appropriate for these mortgages  based on the market rate for similar collateral 
actual cash flows from the maturity of these mortgage loans can result in significant volatility in the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets 
as a result  income varies significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for the year ended december   we earned million in interest income on reverse mortgages as compared to  in and  in the projected cash flows depend on assumptions about life expectancy of the mortgagee and the future changes in collateral values 
projecting the changes in collateral values is the most significant factor impacting the volatility of reverse mortgage values 
our current assumptions include a short term annual appreciation rate of in the first year  and a long term annual appreciation rate of in future years 
if the long term appreciation rate was increased to  the resulting impact on income would have been  conversely  if the long term appreciation rate was decreased to  the resulting impact on income would have been 
we also hold million in bbb rated mortgage backed securities classified as trading and options to acquire up to of class o certificates issued in connection with securities consisting of a portfolio of reverse mortgages we previously owned 
at the time of the securitization  the third party securitizer retained of the class o certificates from the securitization 
these class o certificates have no priority over other classes of certificates under the trust and no distributions will be made on the class o certificates until  among other conditions  the principal amount of each other class of notes has been reduced to zero 
the underlying assets  the reverse mortgages  are very long term assets 
therefore  any cash flow that might inure to the holder of the class o certificates is not expected to occur until many years in the future 
additionally  we can exercise our option on of the class o certificates in up to five separate increments for an aggregate purchase price of million any time between january  and the termination of the securitization trust 
the option to purchase the class o certificates does not meet the definition of a derivative under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities and is carried in our financial statements at cost 
during  we formed a new reverse mortgage initiative 
while our activity during the past two years has been limited to acting as a correspondent for these loans  it is our intention to originate and underwrite our own reverse mortgages in the future 
we expect to sell most of these loans and do not intend to hold them in our portfolio 
these reverse mortgages are government approved and insured 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure  can negatively affect our results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated caption december  dollars in thousands

total nonperforming assets increased million during as a result  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december  this increase results primarily from two large lending relationships being placed on nonaccrual during the first is a million lending relationship consisting of million in construction loans and million in commercial mortgages 
we charged off million against this relationship during the fourth quarter of the second is an asset based loan for million that was subsequently sold in march at a loss 
the amount of this loss has been charged against this loan as of december  based on the sale  we charged off million from our allowance for loan losses at december  the relationship also included unused letters of credit amounting to  we increased our contingency reserve for losses on the letters of credit associated with this relationship by  at december  the following table provides an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three years year ended december  in thousands beginning balance    additions    collections    transfers to accrual charge offs write downs  ending balance    allowance for loan losses 
we maintain allowances for credit losses and charge losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgement reflecting management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
we established our loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
its methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans  and allowances for pooled homogenous loans 
specific reserves are established for certain loans in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred 
the formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans are calculated by applying estimated loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of loans 
for low risk commercial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is pooled  based on internal risk grade  and estimates are based on a ten year net charge off history 
higher risk and criticized loans have loss factors that are derived from an analysis of both the probability of default and the probability of loss should default occur 
loss adjustment factors are applied based on criteria discussed below 
as a result  changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
pooled loans are loans that are usually smaller  not individually graded and homogenous in nature  such as consumer installment loans and residential mortgages 
loan loss allowances for pooled loans are based on a ten year net charge off history 
the average loss allowance per homogenous pool is based on the product of average annual historical loss rate and the estimated duration of the pool multiplied by the pool balances 
these separate risk pools are assigned a reserve for losses based upon this historical loss information and loss adjustment factors 
historical loss adjustment factors are based upon our evaluation of various current conditions including those listed below o general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  o credit quality trends  o recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  o collateral values and loan to value ratios  o loan volumes and concentrations  including changes in mix  o seasoning of the loan portfolio  o specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  o bank regulatory examination results  and o other factors  including changes in quality of the loan origination  servicing and risk management processes 
our loan officers and risk managers meet at least quarterly to discuss and review these conditions and risks associated with individual problem loans 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for such losses 
we also give consideration to the results of these regulatory agency examinations 
during  the provision for loan losses were affected by our continued significant loan growth  migration of certain loans toward lower credit grades as we continue to assess our exposure in the current lending environment  partially offset by a lower level of estimated losses resulting from an improvement in the methodology for estimating loan losses using historical data adjusted for current conditions and trends 
the improvement in this methodology resulted in a reduction of approximately million  net  from the estimate previously used

liquidity we manage our liquidity risk and funding needs through our treasury function and our asset liability committee 
historically  we have had success in growing our loan portfolio 
for example  during the year ended december   net loan growth resulted in the use of million in cash 
the loan growth was primarily the result of our continued success increasing corporate and small business lending 
we expect this trend to continue 
while our loan to deposit ratio has been well above for many years  management has significant experience managing its funding needs through borrowings and deposit growth 
as a financial institution  we have ready access to several sources of funding 
among these are o deposit growth  o borrowing from the fhlb  o the brokered deposit market  o other borrowings such as repurchase agreements  o cash flow from securities  loan sales and repayments  and o our ability to generate positive cash flows from our operations 
our current branch expansion and renovation program is focused on expanding our retail footprint in delaware and attracting new customers to provide additional deposit growth 
customer deposit growth was strong  equaling million  or  during our portfolio of high quality  liquid investments  primarily short duration aaa rated  mortgage backed securities and agency notes also provide a source of cash flow to meet current cash needs 
if needed  portions of this portfolio  as well as portions of the loan portfolio  could be sold to provide cash to fund new loans 
during the year ended december   million in cash was provided by operating activities 
we have a policy that separately addresses liquidity  and management monitors our adherence to policy limits 
as part of the liquidity management process  we also monitor our available wholesale funding capacity 
at december   we had million in funding capacity at the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and million in estimated funding capacity in brokered deposits 
liquidity risk management is a primary area of focus for us and is subject to examination by the ots 
we have not used and have no intention of using any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity management purposes 
our financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments  obligations of letters of credit and an interest rate cap which limits the interest rate exposure on million of trust preferred floating rate debt 
in addition  we have not had and have no intention to have any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as us to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   we are classified as well capitalized  the highest regulatory defined level  and in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
additional information concerning our regulatory capital compliance is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  the board of directors has approved several stock repurchase programs to acquire common stock outstanding 
as part of these programs  we acquired approximately  shares in and  shares in at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury shares 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares depending on stock price and alternative uses of capital 
at december   we had  shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization

impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent legislation in february  congress passed the federal deposit insurance reform act of fdira 
this legislation merged the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund into one fund  increased insurance coverage for retirement accounts to  adjusted the maximum deposit insurance for inflation after march  and gave the fdic greater flexibility in setting insurance assessments 
as part of the fdira  the bank had been granted a one time credit of million for utilization against future fdic insurance premiums 
during  we used  of this credit to offset premiums 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for loan losses  contingencies including indemnifications  and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgements on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that involve more significant judgements and estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain allowances for credit losses and charge losses to these allowances when realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgement reflecting our best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as those in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios  with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
contingencies including indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal actions  which involve claims for monetary relief 
based upon information presently available to us and our counsel  it is our opinion that any legal and financial responsibility arising from such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we maintain a loss contingency for standby letters of credit and charge losses to this reserve when such losses are realized 
the determination of the loss contingency for standby letters of credit requires significant judgement reflecting management s best estimate of probable losses 
the bank  as successor to originators of reverse mortgages is  from time to time  involved in arbitration or litigation with various parties including borrowers or the heirs of borrowers 
because reverse mortgages are a relatively new and uncommon product  there can be no assurances about how the courts or arbitrators may apply existing legal principles to the interpretation and enforcement of the terms and conditions of the bank s reverse mortgage obligations 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we have assessed our valuation allowances on deferred income taxes resulting from  among other things  limitations imposed by internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization of these differences 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
one measure required to be performed by the office of thrift supervision ots regulated institutions is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of the estimated cash flows from assets and liabilities as a percentage of the net present value of assets 
the following table is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no

the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate environment changes 
our net portfolio value in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected under the various rate environment changes 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points may not be particularly meaningful at december  and given the historically low absolute level of interest rates at these dates 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on our asset liability structure 
we rely primarily on our asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
we also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates 
these fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate
