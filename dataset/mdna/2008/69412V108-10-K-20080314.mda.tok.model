on november   the company acquired nwbf for a combination of stock and cash 
combined  the stock and cash transaction was valued at approximately  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations of nwbf have been included in the consolidated financial statement only since the date of acquisition 
per share data for and was retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend paid in june tangible equity excludes goodwill and core deposit intangible related to acquisitions 
net income for the year was  an increase of or over the  reported for the year net income improvement in over was modest due to much slower growth in operating revenue  which was up in over growth in operating revenue is primarily driven by net interest income  which accounted for of total operating revenue in while average earning assets increased in over  growth in net interest income in was slowed by an basis point compression in the net interest margin 
offsetting some of the impact from slower revenue growth was effective management of noninterest expense growth 
during  the company implemented a number of cost control initiatives that stabilized noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis beginning with the first quarter and overall saw growth in noninterest expense in when compared to the company earned  in compared to  in growth in operating revenue  was primarily responsible for the increased earnings in over operating revenues were  in  up  or over operating revenue growth was driven by a increase in average earning assets resulting in a  increase in net interest income 
growth in earning assets was due to the full year effect of assets acquired in the nwbf acquisition and organic growth 
when comparing and results  it is also fair to consider the effects of several unusual transactions and the adoption of new accounting standards 
effective january   the company implemented fas r  share based payment  which requires the expensing of stock based compensation 
the company elected to implement fas r using the modified prospective method  meaning there was no restatement of prior periods 
had the accounting principle been effective in  the company would have recognized in stock based compensation expense which would have reduced full year diluted earnings per share by

the ability to grow core deposits  to fund loan growth during a continuation of high rates on alternative funding sources or inability to tap alternative funding sources due to current disruption in the financial and capital markets flowing from the significant downturn in the housing industry a continuation of the relatively flat yield curve that would reduce spreads between the bank s yield on fixed rate loans and the bank s short term borrowing costs and costs of core deposits  which could negatively affect the net interest margin and revenue growth 
the ability to manage noninterest expense growth in light of possible slow revenue growth 
increased expenses related to personnel costs and the rising costs of providing employee benefits plus staffing  consulting  fees  and other expenses related to internal auditing and compliance with current and future regulations

summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations  or liquidity 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had  in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis of the intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december    and share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based forms of compensation issued to employees 
this standard became effective in the first quarter of the method for determining the grant date fair value of equity based payments under fas r is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the company adopted fas r using the modified prospective method 
therefore  previously reported financial data was not restated  and expenses related to equity based payments granted and vesting during and were recorded as compensation expense 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
th quarter compared to th quarter two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for the fourth quarter and fourth quarter table i average balance analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
the bank s net interest margin for the fourth quarter was compared to for the fourth quarter table i shows that earning asset yields for the fourth quarter of were down basis points from fourth quarter earning asset yields due primarily to a basis point decline in the yield on net loans 
the decline in loan yields was due to the basis point drop in the bank s prime lending rate during the last four months of that lowered yields on the bank s variable rate loan portfolio 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities also showed a decline from for fourth quarter to for fourth quarter this decrease is reflected in both the cost of interest bearing core deposits and cost of alternative funding 
however  note that the cost of the alternative funding dropped only basis points compared to basis points for the cost of core deposits 
this relatively smaller decline in the cost of alternative funding is reflective of the recent turmoil in the financial markets  which has created liquidity issues for many large financial institutions and has kept the cost of alternative or wholesale funding higher than the cost of core deposits 
each of the bank s interest bearing core deposit categories showed a decrease in rates  with the exception of core time deposits 
the rates on core time deposits did not fall due to the lag effect of the repricing of these instruments 
for the quarter ended december   the cost of interest bearing core deposits was or basis points below the cost of alternative funding at 
when average noninterest bearing deposits of  are included in the core deposit base  the average cost of core deposits drops to for the fourth quarter or basis points below the cost of alternative funding 
table ii  which provides the change in net interest income due to volume and rate  shows that interest income including loan fees improved by over the same period last year 
higher volumes of earning assets increased interest income by  and while lower yields on loans decreased interest income by table ii shows that interest expense for the quarter ended december  increased by over the same quarter last year  as higher volumes and changes in mix of deposits and alternative funding increased interest expense by  while lower rates on all deposits and alternative funding categories caused interest expense to decrease by table i average balance analysis of net interest earnings dollars in thousands quarter ended quarter ended december  december  interest average interest average average income or yields or average income or yields or balance expense rates balance expense rates interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks securities available for sale taxable tax exempt loans  net of allowance for loan losses total interest earning assets non earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment goodwill other intangibles interest receivable and other total non interest assets total assets interest bearing liabilities money market and now accounts savings deposits time deposits core total interest bearing core deposits time deposits non core federal funds purchased fhlb borrowings trust preferred total interest bearing alternative funding total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits interest payable and other total noninterest liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income net interest income as a percent of earning assets federal home loan bank stock is included in securities available for sale

table iv  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
the net interest margin for the full year was  a decline of basis points from the net interest margin reported for the year table iii shows that earning asset yields improved by basis points for the year when compared to from to 
compression in the net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in the bank s cost of funding  which more than offset the growth in earning asset yields 
table iii shows the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year was up basis points from in to in table iii also illustrates the difference between the cost of interest bearing core deposits for the year as compared to the cost of interest bearing alternative funding 
the cost of interest bearing core deposits was or basis points less than the cost of alternative funding 
when noninterest bearing demand deposits are included in the core deposit base the overall cost of the bank s core deposit base falls to or basis points below the cost of alternative funding 
the year to date december  rate volume analysis shows that interest income including loan fees improved by  over last year 
higher volumes of earning assets increased interest income by  and higher yields on loans increased interest income by the rate volume analysis shows that interest expense for the year increased by  over last year  as higher volumes on all deposit categories caused interest expense to increase by  combined with higher rates  which increased interest expense by  on december   the federal reserve lowered market interest rates by basis points and lowered market interest rates by basis points in the last three and one half months of the year due to the bank s balanced interest rate risk profile  the net interest margin is not expected to be materially impacted by the recent or any future decline in short term market interest rates 
however  should short term market interest rates fall precipitously  some margin compression is likely due to the fact the rates on certain core deposits  such as interest checking  money market  and savings accounts will be at virtual floors 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  over net interest income of  the growth in net interest income in over was attributable to a  or increase in earning assets 
the acquisition of nwbf in november  was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  thus the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the balance sheet only since the date of acquisition 
the earning assets acquired in this transaction accounted for approximately  of the growth in earning assets in when compared to for the year  the net interest income as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points from to 
much of the decline in the net interest margin in when compared to can be attributed to the acquisition of nwbf  which had a much lower net interest margin at than the bank s net interest margin of approximately prior to the acquisition 
for  interest and fees earned on earning assets increased by  over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes and improved  due to higher yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning assets 
growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to loan growth as average loans  net of the allowance for loan losses for the year  were up  or over the acquisition of nwbf increased average loans by approximately  in when compared to referring to table iii  earning asset yields increased by basis points  from in to in the improvement in earning asset yield was primarily due to increased loan yields  which were up basis points in over the increase in loan yields is reflective of the consistent increase in the prime lending rate throughout the first six months of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during increased by  over referring to table iii  overall average interest bearing liabilities in increased by  over  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from to 
the acquisition of nwbf accounted for a substantial portion of the growth in interest bearing deposits in addition to the organic growth from the two oregon markets 
referring to table iv  interest expense increased by  due to the change in the mix and increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
table iv also indicates that interest expense for the year increased an additional  due to higher rates  a direct result of the increase in short term market interest rates during the first six months of table iv shows the increase in the average volumes of money market and now accounts  time deposits  and fhlb borrowings  were primarily responsible for the increase in interest expense due to higher volumes for when compared to the increase in interest expense for the year over resulting from higher rates was primarily due to increased volumes and a higher rate paid on money market and now accounts  time deposits  and fhlb borrowings 
table iii shows the average volume of money market and now accounts increased  or  and average time deposit volume increased  or over average volumes  while the rate on these deposits increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
tables iii and iv show that the increase in the average balance of fhlb term borrowings increased  and accounted for  or of the total increase in interest expense for the year over that was related to volume 
the average balance of trust preferred securities increased by  in over  which resulted in additional interest expense in over the trust preferred securities were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of nwbf and thus were only included in the average balance sheet since the date of acquisition on november  table iii average balance analysis of net interest earnings average interest average average interest average average interest average balance income expense yield cost balance income expense yield cost balance income expense yield cost dollars in thousands dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks securities available for sale taxable tax exempt loans  net of allowance for loan losses total interest earning assets non earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment goodwill other intangibles interest receivable and other total non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities money market and now accounts savings deposits time deposits core total interest bearing core deposits time deposits non core federal funds purchased fhlb borrowings trust preferred total interest bearing alternative funding total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits interest payable and other total noninterest bearing liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income net interest income as a percent of earning assets federal home loan bank stock is included in securities available for sale

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled in  in  and  in the increase in the provision for when compared to was due to loan growth and increased economic uncertainty  although the overall credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio remains good despite a modest increase in nonperforming loans 
the lower provision for when compared resulted from improvement in credit quality throughout the year at december   the bank had  or of total assets in nonperforming assets  net of government guarantees compared to none at december  nonperforming assets at december  consist of  of nonaccrual loans net of in government guarantees and of other real estate owned consisting of three residential properties 
approximately  of the nonaccrual loans at december  are consumer residential construction loans 
management presently does not expect any significant losses on these or any future nonperforming loans in the consumer residential construction segment of the loan portfolio due to a cash secured principal guarantee for each of these loans 
in addition  no special allocation to the allowance for loan losses for these specific loans is expected 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was  of outstanding loans compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
at december   the bank also has reserved for possible losses on unfunded loan commitments  which is classified in other liabilities 
the ending allowance includes in specific allowance for  in impaired loans net of government guarantees 
at december   the company had of impaired loans net of government guarantees with a specific allowance assigned of net loan charge offs were in compared to in  and in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were   and for   and  respectively 
looking forward  the provision for loans losses will be contingent on current economic and market conditions  and overall loan growth 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for estimated loan losses in the portfolio at year end based on management s assessment of various factors including past due and impaired loans  past history and loss experience  loan concentrations in specific industries  and current economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
compared to noninterest income in was  down or from the  reported for the year excluding the one time gain of on the sale of property included in results  noninterest income in was down or from the following discussion will exclude the effect of the gain on sale of property in the decline in noninterest income when compared to was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income 
the decline in mortgage banking income was attributable to a significant slow down in the residential housing market 
the decline in mortgage banking income was partially offset by increases in service charges on deposit accounts  other fee income  principally bankcard processing fee income  and the other income category 
service charges on deposit accounts increased or due to lower earnings credit rate  which increased fees on analyzed business accounts 
other fee income  principally bankcard processing fee income in increased or over bankcard processing fee income accounted for of this increase  while other service charge income  primarily wire transfer fees accounted for of this increase 
the other income category in was  a or increase over the reported in the other income category for the year the increase in the other income category was due to collection of approximately in loan referral fees during the year compared to noninterest income in was  up or from excluding the nonrecurring gain on the sale of property of  noninterest income was down from total noninterest income through december  included approximately of revenues from the seattle market not included in results 
the decrease in noninterest income excluding the nonrecurring gain on sale of property was primarily due to lower account service charges  mortgage banking revenues  and loan servicing income 
account service charges were down or from as the increased earnings credit on analyzed business accounts lowered fee income 
mortgage banking revenues were down or from as higher long term interest rates slowed the level of mortgage loan originations and the service release premium on loans sold 
loan servicing income was down or from as the average volume of loans serviced declined in from declines in these categories of noninterest income were partially offset by increase in merchant bankcard fee income and a increase in the other income category 
the increase in merchant bankcard revenues resulted from an increase in sales transaction volume 
the increase in the other income category was due to lockbox fees and sundry recoveries 
noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than the provision for loan losses and interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
compared to noninterest expense for the year was  up  or over the  reported for the year all noninterest expense categories showed an increase in when compared to personnel expense in was up  and accounted for of the total increase in noninterest expense in the year 
total salary expense was up or and benefits and taxes were up or over last year due to performance increases for existing employees  increased group insurance  and increased accruals for officer incentives 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in commission expense in from the other expense category accounted for the majority of the remaining increase in noninterest expense in over other expenses were  in  up or over other expenses of  the increase in the other expense category can be attributed to the following areas increased fdic assessment of  increased communications expense primarily armored car and courier services of  increased other data processing expense of due to new contracts in place  increased expense related to the unfunded loan commitment of  and increased local taxes multnomah county and state of washington b o taxes of during the year  management implemented a number of cost control initiatives 
on a linked quarter basis  noninterest expenses during the year  beginning with the first quarter  were    and  reflecting the effectiveness of the cost controls put into place 
compared to noninterest expense in was  up  or over with every expense category up in when compared to total noninterest expense in includes  of expenses from the seattle market not included in results 
in addition  the company implemented fas r in  which required the expensing of equity based compensation 
the company implemented this new accounting principle using the modified prospective basis  meaning there was no restatement of prior periods 
for the year  the company recognized more in equity compensation expense than was recorded during excluding the  increase due to seattle market expenses and equity based compensation of  noninterest expense in increased  or over increased personnel expense accounted for the majority of the total increase in noninterest expense 
total personnel expense was up  and accounted for of the total increase in noninterest expense 
the increase in personnel expense in over reflects the addition of the seattle market  increased staffing in the portland market where two new offices were opened  and increased administrative staff 
premises and equipment expense was up or and reflects the new costs in the seattle market  plus additional expense related to new offices in the portland market 
the other expense category was up  or primarily due to higher professional services including legal fees  consulting fees  and fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act

 dec 
 decrease decrease eugene market portland market seattle market total the seattle market was primarily responsible for the majority of the growth in outstanding loans for the company during outstanding loan growth in the portland market slowed in as compared to prior years  and much of the decline in the eugene market loans can be attributed to the sale of approximately  of consumer finance division loans during the year more information on the loan portfolio can be found in statistical information in item and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had a recorded balance of  in goodwill from the november  acquisition of nwbf 
during the year  the bank sold the loans and offices of its consumer finance division and eliminated of goodwill from the acquisition of the coos bay consumer finance office 
in addition  at december  the company had  core deposit intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of nwbf 
the core deposit intangible was determined to have an expected life of approximately seven years and is being amortized over that period using the straight line method 
during  the company amortized of the core deposit intangible 
in accordance with financial accounting standard fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead periodically tests these assets for impairment 
management did perform an impairment analysis at december  and determined there was no impairment of the goodwill at the time of the analysis 
deposits outstanding deposits at december  were  an increase of  over outstanding deposits of  at december  core deposits  which are defined by the company as demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits  including local time deposits in excess of thousand  were  up over outstanding core deposits of  at december  at december  and  respectively  core deposits represented and of total deposits  respectively 
a summary of deposit growth by market for the year follows balance balance increase increase dec 
 dec 
 decrease decrease eugene market core deposits portland market core deposits seattle market core deposits total core deposits other deposits total growth in outstanding core deposits was driven primarily by the seattle and eugene markets 
outstanding core deposits in the portland market showed a decline of  primarily due to reduction in balances of several of the market s large depositors  which continue to maintain relationships with the bank 
the other deposit category includes national market cds  brokered cds  and public funds 
the  decline in these balances in when compared to was attributable to the disruption in the financial markets in the last five months of resulting from the significant slowdown and credit quality problems in the residential housing market 
rates on these alternative funding sources spiked and remained very high relative to other alternative funding sources  thus the bank elected to allow these deposits to mature and used primarily fhlb funding rather than these higher rate sources of funding 
junior subordinated debentures the company had  in junior subordinated debentures at december   which were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of nwbf 
at december   the entire  in junior subordinated debentures had an interest rate of that is fixed through november as of december   the entire balance of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as tier capital under regulatory capital purposes 
additional information regarding the terms of the junior subordinated debentures  including maturity repricing dates and interest rate  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
capital resources capital is the shareholders investment in the company 
capital grows through the retention of earnings and the issuance of new stock through the exercise of stock options 
capital formation allows the company to grow assets and provides flexibility in times of adversity 
shareholders equity at december  was  an increase of  or from december  the increase in shareholders equity during was principally due to the retention of approximately  net income for the year and the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefit accounted for another  the federal reserve board and the fdic have in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
these guidelines require a minimum of total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
the regulations also specify that a total risk based capital ratio is required to be designated well capitalized the highest fdic capital rating by the fdic 
the company s tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill  and deposit based intangibles  totaled  at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i and tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was  at december  the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  at december  compared to at december  the company pays cash dividends on a quarterly basis  typically in march  june  september and december of each year 
the board of directors considers the dividend amount quarterly and takes a broad perspective in its dividend deliberations including a review of recent operating performance  capital levels  and concentrations of loans as a percentage of capital  and growth projections 
the board also considers dividend payout ratios  dividend yield  and other financial metrics in setting the quarterly dividend 
the company declared and paid cash dividends of per share for the year when adjusted for the stock dividend paid in june that compares to dividends of paid during  also retroactively adjusted for the stock dividend paid in june the board of directors  at its february  meeting  approved a dividend of per share for shareholders of record as of february  if continued for each quarter during  this would result in an annual increase of in dividends over dividends 
the company projects that earnings retention and existing capital will be sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth  while maintaining a well capitalized designation from all regulatory agencies 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments in the normal course of business  the bank commits to extensions of credit and issues letters of credit 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend funds and conditional obligations as it does for other credit products 
in the event of nonperformance by the customer  the bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract 
since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december   the bank had  in commitments to extend credit 
letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
at december   the bank had  in letters of credit and financial guarantees written 
the bank also has internal guidance lines of credit established for certain borrowers  primarily in the residential construction industry 
these guidance lines are not contractual commitments to extend credit  and may be terminated by the bank for any reason without any obligation to the borrower 
these lines provide the bank s lenders limits on future extensions of credit to certain borrowers 
the bank uses the same credit policies in establishing internal guidance lines as it does for other credit products 
at december   the bank had established unused and uncommitted guidance lines totaling approximately  compared to unused and uncommitted guidance lines of  at december  the company has certain other financial commitments 
these future financial commitments are outlined below contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than one year years years more than years junior subordinated debenture fhlb borrowings time deposits operating lease obligations liquidity liquidity is the term used to define the company s ability to meet its financial commitments 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits  including local time deposits in excess of additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits compared to at december  core deposit growth of  in all markets funded of loan growth during the year the remainder of loan growth was funded through alternative funding sources  including overnight borrowed funds  federal home loan bank term advances  public deposits available from the state of oregon and state of washington  national market time deposits  and brokered time deposits 
the company has deposit relationships with several large clients  which are closely monitored by bank officers 
at december   large deposit relationships with the bank account for  or of total deposits 
the single largest client represented of total deposits at december  the loss of this deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company expects to maintain these relationships and believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity to mitigate the loss of one or more of these clients 
borrowing lines have been established at various correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of seattle and with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
at december   the bank had secured and unsecured borrowing lines totaling approximately  consisting of  with the federal home loan bank of seattle   with various correspondent banks  and  with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the federal home loan bank borrowing line is limited to the amount of collateral pledged 
at december   the bank had collateral pledged to the fhlb in the form of commercial real estate loans that had a discounted collateral value of approximately  for this line 
the  borrowing line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco is also secured through the pledging of commercial loans under the bank s borrower in custody program 
the  in borrowing lines with correspondent banks is unsecured 
at december   the bank had  in borrowings outstanding from the fhlb of seattle and  outstanding on its overnight correspondent bank lines 
in addition  the bank is part of the state of oregon and state of washington community bank time deposit program and at december  had approximately  available from these sources 
the bank s loan portfolio also contains approximately  in guaranteed government loans  which can be sold on the secondary market 
inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although permitted by its funds management policy  the company does not presently use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
in addition to the interest rate shock analysis  the company also prepares a rolling four quarter forecast of the balance sheet and income statement using a flat rate scenario ie rates unchanged and a most likely rate scenario where rates are projected to change based on management s analysis of expected economic conditions and interest rate environment 
this analysis takes into account growth in loans and deposits and management strategies that could be employed to maximize the net interest margin and net interest income 
the company utilizes in house asset liability modeling software  profitstar to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in a parallel shift of the yield curve in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
during  the model indicated that the company continued to be asset sensitive and projects rising margins in a rising rate environment and declining margins in a falling rate environment 
however  the shape of the yield curve may significantly affect these projections 
the following table shows the estimated impact of interest rate changes plus basis points and minus basis points on net interest income in basis point increments 
the base figure of  used in the analysis represents actual net interest income for the year due to the various assumptions used for this modeling  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results
