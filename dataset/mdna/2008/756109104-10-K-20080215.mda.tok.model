item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust  or reit 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations  or ffo per share 
the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains 
we have in house acquisition  leasing  legal  retail research  real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under long term lease agreements primarily to years 
in addition  we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  retail properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties occupied of the  properties in the portfolio  with only properties available for lease  leased to different retail chains doing business in separate retail industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable retail space per property of approximately  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant  retail properties and the remaining are multi tenant  distribution and office properties 
at december    or  of the  single tenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years 
in addition  at december   our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  crest net lease  inc crest  had invested million in properties  which are classified as held for sale 
crest was created to buy and sell properties  primarily to individual investors who are involved in tax deferred exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the tax code 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our retail properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  which represents a portion of the proceeds from the september issuance of million of senior unsecured notes 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 
million acquisition credit facility we have a million revolving  unsecured credit facility that expires in october in april  moody s investors service upgraded our credit ratings 
since may  our investment grade credit ratings provided for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus basis points with a facility fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
at february   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance 
we expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to million  to a total borrowing capacity of million 
any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks on our credit facility 
we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend  renew or replace our credit facility  to the extent we deem appropriate 
we have the right to extend the credit facility for an additional term of one year to october 
mortgage debt we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 
universal shelf registration in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which is effective for a term of three years 
in accordance with the sec rules  the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed 
the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  or any combination of such securities 
we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement  or other offering materials  at the time of any offering 
there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this new shelf registration before it expires in april  and our common stock  preferred stock and notes issued after april were all issued pursuant to this universal shelf registration statement 
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at february   our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were billion or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 
we define our total market capitalization at february  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of per share on february   or billion  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class d preferred stock of million  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class e preferred stock of million  and outstanding notes of billion 
historically  we have met our long term capital needs through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes and bonds 
over the long term  we believe that common stock may be the majority of our capital structure  however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 
credit agency ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings  on our senior unsecured notes 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s investors service has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes 
the rating by standard poor s has a positive outlook and the ratings by fitch and moody s have stable outlooks 
we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings on our preferred stock 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock 
the rating by standard poor s has a positive outlook and the ratings by fitch and moody s have stable outlooks 
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
moreover  a rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
notes outstanding our senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of december   sorted by maturity date dollars in millions notes  issued in october and due in november notes  issued in january and due in january notes  issued in march and due in march notes  issued in november and due in november notes  issued in september and due in september notes  issued in september and due in september notes  issued in september and due in august bonds  issued in march and due in march all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
interest on all of the senior note obligations is paid semiannually  with the exception of the interest on the senior notes issued in october  which is paid monthly 
all of these notes contain various covenants  including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than times  and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than of our outstanding unsecured debt 
we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued 
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured notes  as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes 
these calculations  which are not based on gaap measurements  are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance 
the actual amounts as of december  are note covenants required actual limitation on incurrence of total debt limitation on incurrence of secured debt debt service coverage x x maintenance of total unencumbered assets of unsecured debt the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december  dollars in millions table of obligations ground ground leases leases paid by paid by year of credit realty our maturity facility notes interest income tenants other totals thereafter totals there was no outstanding credit facility balance on february  interest on the credit facility and notes has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december  through their respective maturity dates 
realty income currently pays the ground lessor directly for the rent under the ground lease 
a majority of this rent is reimbursed to realty income as additional rent from our tenant 
our tenants  who are generally sub tenants under the ground leases  are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases 
in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent  we are primarily responsible 
other consists of million of commitments under construction contracts and  of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured 
accordingly  we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 
we anticipate paying off the notes due in and by one or more of the following  using cash on hand  utilizing our credit facility or issuing new securities 
preferred stock outstanding in  we issued million shares of class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
beginning may   shares of class d preferred stock are redeemable at our option for per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 
in december  we issued million shares of class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
beginning december   shares of class e preferred stock are redeemable at our option for per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 
no off balance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments we have no unconsolidated or off balance sheet investments in variable interest entities or off balance sheet financing  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 
as we have no joint ventures  off balance sheet entities  or mandatory redeemable preferred stock  our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no

these properties are located in states  will contain over million leasable square feet and are leased with an average lease term of years 
the new properties acquired by realty income are net leased to different retail chains in the following nine industries automotive service  automotive tire service  convenience store  distribution and office  drug store  grocery  health and fitness  restaurant and sporting goods 
also included in the million is million invested by crest in new restaurant properties 
the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property that is equal to the base rent or  in the case of properties under development  the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total costs 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 
increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders we continue our year policy of paying distributions monthly 
monthly distributions per share were increased in april by to  in july by to  in september by to  in october by to and in january by to 
the increase in january was our st consecutive quarterly increase and the th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange  or nyse  in in  we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of  three in the amount of  two in the amount of  one in the amount of and three in the amount of  totaling 
in december and january  we declared distributions of per share  which were paid in january and will be paid in february  respectively 
the monthly distribution of per share represents a current annualized distribution of per share  and an annualized distribution yield of approximately based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of on february  although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions  we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions  that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share  or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors  to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
no depreciation has been recorded on crest s properties because they are held for sale 
another significant judgment must be made as to if  and when  impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
generally  a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or 
rental revenue was million in the increase in rental revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to the retail properties acquired by realty income in  which generated million of rent in  the retail properties acquired by realty income in  which generated million of rent in compared to million in  an increase of million  same store rents generated on  properties during the entire years of and increased by million  or  to million from million  net of a decrease of million relating to the aggregate of i development properties acquired before that started paying rent in  ii properties that were vacant during part of or and iii lease termination settlements 
these items totaled million in aggregate in compared to million in  and a decrease in straight line rent and other non cash adjustments to rent of  in as compared to of the  properties in the portfolio at december    or  are single tenant properties and the remaining are multi tenant properties 
of the  single tenant properties   or  were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately years at december  of our  leased single tenant properties   or  were under leases that provide for increases in rents through primarily base rent increases tied to a consumer price index  fixed increases  to a lesser degree  overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants gross sales  or a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 
percentage rent  which is included in rental revenue  was  in  million in and million in percentage rent in was less than of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than of rental revenue in our portfolio of retail real estate  leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases  continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders 
at december   our portfolio of  retail properties was leased with properties available for lease  one of which is a multi tenant property 
as of february   transactions to lease or sell of the properties available for lease at december  were underway or completed 
we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months  although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period 
it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million in versus million in and million in the increases in depreciation and amortization in and were due to the acquisition of properties in  and  which were partially offset by property sales in these years 
as discussed in the section entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders  depreciation and amortization is a non cash item that is excluded from our calculation of ffo 
interest expense interest expense was million higher in than in interest expense increased in primarily due to higher average outstanding balances  which were partially offset by slightly lower interest rates related to our average outstanding borrowings  and crest s larger investment in real estate  which contributed to the increase in interest expense included in discontinued operations 
we issued million of year notes in september and million of year notes in september  which contributed to the increase in average outstanding balances and slightly lower average interest rates on our debt

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in versus million in general and administrative expenses were million in in  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were as compared to in and in general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increases in employee and director compensation costs 
during  we added two new directors to our board of directors 
we anticipate that in  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will be flat or decrease 
in february  we had permanent employees as compared to permanent employees in february as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow  we have increased  and anticipate that we will continue to gradually increase the level of our staffing 
property expenses property expenses are broken down into costs associated with non net leased multi tenant properties  unleased single tenant properties and general portfolio expenses 
expenses related to the multi tenant and unleased single tenant properties include  but are not limited to  property taxes  maintenance  insurance  utilities  property inspections  bad debt expense and legal fees 
general portfolio costs include  but are not limited to  insurance  legal  bad debt expense  property inspections and title search fees 
at december   properties were available for lease  as compared to at december  and at december  property expenses were million in  million in and million in property expenses include provisions for impairment of  recorded for one property in and  recorded for two properties in income taxes income taxes were million in as compared to  in and  in these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income 
the increase in is due primarily to an increase in rental revenue resulting in higher city and state income tax expense and higher state tax rates 
in addition  crest incurred state and federal income taxes of million in as compared to  in and  in the increase in crest s income taxes over the and income taxes is due to higher taxable income  primarily attributable to higher rental revenue and higher gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale 
these amounts are included in income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 
loss on extinguishment of debt in september  we redeemed all of our outstanding million   unsecured notes due may the notes 
the notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest of million  as well as a make whole payment of million 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling million related to the make whole payment associated with the notes 
for  the make whole payment represented approximately per share 
discontinued operations crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties 
consequently  we classify properties acquired by crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them 
the operation of crest s properties is classified as income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income

for two property sales during  crest provided the buyers partial financing for a total of million  of which  was paid in full in november in  crest sold properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
in  crest sold properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
in  crest provided a buyer partial financing of million for one property sale  which was paid in full in february crest s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations 
crest s property inventory at december   crest had million invested in properties  which are held for sale 
at december   crest s property inventory totaled million in properties 
crest generally carries real estate inventory in excess of million 
crest generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties 
it is our belief that at this level of inventory  rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of crest without any property sales 
gain on sales of investment properties  improvements and land by realty income in  we sold ten investment properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
this gain is included in discontinued operations 
in addition  we sold excess land and improvements from five properties for an aggregate of million  which resulted in a gain of million 
this gain from the land and improvements sales is reported in other revenue on our consolidated statements of income because these improvements and excess land were associated with properties that continue to be owned as part of our core operations 
in  we sold or exchanged investment properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million  which is included in discontinued operations 
in  we sold investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for million and recognized a gain on sales of million  which is included in discontinued operations  except for  that is included in other revenue on our consolidated statements of income 
we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns  enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term 
at december   we classified real estate owned by crest with a carrying amount of million as held for sale on our balance sheet 
additionally  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified  from which we anticipate receiving between million and million in proceeds during the next months 
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next months 
provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest in and  no provisions for impairment were recorded by crest 
in  provisions for impairment of million were recorded by crest on three properties 
one of the three properties was sold in crest s properties are held for sale and the provisions for impairment recorded in reduced the carrying costs to the estimated fair market value of those properties  net of estimated selling costs 
provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties in  we recorded a provision for impairment of  on one property  which is included in income from discontinued operations  real estate held for investment on our consolidated statement of income  as the property was subsequently sold 
additionally  we recorded a provision for impairment of  on one property in  which is included in property expense on our consolidated statement of income 
in  we recorded a provision for impairment of  on one property

preferred stock dividends preferred stock cash dividends totaled million in as compared to million in and million in net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders was million in  an increase of million as compared to million in net income available to common stockholders in was million 
the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sales of properties 
the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 
during  the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties was million as compared to million during and million in crest s gain recognized from the sale of properties during was million as compared to million during and million during funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo ffo for increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in and million in the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo 
also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment gain on sales of land and investment properties continuing operations discontinued operations ffo available to common stockholders ffo per common share basic diluted distributions paid to common stockholders ffo in excess of distributions paid to common stockholders weighted average number of common shares used for computation per share basic diluted we define ffo  a non gaap measure  consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition  as net income available to common stockholders  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 
other non cash items and capitalized expenditures the following information includes non cash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio 
these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo 
analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 
dollars in thousands amortization of settlements on treasury lock agreements amortization of deferred note financing costs amortization of share based compensation capitalized leasing costs and commissions capitalized building improvements straight line rent provisions for impairment crest provisions for impairment crest gain on sale  previously reported as impairment gain on reinstatement of property carrying value the settlements on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that we used in and  which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities 
we have not employed this strategy since amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in may  october  january  march  november  march  september  september and september these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes 
no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
a negative amount indicates that our straight line rent was greater than our actual cash rent collected 
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
approximately  or  of the  properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes  primarily at fixed rates  and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate lock agreements  interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the following table presents by year of expected maturity  the principal amounts  average interest rates and fair values as of december  this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions expected maturity data year of maturity fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt thereafter totals fair value million matures in november the credit facility expires in october there was no outstanding credit facility balance as of february  million matures in january million matures in march  million matures in november  million matures in september  million matures in september  million matures in august and million matures in march we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  on the closing market price or indicative price per each note 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates 
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
our credit facility interest rate is variable 
at december   our credit facility balance was zero  however  we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future 
based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of million  a change in interest rates would change our interest costs by  per year
