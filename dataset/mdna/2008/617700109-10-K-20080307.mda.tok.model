key business characteristics revenue we generate revenue by selling a variety of investment related products and services 
we sell many of our offerings  such as our newsletters  principia software  and premium service on morningstar 
com  via subscriptions 
these subscriptions are mainly offered for a one year term  although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years 
we also sell advertising on our web sites throughout the world 
several of our other products are sold through license agreements  including morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar equity research  morningstar direct  morningstar encorr  retirement advice  and licensed data 
our license agreements typically range from one to three years 
for some of our other institutional services  mainly investment consulting  we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under management 
we also earn fees relating to morningstar managed portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management 
overall  revenue tied to asset based fees accounted for about of our consolidated revenue in deferred revenue we frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
as a result  we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development 
the businesses we acquired in and have similar business models  and as a result  we acquired their deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue shown on our balance sheet totaled million as of december  and million as of december  deferred revenue is the largest liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to recognize the deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations under our subscription  license  and service agreements 
significant operating leverage our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content 
we strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographic markets 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as our products and services focus more on internet based platforms and assets under management 
in the past  we have made investments in building our databases and content that have hurt our short term operating results for certain periods 
in the past several years  our profitability has improved because we ve been able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate 
we look for this operating leverage to be evident in our operations over the long term 
operating expense we classify our expenses into separate categories for cost of goods sold  development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization  as described below 
we include stock based compensation expense  as appropriate  in each of these categories 
cost of goods sold 
this category includes the compensation expense for employees who produce the products we deliver to our customers 
for example  this category covers the cost of production teams and analysts who write investment research reports 
cost of goods sold also includes other expenses such as postage  printing  and cd rom replication  as well as shareholder servicing fees for morningstar managed portfolios 
development 
this category mainly includes compensation expense for programmers  designers  and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products 
in some cases  we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects 
this reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category 
we amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software  which is generally three years  and include this expense in depreciation and amortization 
sales and marketing 
this category includes compensation expense for our sales teams  product managers  and other marketing professionals 
we also include the cost of advertising  direct mail campaigns  and other marketing programs to promote our products 
general and administrative 
this category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team  as well as human resources  finance  and support employees for each segment 
the category also includes compensation expense for senior management and corporate expenses  including corporate systems  accounting  legal  and facilities expense 
depreciation and amortization 
our capital expenditures consist mainly of computers  leasehold improvements  and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects 
we depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight line method based on the useful life of the asset  which ranges from three to seven years 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the remaining lease term or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life  which is generally three years 
we also include amortization related to intangible assets  which is mainly driven by acquisitions  in this category 
international operations we consolidate the results of our majority owned operations outside the united states 
we account for our minority owned investments in japan  korea  denmark  and sweden using the equity method 
our international operations continue to become a more important part of our business 
our non us revenue increased to of consolidated revenue in percentage points higher than in how we evaluate our business when our analysts evaluate a stock  they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows  discounted to their worth in today s dollars 
our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way 
our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time  which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders 
we do not make public financial forecasts for our business because they are  by their nature  subjective and could have an effect on our company s stock price 
we want to avoid creating any incentives for people within our company to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price  or to take actions that help us meet short term forecasts but may not be in the long term interest of building shareholder value 
we provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time revenue  operating income loss  and free cash flow  which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure of performance required to be reported under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  and should not be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance or liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
to evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue  we calculate a retention rate 
we use two different methods for calculating retention 
for subscription based products including our print newsletters  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and principia software  we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year 
for products sold through contracts and licenses  we use the contract value method  which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period 
we include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount  unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify 
we also include variable contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage 
the retention rate excludes setup and customization fees  migrations to other morningstar products  and contract renewals that were pending as of january  the year in review industry overview we monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis 
we use these insights to help inform our company strategy  product development plans  and marketing initiatives 
investment landscape  research  and data despite pronounced market volatility and a market downturn during the fourth quarter of  the us equity markets finished the year in positive territory 
morningstar s us market index  a broad market benchmark  ended the year with a total return  compared with in most markets outside of the united states finished the year with higher total returns versus the us market index 
the crisis in subprime mortgages caused extreme disruption in the financial markets beginning in late we believe that the impact of these problems in the financial services sector to date has been the most severe in areas such as mortgage lending  commercial banking  and investment banking  with less direct impact on asset management firms 
however  there could be a spillover effect on other areas as the financial services sector attempts to address issues relating to the subprime mortgage crisis  uncertain credit markets  and a slowing economy 
total us mutual fund assets increased to trillion as of december  based on data from the investment company institute ici  compared with trillion as of december  net new cash flows into hybrid funds and taxable bond funds increased over levels  but cash flows into equity funds were substantially lower 
the number of mutual funds declined slightly to  during  compared with about  the previous year 
the investment company institute estimates that about million households in the united states  or of all households  own mutual funds 
this total is down slightly from its peak in  but consistent with the levels shown over the past several years 
we believe continued asset growth and widespread usage of mutual funds is significant because a relatively large portion of morningstar s business has historically focused on this area 
however  this percentage has been declining as we ve expanded into equity research and other areas 
interest in alternative asset classes  such as hedge funds  remained strong during most of based on data from hedge fund research  which tracks asset flows into hedge funds  hedge funds had about billion in net inflows during  compared with billion in net inflows in hedge fund research estimates that total hedge fund industry assets increased to trillion as of december  a increase from year end based on data from cerulli associates  assets invested in separate accounts reached billion as of december   up from about billion as of year end based on morningstar s data  we estimate that total assets invested in variable annuities totaled about trillion as of december  assets in exchange traded funds etfs increased about to reach about billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  based on data from the ici 
during  the number of us based etfs increased to more than  compared with about previously 
etfs have gained share from mutual funds in some areas of the market and have also started being used in defined contribution plans  such as k s 
to meet greater investor demand for information on etfs  we have continued to increase analyst coverage in this area and now cover about etfs 
we re also planning to create a new cover page for the etf area of morningstar 
com and recently introduced a new report format for etfs 
in  we also saw significant investor interest and new product development in open end mutual funds that pursue alternative investment strategies  such as funds  which invest in traditional long only securities but also sell short a portion of their assets and use the proceeds to build additional long exposure 
we believe this trend signifies that the lines are blurring between traditional mutual funds registered under the investment company act and alternative investment strategies often used by hedge funds 
we believe we re well positioned to meet the need for information and analysis on complex investment strategies  and that our broad investment coverage also gives us an advantage in meeting this market need 
individual investor market based on research from nielsen netratings  total page views to retail investment web sites decreased in the fourth quarter of  with aggregate page views declining from the same period in however  some sites showed large increases and others posted declines 
overall  the number of unique users to retail investment web sites increased by about 
for morningstar 
com  both page views and unique users increased in the fourth quarter of from the same period in morningstar 
com continued to perform better than competing sites based on metrics such as time spent per visit and the number of pages viewed per visit 
financial advisor market in  demand for financial advisory services continued to rise  as an increasing percentage of investors have been working with advisors to plan their financial futures 
the independent advisor channel has had particularly strong growth over the past three years  based on research published by financial research corporation 
we believe this trend is important because our products are well suited to meet the needs of the independent financial advisors  and we have a strong market position in this growing area 
larger advisory firms have been continuing to prepare for the pending termination of the merrill lynch rule  which allowed brokerage firms to provide investment advice in exchange for an asset based fee 
we think this development is notable because we believe many broker dealers may shift their clients out of fee based brokerage accounts  which typically include various services  including investment advice  in exchange for an asset based fee 
we believe this highlights the ongoing regulatory complexity in the advisor segment 
in addition  it may lead to additional business opportunities for the investment advisory services we offer 
institutional market in the united states  there has been continuing debate about improving disclosure of fees and returns in k plans 
in july  the us house education and labor committee chairman submitted a bill that would require k plans to disclose more information to retirement plan participants each year  as well as provide for additional oversight by the department of labor 
we believe this development is important because it highlights the need for transparency in the retirement market 
the pension protection act of has led to more use of target date funds and other qualified default investment alternatives 
in addition  the pension protection act has led to more opportunities for retirement advice programs offered at the employer level 
we continue to expand our retirement advice offerings to meet this need  particularly in managed retirement accounts 
merger and acquisition activity continued in the industry in in may  thomson corporation and reuters entered into an agreement to form a combined company  thomson reuters 
pending regulatory approval  the two companies expect to complete the merger in the second quarter of we continue to monitor merger and acquisition activity in our industry because of its potential impact on our business 
as an industry wide trend  we continued to see strong interest in retirement income in a large number of investors are currently approaching retirement and making the transition from accumulating assets to drawing down their portfolios 
as a result  financial research corporation estimates that total assets invested in retirement income related products will total more than trillion over the next or years 
we have continued to develop products and services to meet this need  including target spending portfolios  annuitization programs  and retirement income planning tools 
worldwide markets in europe  many financial services companies have been preparing for the upcoming implementation date of the market in financial instruments directive mifid 
the directive took effect in november and obligates companies to be more transparent with clients and make efforts to provide better quality service to investors 
we believe morningstar is well positioned to help companies meet the new requirements because our services and products are already largely in line with mifid s objectives 
in germany  the legislature recently passed a tax rule that involves taxing long term capital gains of mutual funds starting in january investors holding funds of funds  however  will have some tax protection until they sell the fund 
in addition  insurance wrapped funds will be subject to different taxation rules that are more favorable than direct fund investments 
because of this change  we expect continued asset growth and product launches in insurance wrapped and funds of of funds products 
in canada  the traditional pension fund area continues to expand 
we believe that pension funds have a need for more information on the various asset classes they invest in and see opportunities for morningstar to add value in this area 
in addition  canadian regulators recently increased the age limits and annual contribution limits for several types of savings plans 
in new zealand  the government introduced a new kiwi saver retirement savings initiative in july and established a number of incentives  including government and compulsory employer contributions  that will start in april in japan  regulators implemented a new financial products law in september the new law entails more risk disclosure and suitability requirements  which we think is positive for the industry 
emerging markets across asia continued their strong growth in  and we ve continued to expand our presence to meet the need for investment information in markets such as china and india 
we are expanding our operations in india and plan to launch a web site for individual investors in performance summary the list below summarizes the key accomplishments and challenges that our management team has highlighted related to our performance we significantly increased our global presence 
we doubled our revenue outside the united states and expanded our global database to  investment vehicles 
part of this growth came from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s  which strengthened our brand in several international markets 
the integration was a big undertaking  and we accomplished it swiftly 
in december  we announced our plans to acquire several hemscott businesses 
we completed that acquisition on january  our investment consulting businesses both ibbotson associates and morningstar associates had a banner year  contributing about of our annual revenue growth 
we now have billion in assets under advisement 
revenue from asset based fees now makes up approximately of our consolidated revenue 
despite significant market volatility  we continued to see net inflows into the funds of funds on which we provide advisory services throughout most of however  our asset based revenue could be affected by a decline in the equity market 
we launched a host of new offerings  including morningstar site builder  which allows investment firms to integrate our tools and content into their web sites  advisor workstation office edition in the uk  morningstar advisor magazine  and a family of fixed income and commodity futures indexes 
we continued to invest in our analyst staff and now have stock and fund analysts around the world 
we began qualitative research coverage on open end investment companies and unit trusts in the uk and initial public offerings in the united states 
we strengthened our board with the addition of two new members  frank ptak  president and ceo of the marmon group  and william lyons  former president and ceo of american century companies 
we launched a retirement income strategist tool for financial advisors in late  but did not see strong demand in we believe there s a growing need for solutions that help investors manage their income during retirement  and we ve also developed several services for institutional clients within our investment consulting areas 
we expect our in retirement solutions to gain greater adoption in consolidated results change change revenue operating income operating margin pp pp cash used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow nmf not meaningful pp percentage point s as noted in how we evaluate our business  we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
we present free cash flow as a supplemental disclosure to help you better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
also  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years  comparing our financial results from year to year is complex 
to make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods  we provide information on both organic revenue  which includes our underlying business excluding acquisitions  and revenue from acquisitions 
we include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for months after we complete the acquisition 
after that  we include it as part of our organic revenue stream 
the table below shows the periods in and during which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions acquisition ibbotson associates  inc march through december  january through february  aspect huntley pty limited july through december  january through july  hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce  inc august through december  january through july  mutual fund data business from standard poor s march through december  consolidated revenue in  our consolidated revenue increased to million 
during  we had strong organic growth as well as new revenue from acquisitions  the majority of which was from the mutual fund data business we acquired from standard poor s in march as a whole  acquisitions contributed million  or percentage points  to our consolidated revenue growth in a slightly lower percentage compared with our consolidated revenue increased to million in from strong organic growth as well as new revenue from three key acquisitions ibbotson associates  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
adding these operations to our existing business contributed million of revenue  the majority of which was from ibbotson 
these acquisitions represented percentage points of our consolidated revenue growth in to give investors more insight on our company s underlying growth rate  we provide information about our organic revenue growth  which excludes revenue from acquisitions and foreign currency translations 
on this measure  we also performed well 
organic revenue growth was million  or  in  which was in line with our performance in consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations organic revenue is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under gaap 
the tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations organic revenue vs 
change consolidated revenue less acquisitions nmf less impact of foreign currency translations nmf revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations vs 
change consolidated revenue less acquisitions nmf less impact of foreign currency translations nmf revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations while organic revenue growth and acquisitions had the most significant impact on revenue in and  we also enjoyed a benefit from foreign currency translations in each year because of continued weakness in the us dollar 
in both and  our growth was diversified by segment  with all three segments contributing to revenue growth 
however  the institutional segment  which now makes up more than half of our consolidated revenue  generated approximately of our company wide revenue increase in acquisitions contributed million to institutional segment revenue in the institutional segment was also the main contributor to the revenue increase in  accounting for about of morningstar s total revenue increase before eliminating intersegment revenue 
acquisitions contributed million to institutional segment revenue in our two other segments also generated strong revenue growth 
advisor segment revenue rose million  or  in  accounting for approximately of the revenue increase before eliminating intersegment revenue 
acquisitions contributed million to the advisor segment revenue in advisor segment revenue rose approximately in compared with the full year of  with acquisitions contributing million of the revenue increase 
individual segment revenue increased million  or  in and million  or  in acquisitions contributed approximately million to the individual segment in and in graphic on a product level  investment consulting was the largest driver behind our revenue increase in and much of our business in this area focuses on asset allocation services that we provide for funds of funds  where we typically act as a portfolio consultant or portfolio construction manager 
we continued to see significant growth in assets under advisement from existing clients in both years 
changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance  and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios 
in both and  both factors contributed to growth in assets under advisement  but increases in net inflows were the main driver behind the asset growth 
in  the majority of the revenue increase was driven by organic revenue growth  which came from both morningstar associates and ibbotson associates 
in  newly added revenue from ibbotson s investment consulting business generated more than of the revenue growth in this product  with the remaining amount from morningstar s existing consulting business 
advisor workstation was the second largest driver of the organic revenue increase in and nearly of the growth in this product was driven by the enterprise edition  which we offer to financial advisors affiliated with larger firms 
advisor workstation office edition for independent financial advisors contributed the remainder 
total licenses for advisor workstation in the united states increased by about in part of this growth reflects changes in the scope of some contracts 
in  a few clients who previously held tools only contracts converted to full site licenses when they renewed their contracts 
for full site licenses  we include all affiliated advisors who have access to the site in our total license count 
by contrast  for tools only contracts  we include a smaller number of advisors in the total based on actual usage 
licensed data was the third largest contributor to organic revenue growth in this growth was driven by both new clients and higher contract values for existing clients 
including the impact of acquisitions  licensed data was also a major contributor to revenue growth  as product revenue now includes newly incorporated revenue from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s and aspect huntley s institutional database 
revenue from international operations continues to become a more important part of our business 
because the fund data business acquired from standard poor s has a strong presence in non us markets  this acquisition boosted our revenue outside the united states 
our non us revenue increased to of consolidated revenue in percentage points higher than in revenue from international operations grew million  or  to million in approximately half of this revenue increase came from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s 
revenue from non us operations increased million  or  to million in our acquisitions of aspect huntley and ibbotson contributed million of the increase 
in january  we completed our acquisition of several hemscott businesses from ipreo holdings llc 
because most of hemscott s revenue is from markets outside the united states  we expect our non us business to continue increasing as a percentage of total revenue 
foreign currency translations had a much smaller  but still favorable  impact on international revenue in both and foreign currency translations contributed million of the increase in non us revenue in and million in excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations  our non us revenue increased in and in the tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations international organic revenue vs

while the percentage of our revenue made up by our top five products has remained relatively consistent  the order of the products within the top five has changed each year

the following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past three years graphic in  we estimate that our retention rate for subscription based products  such as principia  premium membership service  and print and online newsletters  averaged between to  slightly higher than the level shown in for contract based products and services  we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between and in  which was consistent with the level in the figure for contract based products includes the impact of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal  as well as changes in the value of variable contracts 
the renewal rate for contract based products and services declined in compared with for three main reasons the impact of outstanding renewals in our data services business  our strategy of discontinuing some lower margin contracts in our retirement advice business  and a smaller increase in the number of incremental users added upon renewal in relative to for certain products  such as morningstar direct 
consolidated operating expense operating expense change of revenue change pp pp pp our consolidated operating expense increased million in compared with two primary factors impacted all of our operating expense categories compensation related costs  including incentive compensation expenses  and recent acquisitions 
compensation related expense  excluding bonuses  rose million because of an increase in headcount  as well as annual salary increases 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december  compared with approximately  as of december  approximately of the increase in headcount was from acquisitions and approximately one fourth of the increase was from continued hiring in our development center in china 
bonus expense was up million because of improvement in our financial performance  as well as increased headcount 
a majority of our bonus pool is based on growth in our operating income  which may or may not recur 
excluding compensation related expenses  general and administrative expense increased million in we incurred additional costs in our operations from our acquisitions 
some of these incremental costs included transition costs  rent and facilities expense  and professional fees 
we also incurred million of expense related to settling our australian litigation 
we also had higher amortization expense in because of our acquisitions 
this additional amortization expense contributed million to the operating expense increase in we expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost through the useful lives of these assets  which generally range from two to years 
in  our consolidated operating expense increased million compared with the previous year 
as in  two key factors impacted all of our operating expense categories compensation related costs including incentive compensation and recent acquisitions 
compensation related expense  mainly including salaries  benefits  and sales commissions  increased million in because of an increase in headcount  as well as annual salary increases 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   compared with approximately  as of december  about half of the increase in headcount was related to acquisitions  and a good portion of the remaining increase was from continued hiring in our development center in china 
bonus expense recorded in increased million because of continued improvements in our financial performance  as well as increased headcount 
lower stock based compensation expense partially offset increases in all of our operating expense categories in stock based compensation expense decreased million in because we are no longer required to record expense under the liability method 
in the first quarter of  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense under this method  which did not recur in in addition to higher compensation related expense  the increase in operating expense in included million of amortization expense for the intangible assets acquired with ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold change of revenue change pp pp gross profit change gross margin change pp pp pp cost of goods sold has generally been our largest category of operating expense  and that was the case again in our business relies heavily on human capital  and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services 
cost of goods sold increased million in approximately two thirds of the growth was due to higher compensation expense  including incentive compensation 
these costs rose because of continued hiring as well as additional headcount from acquisitions 
acquisitions contributed the largest portion of the remaining growth in this category s operating expense 
outsourced product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service were million lower in compared with  offsetting the increases in other expenses in this category 
cost of goods sold increased million in  which was mainly driven by higher bonus expense and other compensation related expense from increased headcount  as well as the million of outsourced product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
over the past three years  our gross margin has increased to in from in  as revenue growth has outpaced the increase in this expense category 
development expense development expense change of revenue change pp pp pp development expense increased million in although we continued to increase hiring for our programming and development staff in bonus costs included in this category increased at a lower rate than in during  we added about programmers and other technology staff  compared with in development expense as a percentage of revenue declined in  reversing the increase shown in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense change of revenue change pp pp pp sales and marketing expense rose million in and million in nearly of the increase was driven by added compensation expense from hiring for sales and marketing staff  mainly in our advisor and institutional segments 
higher commission expense and marketing costs  and  to a lesser extent  incentive compensation  also drove the increase in this cost category 
in  we significantly expanded our direct mail campaigns to promote annual publications such as the morningstar stocks  morningstar funds  morningstar etfs  and the stocks  bonds  bills and inflation yearbook  which are published in the first quarter 
these direct mail campaigns contributed to growth in marketing expense in the first nine months of incremental costs added by acquisitions also contributed to the growth in this category because of increases in headcount and the number of products and services sold 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense declined slightly in  but less so than in and general and administrative expense general and administrative expense change of revenue change pp pp pp general and administrative expense g a has generally been our second largest category of operating expense following cost of goods sold 
that pattern continued in and  but g a costs increased more dramatically in in  the million increase in g a was primarily driven by higher compensation and bonus expense 
in addition  we incurred additional costs in our operations outside the us primarily related to temporary transition costs associated with the fund data operations acquired from standard poor s  mainly in europe 
incremental costs from acquisitions in the united states  including rent and professional fees  also added to the increase in this category 
an expense of million related to settling our australian litigation also contributed to the increase in g a 
because of these increases  g a increased slightly as a percentage of revenue in  after declining significantly in and the increase in g a in of million was mainly driven by increases in incentive compensation and incremental expense added by acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  which dropped because we did not record any stock based compensation expense under the liability method in in addition  legal expense was essentially flat in overall  most costs included in this category rose at a lower rate than revenue  and general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue declined by about percentage points in we anticipate that g a costs will increase in because of duplicate rent expense as we move into our new corporate headquarters in chicago 
we anticipate that we will record rent expense on both our existing lease and the new lease for a period of about one year  resulting in additional rent expense 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense amortization expense total depreciation and amortization expense change of revenue change pp pp pp depreciation and amortization expense rose million in and million in the increase was almost entirely driven by amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of the mutual fund data business from standard poor s and the acquisitions of ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
as a percentage of revenue  this category of expense has increased in recent years primarily because amortization expense has become a higher fixed cost 
we expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in stock based compensation expense restricted stock units equity method stock options equity method stock options liability method stock based compensation expense change of revenue change pp pp pp we include stock based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories 
beginning in may  we began granting restricted stock units 
prior to may  we granted stock options 
our stock based compensation expense is determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  shared based payment sfas no 
r  which we adopted on january  we record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that ultimately vest 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense recorded since the beginning of reflects an estimate of an expected forfeiture rate 
prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we recorded stock based compensation expense in our financial statements using the previously applicable accounting guidance 
up through the date of our initial public offering in may  we used two different methods of accounting for employee stock options the liability method  which involves recording a liability for vested options equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair value per share of the common stock  and the equity method  which is based on the black scholes value of the option at the time of the grant and recorded over the vesting period of the option 
following our initial public offering in may  we are no longer required to settle stock options in cash  and therefore are no longer required to record stock based compensation expense under the liability method 
in  we reduced the estimated forfeiture rate for awards that haven t yet vested 
in addition  we make adjustments to stock based compensation expense following the vesting date to reflect only those awards that ultimately vested 
we made this adjustment in the second quarter  which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest 
these two factors accounted for million of additional stock based compensation expense in  the majority of which was recorded in the second quarter 
total stock based compensation expense declined million in  largely because we did not record any stock based compensation expense under the liability method 
stock based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units recorded under the equity method increased  but by only a small amount 
an increase in expense related to our annual equity grant in may  which consisted of restricted stock units  was substantially offset by lower expense recorded for stock options granted in previous years  as certain options became fully vested and no longer require us to record additional expense 
based on equity grants completed through december   we estimate that stock based compensation expense will be million in bonus expense bonus expense change of revenue change pp pp pp bonus expense recorded in increased million  which was slightly lower than the million increase in the increase in both years was driven by improved financial performance versus the prior year and incremental bonus expense from acquisitions 
we pay annual bonuses that are related to increases in our operating income and include bonus expense in each of our operating expense categories 
as a percentage of revenue  bonus expense decreased slightly in after increasing by about percentage points in compared with consolidated operating income operating income change operating margin change pp pp pp consolidated operating income increased million in despite incremental costs added by acquisitions  such as amortization of intangible assets and increased compensation related expense  our operating margin continued to improve because our revenue base expanded at a faster rate than operating expense 
the lower rate of growth in cost of goods sold and development expense  in particular  allowed us to realize operating leverage in our consolidated results 
we also realized operating leverage from revenue growth in products that have had slower growing costs  such as investment consulting  advisor workstation  licensed data  and morningstar 
com 
graphic although our operating income continued rising in  operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by a smaller amount compared with the two previous years because of the higher rate of growth in general and administrative costs as well as depreciation and amortization 
consolidated free cash flow we generated free cash flow of million in  reflecting cash provided by operating activities of approximately million offset in part by capital expenditures of million 
free cash flow increased by million in compared with  reflecting a million increase in cash provided by operating activities partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was the result of higher net income  adjusted for non cash items and an increase in accrued compensation and income taxes payable  partially offset by higher payments for taxes and bonuses 
we paid million more for income taxes than we did in our tax payments were reduced as a result of a million cash tax benefit we received related to the ibbotson acquisition  primarily related to the payments for the cancellation of ibbotson s stock options 
the tax benefit was fully used during in  we paid million more for bonuses than we did in in capital expenditures mainly consisted of leasehold improvements for our new office space in canada  europe  and australia  computer hardware to keep our operations up and running in the event of a disaster  and design and architectural fees related to the planned office space for our corporate headquarters and us operations 
we generated free cash flow of million in  reflecting cash provided by operating activities of million offset in part by capital expenditures of million 
free cash flow more than doubled compared with  primarily reflecting a million increase in cash provided by operating activities 
in addition  capital expenditures declined by approximately million compared with we spent less on leasehold improvements in after completing major build outs of our office space in london and china in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income  as well as a reduction in income tax payments and an increase in accrued compensation 
in  we paid million less for income taxes than we did in because of the cash tax benefit we received from the ibbotson acquisition 
free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was in  in  and in to provide investors with additional insight into our financial results  we provide a comparison between the increase in net income with the change in cash flow provided by operating activities change change net income adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities excess tax benefits in accordance with sfas no 
r depreciation and amortization expense stock based compensation expense all other non cash items included in net income changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions cash paid for bonuses cash paid for income taxes reduction of australian litigation reserve accounts receivable deferred revenue income taxes payable accrued compensation accounts payable and accrued liabilities all other cash provided by operating activities the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was million less than the million increase in net income 
non cash items included in net income were a primary driver of the difference between net income and cash provided by operations in we had an additional million of excess tax benefits primarily because of an increase in the number of stock options exercised and the higher stock price on the date of these exercises 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity  which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations 
in  we classified million of excess tax benefits as financing activities  compared with million in see the liquidity section for further discussion on these excess tax benefits 
this million was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  an increase in deferred taxes of million  and an increase in stock based compensation of million in an increase in net operating assets and liabilities working capital excluding cash drove the remainder of the difference between net income and cash provided by operations 
the primary contributors were higher cash paid for both income taxes and bonuses in the payment related to the australian litigation also impacted cash flow from operations in increases in accounts receivable and other assets combined with a reduction in the cash flow benefit from higher deferred revenue balances contributed to the lag between net income and cash from operations 
these factors were partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of increases in accrued compensation and income taxes payable 
the cash flow benefit associated with accrued compensation increased million  reflecting the increase in the size of the bonus liability 
this was partially offset by a million increase in the amount of cash paid for bonuses in compared with we anticipate making bonus payments of approximately million in the first quarter of  compared with million in the first quarter of we paid million more for income taxes in than we paid in primarily because of the cash tax benefit we received from the ibbotson acquisition in and to a lesser extent for taxes paid for our operations outside the united states 
this was partially offset by higher income taxes payable of million because of the increase in taxable income in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in outpaced the million increase in net income 
the increase in net income and a reduction in net operating assets and liabilities were the two main factors driving this trend 
the million reduction in working capital excluding cash was mainly caused by an increase in income taxes payable and accrued compensation 
the increase in income taxes payable reflects the increase in taxable income  mainly in the united states  and a million reduction in the amount of cash paid for income taxes in  as we were able to reduce income tax payments because of the cash tax benefit related to the cancellation of ibbotson s stock options 
the growth in accrued compensation reflects the increase in the size of the bonus liability partially offset by a million increase in the amount of cash paid for bonuses 
a reduction in non cash items included in net income partially offset these positive factors

in  revenue for the individual segment increased million compared with our acquisitions of aspect huntley and ibbotson contributed million to revenue  with aspect huntley contributing about of this incremental revenue 
growth in morningstar

com premium service has expanded steadily over the past three years to  as of december  from  as of december  and  as of december  in addition  consistent with the trend over the past few years  we moderately increased subscription prices for premium membership in both january and internet advertising sales growth was also strong in both years  increasing about in and in morningstar equity research  which primarily includes revenue related to the global analyst research settlement  was the second largest contributor to organic revenue growth for this segment in both and our revenue in this area benefited in and because we ve continued to increase the number of stocks we cover  leading to higher contract values for some of the agreements related to the settlement 
revenue related to the global analyst research settlement accounted for approximately one fifth of the segment s revenue 
the period covered by the global analyst research settlement will expire in july after the settlement period expires  the investment banks covered by it will no longer be required to provide independent investment research reports to their clients

in  operating income for the individual segment increased million compared with  and in operating income for this segment increased million compared with operating expense increased million and million in and  respectively  and includes the incremental operating expenses associated with the newly acquired aspect huntley and ibbotson operations included in this segment 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  the operating expense increase in both years was mainly driven by higher compensation related expense  particularly in cost of goods sold and sales and marketing 
hiring for our equity analyst team  whose compensation costs we include in cost of goods sold  contributed to this increase 
the team grew to analysts worldwide as of december   compared with as of december  and as of december  an increase in bonus expense in and particularly in cost of goods sold  also contributed to operating expense growth in both years 
additional marketing expense  reflecting significantly expanded direct mail campaigns in the first quarter of  also contributed to the increase in a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million in partially offset expense increases in despite the growth in operating income  the segment s margin declined by percentage points in compared with the previous year reflecting growth in operating expenses that outpaced the growth in revenue 
the margin decline was partially due to the lower margins associated with the aspect huntley operations 
an increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue  reflecting our significantly expanded direct mail campaigns in the first quarter of and the growth in sales staff  also contributed to the margin decline in the segment s margin improved by percentage points in compared with the decrease in stock based compensation expense in had a favorable impact on operating margin 
advisor segment our advisor segment focuses on products and services for financial advisors 
key products in this segment based on revenue are morningstar advisor workstation and morningstar principia 
advisor workstation is a web based investment planning system that provides financial advisors with a comprehensive set of tools for conducting their core business  including investment research  planning  and presentations 
advisor workstation is available in two editions the office edition for independent financial advisors and the enterprise edition for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms 
principia is our cd rom based investment research and planning software for financial advisors 
in addition  we offer morningstar managed portfolios  a fee based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund  exchange traded fund  and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons and risk levels that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax deferred accounts 
in   and  this segment represented  before intersegment eliminations    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 

gbiaijpg 
in  revenue for the advisor segment increased million compared with acquisitions contributed million of revenue in from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s and  to a lesser extent  from ibbotson and aspect huntley 
in  revenue for the advisor segment increased million compared with acquisitions contributed million of revenue in  primarily from sales of financial communications materials and advisor focused ibbotson software tools 
in both and  the increase in organic revenue was primarily driven by morningstar advisor workstation 
we continued to see expansion in licenses of the enterprise edition of morningstar advisor workstation 
the number of us licenses for morningstar advisor workstation increased to  as of december   compared with  as of december  and  as of december  part of this growth reflects expansions in the scope of some contracts to full site licenses where we include all eligible advisors in our total license count  from tools only licenses where we include a smaller number of advisors based on actual usage 
the increase in users from the prior year was also driven by the growth of users at existing clients and new clients 
in addition  we also experienced strong renewals for the product during and and several contracts that were scheduled to expire renewed at significantly higher price points  reflecting both higher user counts and an increase in the amount of functionality licensed 
morningstar managed portfolios also contributed to revenue growth in both and  but to a lesser degree than advisor workstation 
assets under management for morningstar managed portfolios rose to billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  and billion as of december  principia revenue was flat in and the number of subscriptions for principia was  as of december   up from  as of december  but down from  as of december  in march  we introduced two new principia modules  presentation education and asset allocation  which contributed to the increase in the number of subscriptions 
in  our operating income for this segment was million  an increase of million compared with in  operating income increased million compared with in both years  the increase in operating income reflects an increase in revenue partially offset by higher operating expense in all categories 
operating expense increased million  or  in compared with compensation related expense including incentive compensation and commissions  accounted for approximately of the increase in operating expense 
the remainder of the operating expense increase was from an increase in g a spending and higher expenses in cost of goods sold 
incremental costs added primarily from the mutual fund data business acquired from standard poor s also accounted for a portion of the increase across all cost categories 
operating expense increased million in compared with an increase in cost of goods sold was the biggest driver  contributing almost half of the expense increase in higher cost of goods sold partly reflects increased compensation costs from additional headcount 
in  an increase in bonus expense as well as incremental costs added by acquisitions were also major drivers behind the cost increase in this category 
the remaining operating expense growth in primarily reflects an increase in sales and marketing expense  driven by compensation related expense  including bonuses 
incremental costs added by acquisitions also contributed to expense growth in all categories 
a million decrease in stock based compensation in lowered operating expense and contributed to the improvement in operating income 
operating margin was for  a decline of percentage points compared with in  the operating income was positively impacted by million of revenue from the elimination of a redundant license following the merger of two clients  no similar transaction occurred in this revenue added about percentage point to the segment s operating margin in without the favorable effect of this revenue in the previous year  the segment s operating margin would have increased slightly year over year 
our operating margin improved by percentage points in  to  reflecting the impact of higher revenue against a smaller rate of increase in operating expense 
operating margin growth was partly driven by advisor workstation enterprise edition  revenue for this product has grown at a more rapid pace than operating expense 
a decrease in stock based compensation in and the revenue from eliminating a redundant license following the merger of two clients also had a positive impact on the operating margin 
institutional segment our institutional segment focuses on products and services for institutions  including banks  insurance companies  mutual fund companies  brokerage firms  media firms  and retirement plan providers and sponsors 
key products and services in this segment based on revenue are investment consulting  which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds  including mutual funds and variable annuities  licensed data  a set of investment data spanning ten core databases  available through electronic data feeds  retirement advice  including the morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson platforms  morningstar direct  a web based institutional research platform that provides advanced research and tools on the complete range of securities in morningstar s global database  the institutional workstation product acquired from standard poor s  licensed tools and content  a set of online tools and editorial content designed for institutions to use in their web sites and software  and morningstar encorr  an asset allocation software package 
the institutional segment made up   and of our consolidated revenue before intersegment eliminations in   and  respectively 
we expect that the institutional segment will continue to account for the largest portion of our consolidated revenue for the foreseeable future 

gbiaijpg 
in  revenue for the institutional segment increased million compared with acquisitions contributed million of revenue to this segment in  primarily from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s  and to a lesser extent from ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
in  revenue for the institutional segment increased million compared with acquisitions contributed million of revenue to this segment in  mainly from investment consulting services and morningstar encorr  both from the ibbotson acquisition 
for the segment overall  on a product level  the increase in revenue in both and was driven by investment consulting  which contributed about and of the total increase in segment revenue in and  respectively 
in  more than of the increase in investment consulting revenue was contributed by newly incorporated revenue from ibbotson 
in both and  revenue increased because of substantial growth in assets under advisement mainly among existing clients 
we provided advisory services on approximately billion in assets compared with billion as of december  and approximately billion in assets as of december  as of december assets under advisement for investment consulting billions ibbotson associates n a morningstar associates total we acquired ibbotson associates in march these totals include consulting relationships as well as agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis point fee 
in addition  we also provide investment consulting services for some assets under management for which we receive a flat fee 
changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance  and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios 
in both and  both factors contributed to growth in assets under advisement  but increases in net inflows were the main driver behind the asset growth 
excluding revenue from acquisitions  licensed data and morningstar direct were the next largest contributors to revenue growth in both and both products have benefited from expanded sales efforts in europe and other markets outside the united states  as well as continued strength in the united states 
the number of licenses for morningstar direct increased to  worldwide as of december   compared with  as of december  and as of december  retirement advice  encorr  and licensed tools and content were also contributors to revenue growth during  although to a lesser extent 
the ibbotson acquisition significantly expanded our asset base in managed retirement accounts  and we are now one of the largest providers in this area 
as of december assets under management in managed retirement accounts billions advice by ibbotson n a morningstar retirement manager total the tables below show the breakdown of retirement plan participants who had access to the services offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson  as well as the number of plan sponsors and plan providers that provide this access 
as of december plan participants millions advice by ibbotson n a morningstar retirement manager total plan sponsors approximate advice by ibbotson n a morningstar retirement manager total plan providers advice by ibbotson n a morningstar retirement manager total in  operating income for the institutional segment increased million  or  compared with  in the segment s operating income increased million  or  compared with the increase in operating income in both years was primarily driven by revenue growth in investment consulting and licensed data 
asset based fees in investment consulting have increased while the cost base for this service has increased at a lower rate 
operating expense increased approximately million in and million in compensation related expenses and incremental costs added by acquisitions were the main contributors to the increase in this expense category in operating expenses associated with our acquired businesses contributed a significant portion of the operating expense increase in these additional expenses are included throughout the expense categories  but had the largest impact on compensation expense 
compensation and bonus expense  including compensation expense from our acquired businesses  made up about of the increase in operating expense 
the operating expense increase in was partially offset by a million reduction in product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service 
in  the increase in expense was largely driven by cost of goods sold  which contributed about of the expense increase in incremental costs added by acquisitions contributed to the increase in this expense category 
in addition  a large portion of incremental headcount from acquisitions was added to the institutional segment  which contributed to higher compensation and bonus expense in this category 
compensation related costs excluding acquisitions increased because of added headcount and higher bonus expense 
the remaining increase in operating expense in were spread across the other expense categories and reflects higher compensation and bonus expense as well as incremental expense added from acquisitions 
a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense partially offset these expense increases 
our operating margin improved percentage points in and percentage points in  reflecting the impact of revenue growth that exceeded the increase in operating expense  largely driven by continued growth in higher margin services  such as investment consulting 
product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service represented approximately of revenue in compared with of revenue in the previous year 
in addition  some of our acquired operations had a positive effect on the operating margin in corporate and eliminations this category includes amortization expense related to intangible assets 
these intangible assets are mainly recorded when we allocate the purchase price for acquisitions 
in addition  this category includes capitalized internal product development costs which result in a reduction of expense and related amortization expense 
the following table shows the components of corporate and eliminations expense that impacted our consolidated operating income amortization expense depreciation expense other corporate items and eliminations change in and  corporate items and eliminations increased almost entirely because of additional amortization expense related to intangible assets from acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets increased million in and million in we made four key acquisitions during the past two years 
as part of these acquisitions  we assigned million to intangible assets other than goodwill 
we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated lives  ranging from two to years 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in depreciation expense included in this category has declined over the past three years as computer equipment and internal product development costs  capitalized in previous years  are now fully depreciated 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  non operating income  and income tax expense equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities primarily includes our portion of the net income loss of morningstar japan kk mjkk  morningstar korea  ltd  morningstar danmark a s  and morningstar sweden ab 
in both and  equity in net income of unconsolidated entities was primarily from our equity earnings from mjkk 
in  mjkk recorded a gain related to the sale of shares in a subsidiary s initial public offering 
our share of the pre tax gain was approximately million 
for more information about our investments in unconsolidated entities  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
non operating income the following table presents the components of net non operating income interest income  net other income expense  net non operating income net interest income primarily reflects interest from our investment portfolio 
net interest income increased million and million during and  respectively 
we generated more interest income because of higher balances for cash  cash equivalents  and investments in compared with  as well as higher returns on these invested balances 
other income expense mainly consists of foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our non us operations  unrealized and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio  and royalty income from mjkk 
the increase in other expense in and was primarily related to foreign currency exchange losses 
income tax expense the following table summarizes the components of our effective income tax rate income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities total income tax expense effective income tax rate for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in  our effective income tax rate is influenced by three primary factors us state income taxes  the reported income or loss of our non us entities and our evaluation of the realizability of their net operating losses  and the impact of specific tax planning strategies 
incentive stock options also influenced our effective tax rate in  but to a much lesser extent than in previous years 
in  our effective income tax rate increased percentage points compared with the previous year 
approximately half of the increase was because of an increase to our overall us state tax rate and additional state income tax expense related to a change in state tax law enacted in as a result of this tax law change  we expect to realize a lower tax benefit when we use our net deferred tax assets in future periods 
we therefore reduced the value of our deferred tax assets and recorded a corresponding increase to income tax expense as of the date of enactment 
we expect the enacted tax law change will have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate starting in the remainder of the increase in our effective tax rate was because of an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 
certain positions we have taken or intend to take on our us and non us tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in  our effective income tax rate was  which is comparable to our effective income tax rate in this rate  however  reflects three items related to our non us operations 
our effective income tax rate includes additional income tax expense outside the united states recorded in the second quarter of this additional income tax expense increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in addition  in we paid withholding taxes in non us jurisdictions for which we do not anticipate receiving a credit for us income tax purposes 
these withholding taxes increased our effective rate by approximately half of a percentage point 
these increases were mostly offset by the benefit we recorded as a result of reducing previously recorded deferred tax valuation allowances 
based on the evidence related to certain of our non us entities  we concluded it was more likely than not that we would be able to use the accumulated net operating losses 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards of million related to our non us operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but million of these nols as of december  because of the historical operating losses for certain non us operations  a valuation allowance is required because we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use all of our non us nols 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate may continue to fluctuate related to the creation or reversal of valuation allowances for our non us operations as well as to changes in unrecognized tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our available cash balances and investments  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents  and investments for general corporate purposes  including working capital  and for funding future growth 
cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  an increase of million compared with the balance as of december  during  we were able to generate sufficient cash to more than offset payments related to acquisitions  bonuses  income taxes  and capital expenditures 
we also had sufficient cash on hand as of december  to cover the costs of the acquisition of the hemscott businesses from ipreo holdings llc in early january and our annual bonus payments in february 
gbiaijpg 
cash provided by operating activities our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
the increase of million  or  in operating cash flow was the result of higher net income  adjusted for non cash items and an increase in accrued compensation and income taxes payable  partially offset by higher tax payments and higher bonus payments 
although our net income adjusted for non cash items increased by million  changes in our net operating assets and liabilities slightly reduced the cash flow benefit from net income 

gbiaijpg 
the million growth in accrued compensation reflects a million increase in the size of the bonus liability partially offset by a million increase in the amount of cash paid for bonuses 
in february  we made approximately million of bonus payments that were accrued as of december  in  we made bonus payments of million 
we anticipate making bonus payments of approximately million in the first quarter of for bonuses accrued as of december  the benefit to cash flow from operations related to income taxes was lower in compared with payments for income taxes increased million while income taxes payable increased by million 
in  our tax payments were reduced primarily because of the cash tax benefit we received from the ibbotson acquisition in this income tax benefit  primarily related to the payments for the cancellation of ibbotson s stock options  was fully used during  reducing the amount we paid for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net income tax receivable of million 
our estimated tax payments made during could not predict the volume of stock option exercises which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of and the value of excess tax benefits related to these option exercises 
in  we generated million of excess tax benefits  more than half of which were generated in the fourth quarter 
we will use this tax receivable to offset the future income tax liabilities  primarily in the united states 
the payment related to the australian litigation also reduced the cash flow from operations in we paid a cash settlement of australian million million 
this amount was higher than the previously recorded reserve of australian  approximately us million at the settlement date 
approximately million of this payment reduced our cash flow from operations  with the remainder included in cash used for investing activities reflecting an adjustment to the goodwill we initially recorded when we acquired morningstar research pty ltd morningstar australia in in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
the increase of million  or  in operating cash flows mainly reflects increases in net income  income taxes payable  and accrued compensation 
in  we made million of income tax payments  compared with million in as part of the ibbotson purchase price allocation  we recorded a reduction to income taxes payable of million 
this cash income tax benefit did not impact our income tax expense or net income in  but lowered the cash paid for income taxes in accrued compensation increased primarily because of an increase in accrued bonuses 
cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions  purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments  and capital expenditures 
the level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories 
in  cash used for investing activities decreased million  compared with  primarily reflecting a decrease in cash used for acquisitions partially offset by an increase in net purchases of investments and a greater amount of spending on capital expenditures 
in  cash used for investing activities increased million compared with  primarily reflecting an increase in cash used for acquisitions 
cash used for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million in cash used for acquisitions also includes transaction costs directly related to the acquisitions 
the majority of the cash used for acquisitions in relates to our acquisition of the fund data business acquired from standard poor s 
in we also paid cash to acquire the remaining share ownership in morningstar europe nv and made the final payment related to the aspect huntley acquisition 
cash used for acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
this total includes cash used to purchase ibbotson in march  aspect huntley in july  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce in august in  cash used for acquisitions was million  related to our january acquisition of the variable annuity research and data service from finetre corporation 
purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  of and million  respectively 
as of both december  and  our investments represented approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
capital expenditures are primarily for leasehold improvements  computer hardware  and computer software 
we anticipate that in  our capital expenditures will be significantly higher than in previous years primarily because of the build out of our new office space in chicago for our us based operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in  including approximately million for the build out of the new office space 
a portion of the capital expenditures will be offset by tenant improvement allowances which will reduce the total amount of cash we will need to pay for the build out 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant 
similarly  excess tax benefits are generated upon vesting of restricted stock units when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units 
these excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized 
it is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises nor the intrinsic value which will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units 
as a result  cash flow from financing activities is expected to vary over time 
note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december  in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
we received proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
we also recorded million for excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
in  cash provided by financing activities increased by million  or  compared with  driven almost entirely by an additional million of excess tax benefits 
the increase was due to a larger number of stock options exercised and the stock price on the date of these exercises 
in  employees exercised approximately million stock options compared with million options exercised in the total intrinsic value difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option of options exercised during and was million and million  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities of million increased million  or  and primarily reflected an increase of million in proceeds from stock option exercises 
stock option exercises continued to increase in  our first full year as a public company

application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
if actual amounts are different from previous estimates  we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications  software  and internet based products and services 
we recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we also provide analysis  consulting  retirement advice  and other services 
we recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition  including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable 
for contracts that combine multiple products and services  we make judgments regarding the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately 
delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue 
if arrangements include an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the receipt of written customer acceptance 
deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions  licenses  or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
as of december   our deferred revenue was million 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations 
the amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions 
the timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling of our service obligations 
we believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate  and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
purchase price allocation over the past several years  we have acquired companies that complement our business operations 
in  we acquired the mutual fund data business from standard poor s 
in  we acquired ibbotson associates  aspect huntley  and the database division of investorforce 
in  we acquired vards 
over the past three years  the total cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was approximately million 
for each acquisition  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
we recognized the assets and liabilities acquired related to these acquisitions at their estimated fair values and as of december  had allocated million of value to intangible assets such as customer lists  intellectual property  technology  non competition agreements  and supplier lists 
for these intangible assets  the estimated useful lives range from two to years 
as of december   we also have recorded million of goodwill arising from acquisitions 
management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities 
we use judgment to identify the acquired assets  estimate the fair value of these assets  estimate the useful life of the assets  and assess the appropriate method for recognizing depreciation or amortization expense over the asset s useful life 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets  the amount of amortization and depreciation expense  if any  recorded in our consolidated statements of income  and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods 
goodwill goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  it is subject to at least an annual test for impairment  or whenever indicators of impairment exist  based on a discounted cash flow model 
an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long term horizon 
we update these assumptions and cash flow estimates annually  at a minimum 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units included in our segments 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
this would result in a non cash charge  adversely affecting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes property  equipment  and capitalized software of million and intangible assets of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  equipment  capitalized software  and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events or changes may include a deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
they are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  as of january  under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
in  we granted both stock options and restricted stock units to employees 
in  our equity grants were almost exclusively in the form of restricted stock units 
we measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant 
we measure the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 
rather  different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period 
because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year  we adjust the stock based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested 
in addition  we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested 
in  we recorded approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense related to these changes in estimates 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our us and us entities which are part of our consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 
as of december   we had million of net current deferred tax liabilities and million of net long term deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets include amounts related to net operating loss nol carryforwards 
as of december   we have nols of million related to our non us operations 
because of the historical operating losses of certain of the non us operations that generated these nols  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately million of the nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause our income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
we assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we use judgment to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return 
we adjust these liabilities  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
we use judgment in classifying unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits will generally be classified as a noncurrent liability because there will usually be a period of several years between the filing of the tax return and the final resolution of an uncertain tax position with the taxing authority 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations 
refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties  and government actions 
judgment is required as we assess the probability of loss for such contingencies and either accrue a liability or disclose the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual results differ from our assessments  our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would be impacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates  market prices  or adverse security selection 
our investment portfolio is mainly invested in high quality fixed income securities 
we do not have any direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and investments balance was million 
based on our estimates  a basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately million 
as our non us revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue  fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging  and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk 
our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the us dollar 
in addition  because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars
