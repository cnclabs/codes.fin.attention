item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
see the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of part i of the annual report on form k 
overview we are a mall based specialty retailer of action sports related apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories operating under the zumiez brand name 
as of february  we operated stores primarily located in shopping malls  giving us a presence in states 
we were founded in by thomas d 
campion  our chairman 
our current president and chief executive officer  richard m 
brooks  joined us as chief financial officer in our stores cater to young men and women between the ages of and who seek popular brands representing a lifestyle centered on activities that include skateboarding  surfing  snowboarding  bmx and motocross 
we support the action sports lifestyle and promote our brand through a multi faceted marketing approach that is designed to integrate our brand image with our customers activities and interests 
this approach  combined with our differentiated merchandising strategy  store design  comprehensive training programs and passionate employees  allows us to provide an experience for our customers that we believe is consistent with their attitudes  fashion tastes and identities and is otherwise unavailable in most malls 
our net sales increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of 
net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  over net sales for fiscal over the past five fiscal years ended february  we increased our store base from to and our comparable store net sales increased an average of per fiscal year 
as of february  we operated stores that averaged approximately  square feet per store 
we intend to expand our presence as a leading action sports lifestyle retailer by opening new stores and continuing to generate sales growth through improved store level productivity 
we have successfully and consistently implemented our store concept across a variety of mall classifications and geographic locations  and our strategy is to continue to open stores in both new and existing markets 
we plan to open new stores in fiscal and to continue to open a significant number of new stores in future years 
through our merchandising and marketing efforts  we have generally been successful in increasing the level of net sales in our existing stores and we will seek to continue such increases going forward 
we believe that we have developed an economically compelling store model 
our new stores opened during fiscal  including stores  net  acquired from fast forward  generated average net sales of approximately million during their first full year of operations 
on average  our net investment to open these stores  excluding the fast forward stores  was approximately  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions 
however  net sales and other operating results for stores that we open or have opened subsequent to the end of fiscal  as well as our net investment to open those stores  may differ substantially from net sales and other operating results and our net investment for stores we opened in fiscal see business stores 
we opened new stores in fiscal with an average net investment of approximately  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions 
however  our net investment to open new stores and net sales generated by new stores vary significantly and depend on a number of factors  including the geographic location  type of mall and size of those stores 
accordingly  net sales and other operating results for stores that we open or have opened subsequent to the end of fiscal  as well as our net investment to open those stores  may differ substantially from net sales and other operating results and our net investment for the stores we opened in fiscal in any given period  our overall gross margin may be impacted by changes in the margins of the various products we offer as well as changes in the relative mix of revenues from the different categories of apparel and hardgood products that we sell 
over the past five fiscal years  our annual gross margin as a percentage of our net sales has ranged from a low of to a high of 
we achieved these results while continuing to adjust our merchandise mix to respond to changing consumer preferences and market conditions 
a number of other factors may also positively or negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations  including  but not limited to the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  whether we are able to successfully integrate any new stores that we acquire and the presence or absence of any unanticipated liabilities in connection therewith  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  actions by competitors or mall anchor tenants  weather conditions  the level of pre opening expenses associated with our new stores  and inventory shrinkage beyond our historical average rates  one of our ongoing goals is to leverage our expenses  particularly general corporate overhead and fixed costs such as non variable occupancy costs  through increases in both comparable store sales and total net sales 
at the store level  our strategy is to increase comparable store sales in an effort to improve operating results by spreading our store level fixed costs over increased net sales per comparable store 
we also seek to increase our total net sales  both through increases in comparable store sales and by opening new stores  in an effort to better leverage our corporate level expenses and decrease our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales 
general net sales constitute gross sales net of returns 
net sales include our in store sales and our internet sales and  accordingly  information herein with respect to comparable store sales  net sales per store and net sales per square foot includes our internet sales 
for fiscal through fiscal  internet sales represented approximately of our annual net sales 
we record the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognize a sale when a customer redeems a gift card 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
we report comparable store sales based on net sales  and stores are included in our comparable store sales beginning on the first anniversary of their first day of operation 
changes in our comparable store sales between two periods are based on net sales of stores which were in operation during both of the two periods being compared and  if a store is included in the calculation of comparable store sales for only a portion of one of the two periods being compared  then that store is included in the calculation for only the comparable portion of the other period 
when additional square footage is added to a store that is included in comparable store sales  that store remains in comparable store sales 
there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 
cost of goods sold consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound shipping costs  distribution costs  depreciation on leasehold improvements at our distribution center  buying and merchandising costs and store occupancy costs 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of goods sold 
in early february we completed our move from the  square foot combined home office and distribution center we had leased since to a newly leased  square foot combined home office and distribution center 
in october  we entered into a new lease agreement whereby we agreed to expand our existing lease of  square feet of home office and distribution center space by  square feet  bringing the aggregate square footage leased to  square feet 
the effective date of the new lease was january  the new lease agreement terminated and replaced the original february lease with the landlord 
the new lease agreement provides for an initial lease term of months within which we have an option to extend the lease term for an additional period of five years 
as a result  we experienced a slight increase in our distribution and warehousing costs  which are included as a component of our costs of goods sold  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of store personnel wages and benefits  administrative staff and infrastructure expenses  store supplies  depreciation on leasehold improvements at our home office and stores  facility expenses  and training  advertising and marketing costs 
credit card fees  insurance  public company expenses  sarbanes oxley compliance expenses  stock based compensation and other miscellaneous operating costs are also included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will  as described below  increase in future periods due in part to increased expenses associated with opening new stores 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  share based payments granted in future periods will increase compensation expense that would otherwise have been recognized in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and outstanding unvested options will result in additional compensation expense that otherwise would only have been recognized on a pro forma basis 
for more information regarding the implementation of sfas r  see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demands 
any inability to provide appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company  which will adversely affect our results of operations  perhaps materially 
among other things  we expect that continued compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules and regulations will result in significant legal and accounting costs in the future 
see item a risk factors 
we may take steps  such as increased promotional activities  to increase the percentage of net sales of private label merchandise in the future  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve increases in private label merchandise sales as a percentage of net sales 
because our private label merchandise generally carries higher gross margins than other merchandise  our failure to anticipate  identify and react in a timely manner to fashion trends with our private label merchandise  particularly if the percentage of net sales derived from private label merchandise increases  may have a material adverse effect on our comparable store sales  financial condition and results of operations

gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million compared with million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to the increase in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal  which allowed us to leverage certain fixed costs  over greater total net sales  improved pricing from some of our vendors due to our larger merchandise purchases and reduced freight costs  distribution costs and buying costs as a percentage of net sales

as a percentage of net sales  net income was in fiscal compared with in fiscal seasonality and quarterly results as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences 
as a result  we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  while the winter holiday and back to school periods historically have accounted for the largest percentage of our annual net sales 
quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  changes in merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions  competition and weather conditions 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and includes all adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
the operating results for any fiscal quarter are not indicative of the operating results for a full fiscal year or for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trend reflected in such results will continue in the future 
fiscal year ended february  fiscal year ended february  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data net sales      gross profit      operating profit      net income       basic net income per share dilute net income per share number of stores open end of period comparable store sales increase note significant accounting policies for cost of goods sold reclassification of shipping costs 
comparable store sales percentage changes are calculated by comparing comparable store sales for the applicable fiscal quarter to comparable store sales for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year 
comparable store sales are based on net sales and stores are considered comparable beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of operations 
see general above for more information about how we compute comparable store sales 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for capital investments  inventory  store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements such as technology enhancements and distribution capabilities 
historically  our main sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in may  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in which we sold  shares and certain selling shareholders sold  shares 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million  after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
since the completion of the offering  we have used all of the net proceeds of the offering to pay down balances on our line of credit  to fund capital expenditures associated with opening new stores  and to fund the fast forward acquisition 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling shareholders 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  marketable securities and receivables  specifically credit card receivables  reduced by short term debt  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale  while we typically have payment terms with our vendors 
at the end of fiscal we held two auction rate securities totaling million or of our investment portfolio 
we currently do not intend to hold these securities beyond their auction date and will try to sell these securities when their auction dates come up in march and may  respectively 
however  the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
if the auctions fail  we plan to hold these securities until the next auction date and the securities coupon rate will reset to a prescribed failure rate 
unsuccessful auctions could result in our holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates if a secondary market does not develop  therefore  limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
our capital requirements include construction and fixture costs related to the opening of new stores and for maintenance and remodeling expenditures for existing stores 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of new store openings  the availability of suitable locations for new stores  and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords 
in that regard  our net investment to open a new store has varied significantly in the past due to a number of factors  including the geographic location and size of the new store  and is likely to vary significantly in the future 
during fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures  a majority of which will relate to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the new stores we plan to open in fiscal  and a smaller amount will relate to equipment  systems and improvements for our distribution center and support infrastructure 
however  there can be no assurance that the number of stores that we actually open in fiscal will not be different from the number of stores we plan to open  or that actual fiscal capital expenditures will not differ from this expected amount 
we expect cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
beyond this time frame  if cash flows from operations  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current shareholders 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the change was primarily due to an increase in net income  offset by an increase in inventory needed to support new stores and a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of inventory receipts and associated payment in the fourth quarter 
in addition  fiscal cash flow provided by operating activities benefited due to parts of washington being declared a federal disaster area due to severe weather in the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with the presidential disaster area tax relief  we deferred our federal income tax payment of million from january to february this positively impacted fiscal s cash flow provided by operations and negatively impacted fiscal s cash flow provided by operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store renovations and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  primarily related to capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store renovations  the acquisition of the fast forward stores for million and net purchases of marketable securities of million and million in fiscal  primarily related to net purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store renovations 
net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal was million  primarily related to proceeds from stock option exercise and associated tax benefits 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily related to proceeds from stock option exercise and the associated tax benefit and short term use of bank funds 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily related to proceeds from our initial public offering on may  we have a credit agreement with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na the credit agreement provides us with a secured revolving credit facility until august  of up to million 
this facility replaces our million secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  which terminated effective august  the secured revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of standby commercial letters of credit in an amount not to exceed million outstanding at any time and with a term not to exceed days  although the amount of borrowings available at any time under our secured revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit outstanding at that time 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility at february  or february  the company had open letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility of million at february  and approximately million at february  the secured revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates based on the lower of the prime rate at february  minus or the libor rate at february   plus for advances over  for a minimum of days and a maximum of days 
the credit agreement contains a number of restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  undergo a change in ownership and enter into certain transactions 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain specified financial tests and ratios  including  minimum net income after taxes  maximum total liabilities divided by tangible net worth and minimum quick asset ratio 
all of our personal property  including  among other things  our inventory  equipment and fixtures  has been pledged to secure our obligations under the credit agreement 
we must also provide financial information and statements to our lender 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at february  contractual obligations and commercial commitments there was no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the fiscal year ended february  our operating lease obligations are not recognized as liabilities in the financial statements 
the following table summarizes the total amount of future payments due under certain of our contractual obligations and the amount of those payments due in future periods as of february  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   letters of credit we occupy our retail stores and combined home office and distribution center under operating leases generally with terms of five to ten years 
some of our leases have early cancellation clauses  which permit the lease to be terminated by us if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods 
some leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to five years under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases 
in addition to future minimum lease payments  substantially all of our store leases provide for additional rental payments or percentage rent if sales at the respective stores exceed specified levels  as well as the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in the above table do not include percentage rent  common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes 
most of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions  which we have straight lined over the term of the lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
for certain locations  we receive cash tenant allowances and we have reported these amounts as a deferred liability which is amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
rent expense  including common area maintenance and other occupancy costs  was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
at february   we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for approximately million 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment 
at february   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
off balance sheet obligations our only off balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february  related to operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
we have excluded these items from our balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we presently do not have any non cancelable purchase commitments 
at february  we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be financed by cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment 
at february  we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales or operating results for the past three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
we believe  given current facts and circumstances that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets  prepaid assets  goodwill and certain liabilities 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas revenue recognition and sales returns reserve 
we recognize revenue upon purchase by customers at our retail store locations or upon shipment for orders placed through our website as both title and risk of loss have transferred 
we offer a return policy of generally days and we accrue for estimated sales returns based on our historical sales returns results 
the amounts of these sales returns reserves vary during the year due to the seasonality of our business 
actual sales returns could be higher or lower than our estimated sales returns due to customer buying patterns that could differ from historical trends 
valuation of merchandise inventories 
we carry our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market 
merchandise inventories may include items that have been written down to our best estimate of their net realizable value 
our decisions to write down our merchandise inventories are based on our current rate of sale  the age of the inventory and other factors 
actual final sales prices to our customers may be higher or lower than our estimated sales prices and could result in a fluctuation in gross margin 
historically  any additional write downs have not been significant and we do not adjust the historical carrying value of merchandise inventories upwards based on actual sales experience 
leasehold improvements and equipment 
we review the carrying value of our leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset or group of assets 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques  such as the expected present value of future cash flows 
the actual economic lives of these assets may be different than our estimated useful lives  thereby resulting in a different carrying value 
these evaluations could result in a change in the depreciable lives of those assets and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
declines in projected store cash flow could result in the impairment of assets 
lease accounting 
the company occupies its retail stores and combined home office and distribution center under operating leases generally with terms of five to ten years 
some of these leases have early cancellation clauses  which permit the lease to be terminated if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods 
some leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to five years under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases 
most of the store leases require payment of a specified minimum rent  plus a contingent rent based on a percentage of the store s net sales in excess of a specified threshold 
most of the lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions  which are straight lined over the term of the related lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
the company straight lines and recognizes its rent expense over the term of the lease  plus the construction period prior to occupancy of the retail location  using a mid month convention 
for certain locations  the company receives cash tenant allowances and has reported these amounts as a deferred liability which is amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed  recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets 
to the extent that future recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense will be included within the tax provision in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
based on our history of operating earnings  no valuation allowance has been recorded as of february  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
as described in note to the financial statements  recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on february  the company s policy is to recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations for the year ended february  provisions for income taxes are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  under provisions of staff accounting bulletin n sab using the modified prospective method of transition 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under the stock incentive plan is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
using the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized beginning with the effective date of adoption of sfas no 
r for all share based issuances i granted after the effective date of adoption and ii granted prior to the effective date of adoption and after our initial public offering on may  prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related interpretations 
under the provisions of apb  no compensation expense was recognized when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of grant 
we recorded million of total stock based compensation expense for the year ended february  of which million was attributable to the board of directors as required by the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the stock based compensation expense is calculated on an accelerated method over the vesting periods of the related options 
this charge had no impact on our reported cash flows at february  there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options of which approximately million was attributable to the board of directors 
this cost is expected to be recognized on a weighted average basis over a period of approximately eight years 
we account for unvested stock based employee compensation arrangements granted prior to our initial public offering on the intrinsic value method as allowed by sfas r 
business acquisition 
in june  we completed the acquisition of of the ownership of action concepts fast forward  ltd 
a limited partnership fast forward  an apparel and accessory retail sales company which operated stores in texas  in oklahoma and in california 
the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values 
the company incurred transaction expenses of approximately  related to the employee severance and transition expense of the acquisition 
as of february   this amount has been paid in full

 business combinations sfas 
sfas r retains the underlying concepts of sfas in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting but sfas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  non controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas r would also apply the provisions of sfas r 
early adoption is not permitted

risk factors  issues and uncertainties please refer to the information set forth under item a above for a discussion of risk factors  issues and uncertainties that our business faces 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are susceptible to market value fluctuations with regard to our short term investments 
however  due to the relatively short maturity period of those investments and our intention and ability to hold those investments until maturity  the risk of material market value fluctuations is not expected to be significant 
during different times of the year  due to the seasonality of our business  we have borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interests at floating rates based either on the prime rate or libor  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at february  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates did not have a material effect on the results of operations in we do not believe that potential interest rate fluctuations will materially effect the fiscal results of operations
