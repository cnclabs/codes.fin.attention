disciplined acquisition program we selectively pursue opportunities to acquire additional printing businesses at reasonable prices 
some of these acquisitions may include smaller and or distressed printing businesses for consolidation into one of our existing businesses

best practices benchmarking we provide a forum for our printing businesses to share their knowledge of technical processes and their best practices with one another  as well as benchmark financial and operational data to help our printing businesses identify and respond to changes in operating trends 
leadership development through our unique leadership development program  we develop talent for future sales and management positions at our printing businesses 
our printing businesses maintain their own sales  customer service  estimating and planning  prepress  production and accounting departments 
our corporate headquarters staff provides support to our printing businesses in such areas as human resources  purchasing  internal financial controls design and management information systems 
we also maintain centralized treasury  risk management  tax  internal audit and consolidated financial reporting activities 
our sales are derived from commercial printing services 
these services consist of i traditional print services  including electronic prepress  printing  finishing  storage and delivery of high quality materials which are custom manufactured to our customers design specifications  ii fulfillment and mailing services for such printed materials  and iii digital technology solutions and e commerce capabilities that enable our customers to more efficiently procure and manage printed materials and or design  procure  distribute  track and analyze results of printing based marketing programs and activities 
examples of the types of documents we print for our customers include high quality  multi color marketing materials  product and capability brochures  point of purchase displays  direct mail pieces  shareholder communications  trading cards  catalogs and training manuals 
most of our sales are generated by individual orders through commissioned sales personnel 
we recognize revenue from these orders when we deliver the ordered goods and services 
to a large extent  continued engagement of our company by our customers for successive business opportunities depends upon the customers satisfaction with the quality of products and services we provide 
as such  it is difficult for us to predict with any high degree of certainty the number  size  and profitability of printing services that we expect to provide for more than a few weeks in advance 
our revenues  however  tend to be strongest in the quarter ended december followed by revenue in the quarter ended march conversely  revenues tend to be seasonally weaker in the quarters ended june and september 
table of contents our cost of sales mainly consists of raw materials consumed in the printing process  as well as labor and outside services  such as delivery costs 
paper cost is the most significant component of our materials cost  however  fluctuation in paper pricing generally does not materially impact our operating margins because we typically quote  and subsequently purchase  paper for each specific printing project we are awarded 
as a result  any changes in paper pricing are effectively passed through to customers by our printing businesses 
additionally  our cost of sales includes salary and benefits paid to operating personnel  maintenance  repair  rental and insurance costs associated with operating our facilities and equipment and depreciation charges 
our selling expenses generally include the compensation paid to our sales professionals  along with promotional  travel and entertainment costs 
our general and administrative expenses generally include the salary and benefits paid to support personnel at our printing businesses and our corporate staff including stock based compensation  as well as office rent  utilities and communications expenses  various professional services and amortization of identifiable intangible assets

we provided for income taxes for fiscal of million  reflecting an overall effective tax rate of as compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal in fiscal  an income tax benefit of million attributable to the goodwill impairment discussed above and a one time credit of 
million for the impact of a net reduction in legislated state income tax rates on previously provided deferred income taxes were recorded 
these tax benefits resulted in a net decrease of 
on our overall effective tax rate 
excluding these items  the decrease in our overall effective tax rate was primarily attributable to i an increase in pre tax earnings  which caused non deductible expenses to be a smaller percentage of pre tax earnings  thus lowering our effective tax rate and ii an increase in the estimated domestic production activities deduction for fiscal liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our historical sources of cash have primarily been cash provided by operations or borrowings under our various bank credit facilities
