item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading independent auto finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles 
we generate revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by us 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization and to fund the repurchase of receivables pursuant to clean up call options  we use available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we earn finance charge income on the finance receivables and pay interest expense on borrowings under our credit facilities 
we  through wholly owned subsidiaries  periodically transfer receivables to securitization trusts trusts that issue asset backed securities to investors 
we retain an interest in these securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization  whereby more receivables are transferred to the trusts than the amount of asset backed securities issued by the trusts  as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by us over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once predetermined credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to us or  in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure  may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities 
in addition to excess cash flows  we receive monthly base servicing fees and we collect other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for securitization trusts 
for securitization transactions that involve the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy  credit enhancement requirements will increase if targeted portfolio performance ratios are exceeded 
excess cash flows otherwise distributable to us from trusts in which the portfolio performance ratios were exceeded and from other trusts which may be subject to limited cross collateralization provisions are accumulated in the trusts until such higher levels of credit enhancement are reached and maintained 
senior subordinated securitizations typically do not utilize portfolio performance ratios 

table of contents we structure our securitization transactions as secured financings 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction and record a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 
prior to october   securitization transactions were structured as sales of finance receivables 
we also acquired two securitization trusts which were accounted for as sales of finance receivables 
receivables sold under this structure are referred to herein as gain on sale receivables 
at june   we had no outstanding gain on sale securitizations 
on may   we acquired the stock of bay view acceptance corporation bvac 
bvac served auto dealers in states offering specialized auto finance products  including extended term financing and higher loan to value advances to consumers with prime credit bureau scores 
on january   we acquired the stock of long beach acceptance corporation lbac 
lbac served auto dealers in states offering auto finance products primarily to consumers with near prime credit bureau scores 
as of june   the operations of bvac and lbac have been integrated into our origination  servicing and administrative activities and we provide auto finance products solely under the americredit financial services  inc name 
since january  we have revised our operating plan in an effort to preserve and strengthen our capital and liquidity position  and to maintain sufficient capacity on our credit facilities to fund new loan originations until capital market conditions improve for securitization transactions 
under this revised plan  we increased the minimum credit score requirements for new loan originations  decreased our originations infrastructure by closing and consolidating credit center locations  selectively decreased the number of dealers from whom we purchase loans and reduced originations and support function headcounts 
we have discontinued new originations in our direct lending  leasing and specialty prime platforms  certain partner relationships  and in canada 
our fiscal target for annualized loan origination levels has been reduced to approximately billion 
we recognized restructuring charges of million for fiscal  related to the closing and consolidating of credit center locations and headcount reductions 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
table of contents which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established systematically based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
we review charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the probable credit losses 
we also use historical charge off experience to determine a loss confirmation period  which is defined as the time between when an event  such as delinquency status  giving rise to a probable credit loss occurs with respect to a specific account and when such account is charged off 
this loss confirmation period is applied to the forecasted probable credit losses to determine the amount of losses inherent in finance receivables at the reporting date 
assumptions regarding credit losses and loss confirmation periods are reviewed periodically and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumption or loss confirmation period increase  there would be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which would decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the amount of provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations 
a and increase in cumulative net credit losses over the loss confirmation period would increase the allowance for loan losses as of june   as follows in thousands adverse change adverse change impact on allowance for loan losses we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in our receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income tax in the united states and canada 
in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions  calculations  structures and filing positions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
at any point in time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions and we record liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement management believes that the estimates are reasonable 
however  due to expiring statutes of limitations  audits  settlements  changes in tax law or new authoritative rulings  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be comparable to what was reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we may need to adjust our accrued tax assets or liabilities if actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust these assumptions in the future  which could materially impact the effective tax rate  earnings  accrued tax balances and cash 
as a part of our financial reporting process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated to be unrecoverable 
in this process  certain criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses  credit carrybacks  and estimated taxable income in future years 
based upon our earnings history and earnings projections  management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the asset will be fully realized 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been provided on deferred taxes 
our judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period in which such determinations are made 
since july   we have accounted for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fin fin requires that a more likely than not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  accrual of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition

the provision for loan losses recorded for fiscal and reflects inherent losses on receivables originated during those periods and changes in the amount of inherent losses on receivables originated in prior periods 
the provision for loan losses increased to  million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of weaker credit performance from the lbac portfolio and sub prime loans originated in calendar years and as well as higher expected future losses due to weaker economic conditions  particularly in certain geographic areas  including florida and southern california

delinquencies in our managed receivables portfolio may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio  seasonality within the calendar year and economic factors 
due to our target customer base  a relatively high percentage of accounts become delinquent at some point in the life of a loan and there is a high rate of account movement between current and delinquent status in the portfolio 
delinquencies in finance receivables were higher at june   as compared to june   as a result of deterioration in credit performance for the reasons described above 
deferrals in accordance with our policies and guidelines  we  at times  offer payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred  except where state law provides for a lesser amount 
our policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
additionally  we generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received 
due to the nature of our customer base and policies and guidelines of the deferral program  approximately of accounts historically comprising the managed portfolio received a deferral at some point in the life of the account 

table of contents an account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
thereafter  such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account 
contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average receivables outstanding were as follows years ended june  finance receivables as a percentage of average finance receivables total managed portfolio as a percentage of average managed receivables the following is a summary of total deferrals as a percentage of receivables outstanding june  finance receivables never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total june  finance receivables total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total we evaluate the results of our deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred 
table of contents versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time 
based on this evaluation  we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio 
changes in deferment levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of finance receivables charged off by us 
however  the timing of a charge off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge off 
to the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off  historical charge off ratios and loss confirmation periods used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses are also impacted 
increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period  which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses

b percentages exclude recoveries related to accounts with deficiency balances sold to third parties totaling approximately million for fiscal net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and economic factors 
the increase in net charge offs for fiscal  as an annualized percentage of average receivables  as compared to fiscal and  was a result of weaker credit performance from the lbac portfolio and sub prime loans originated in calendar years and  as well as a decline in the wholesale values for used cars

in connection with the issuance of these convertible senior notes  we used net proceeds of million to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased call options that entitle us to purchase shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the number of shares issued upon conversion of the notes at per share and per share for the notes due in and  respectively 
these call options are expected to allow us to offset the dilution of our shares if the conversion feature of the convertible senior notes is exercised 
we also sold warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share and  shares of our common stock at per share for the notes due in and  respectively 
in no event are we required to deliver a number of shares in connection with the exercise of these warrants in excess of twice the aggregate number of shares initially issuable upon the exercise of the warrants

the notes  which are uncollateralized  are convertible prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at per share 
additionally  we may exercise our option to repurchase the notes  or holders of the convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase the notes  on november   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed  or after november  at par 
subsequent to june   we repurchased million of these convertible notes at a small discount 
holders of the remaining balance of million of these convertible notes may require us to repurchase the notes on november   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed 
in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased a call option that entitles us to purchase shares of our stock in an amount equal to the number of shares convertible at per share 
this call option allows us to offset the dilution of our shares if the conversion feature of the convertible senior notes is exercised 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
each warrant entitles the holder  at its option  and subject to certain provisions within the warrant agreement  to purchase shares of common stock from us at per share  at any time prior to its expiration on october  during fiscal  we sold the call option and repurchased these warrants

the table above does not include these liabilities due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these amounts 

table of contents securitizations we have completed securitization transactions through june   excluding securitization trusts entered into by bvac and lbac prior to their acquisition by us 
the proceeds from the transactions were primarily used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities

table of contents we structure our securitization transactions as secured financings 
finance receivables are transferred to a securitization trust  which is one of our special purpose finance subsidiaries  and the trusts issue one or more series of asset backed securities securitization notes payable 
while these trusts are included in our consolidated financial statements  these trusts are separate legal entities  thus the finance receivables and other assets held by these trusts are legally owned by these trusts  are available to satisfy the related securitization notes payable and are not available to our creditors or our other subsidiaries 
at the time of securitization of finance receivables  we are required to pledge assets equal to a specified percentage of the securitization pool to provide credit enhancement required for specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
generally  we employ two types of securitization structures 
the structure we have utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by an insurer 
several of the financial guaranty insurers used by us in the past are facing financial stress and have been downgraded by the rating agencies due to risk exposures on insurance policies that guarantee mortgage debt and related structured products and one of the financial guaranty insurers we have utilized in the past  has decided to no longer issue insurance policies on asset backed securities 
as a result  demand for securities guaranteed by insurance  particularly securities backed by sub prime collateral  has weakened  and we do not anticipate utilizing this structure in the foreseeable future 
the second type of securitization structure we use and the structure we anticipate utilizing for the foreseeable future  involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
we currently expect our initial cash deposit and overcollateralization requirements for such transactions to be in the mid range increasing to a higher level of targeted credit enhancement 
this level of credit enhancement will require significantly greater use of our capital than in similar securitization transactions we have completed in the past 
increases or decreases to the credit enhancement level required in future securitization transactions will depend on the net interest margin of the finance receivables transferred  the collateral characteristics of the receivables transferred  credit performance trends of our finance receivables  our financial condition and the economic environment 
in april  we entered into a one year  billion forward purchase commitment agreement with deutsche bank ag  cayman islands branch deutsche 
under this agreement and subject to certain terms  deutsche will purchase triple a rated asset backed securities issued by our sub prime amcar securitization platform in registered public offerings  including the senior asset backed securities under the senior subordinated structure described above 

table of contents cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts gain on sale trusts secured financing trusts the agreements with the insurers of our securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default or cumulative net loss in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 
the securitization transactions insured by some of our financial guaranty insurance providers are cross collateralized to a limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original target credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
during fiscal and as of june   three lbac securitizations lb a  lb b and lb a had delinquency ratios in excess of the targeted levels 
as part of an arrangement with the insurer of these transactions  the excess cash flows from our other securitizations insured by this insurer were used to fund higher credit enhancement requirements in the lbac trusts which exceeded the portfolio performance ratios 
as of june   we have reached the higher required credit enhancement levels in these three lbac trusts 
during fiscal  we entered into an agreement with an insurer to increase the portfolio performance ratios in the m securitization 
in return for higher portfolio performance ratios  we agreed to use excess cash flow from other securitizations insured by this insurer to fund the higher credit enhancement requirement for the m trust 
as of june   we have reached the higher required credit enhancement in this trust 

table of contents the agreements that we enter into with our financial guaranty insurance providers in connection with securitization transactions contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default and cumulative net loss that are higher than the limits referred to above 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate our servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted so that a default under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance provider to terminate our servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
additionally  if these higher targeted portfolio performance levels were exceeded  the financial guaranty insurance providers may elect to retain all excess cash generated by other securitization transactions insured by them as additional credit enhancement 
this  in turn  could result in defaults under our other securitizations and other material indebtedness  including under our senior note and convertible senior note indentures 
although we have never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and do not anticipate violating any event of default triggers for our securitizations  there can be no assurance that our servicing rights with respect to the automobile receivables in such trusts or any other trusts will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii we breach our obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by us 
stock repurchases during fiscal  and  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share   shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  and  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  respectively 
we have repurchased  million of our common stock since april and we have remaining authorization to repurchase million of our common stock 
a covenant in our senior note indenture entered into in june limits our ability to repurchase stock 
currently  we are not eligible to repurchase shares under the indenture limits and do not anticipate pursuing repurchase activity for the foreseeable future 

table of contents recent market developments we anticipate that a number of factors will adversely impact our liquidity in fiscal higher credit enhancement levels in our securitization transactions caused by a reduction in excess spread due to higher cost of funds  and to a lesser extent  the credit deterioration we are experiencing in our portfolio  disruptions in the capital markets and making the execution of securitization transactions more challenging and expensive  and decreased cash distributions from our securitization trusts due to weaker credit performance 
since january  we have revised our operating plan in an effort to preserve and strengthen our capital and liquidity position  and to maintain sufficient capacity on our credit facilities to fund new loan originations until capital market conditions improve for securitization transactions 
under this revised plan  we increased the minimum credit score requirements for new loan originations  decreased our originations infrastructure by closing and consolidating credit center locations  selectively decreased the number of dealers from whom we purchase loans and reduced originations and support function headcounts 
we have discontinued new originations in our direct lending  leasing and specialty prime platforms  certain partner relationships  and in canada 
our fiscal target for annualized loan origination levels has been reduced to approximately billion 
we recognized restructuring charges of million for fiscal  related to the closing and consolidating of credit center locations and headcount reductions 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and warehouse capacity to operate under this plan through fiscal however  if the asset backed securities market or the credit markets  in general  continue to deteriorate  or if economic factors further deteriorate resulting in weaker credit performance  we may need to reduce our targeted origination volume below the billion level to sustain adequate liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact our credit facilities and securitization transactions 
our gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on our finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund our purchases of finance receivables 

table of contents credit facilities finance receivables purchased by us and pledged to secure borrowings under our credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility  our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under our credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of our interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by our special purpose finance subsidiary to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiary is included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold by us is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
in november  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on our medium term note facility caused by fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in our securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
we utilize several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts  pre funding of securitization transactions and the use of revolving structures 
in our securitization transactions  we transfer fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements 
table of contents in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by our securitization trusts to a fixed rate  thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by us over the life of a securitization 
interest rate swap agreements purchased by us do not impact the amount of cash flows to be received by holders of the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the interest rate swap agreements serve to offset the impact of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate asset backed securities on the cash flows to be received by us from the trusts 
we utilize such arrangements to modify our net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on our risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  we may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase a financial instrument to protect the net spread in connection with the issuance of floating rate securities even if we choose not to hedge our future cash flows 
although the interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the trusts  cash outflows from the trusts ultimately impact our retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by us 
therefore  when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions are included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by us are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements are reflected in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than needed to cover finance receivables initially sold or pledged to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional receivables are delivered to the trust in amounts up to the pre funded balance held in the escrow account 
the use of pre funded securitizations allows us to lock in borrowing costs with respect to the finance receivables subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  we incur an expense in pre funded securitizations during the period between the initial delivery of finance receivables and the subsequent delivery of finance receivables equal to the difference between the interest earned on the proceeds held in the escrow account and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 

table of contents additionally  in may  we issued a revolving securitization transaction that allowed us to replace receivables as they amortize down rather than paying down the outstanding debt balance for a period of one year subject to compliance with certain covenants 
the use of this type of transaction allowed us to lock in borrowing costs for the revolving period and allowed us to finance approximately more receivables than in our typical amortizing securitization structure at that borrowing cost 
it is unlikely that we will be able to utilize this revolving structure in the foreseeable future due to challenging capital market conditions  particularly for sub prime collateral 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on our seven most recent securitization transactions 
portions of these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets
