use of non gaap financial measures certain information discussed below is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
specifically  included in  and interest income was   and  respectively  of tax exempt interest income from certain investment securities and loans 
an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax exempt income has been added back to the interest income totals discussed in certain sections of this management s discussion and analysis  representing tax equivalent adjustments of  and in  and  respectively  which increased net interest income accordingly 
the analysis of net interest income tables included in this annual report on form k provide a reconciliation of tax equivalent financial information to the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
this adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution s net interest income to that of another institution  as each will have a different proportion of tax exempt interest from their earning asset portfolios 
moreover  net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions  net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
for purposes of this measure as well  other financial institutions generally use tax equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution 
the company follows these practices

outlook recent data suggest that the us economy may be falling into recession  driven by sharp downturns in the housing and credit markets 
company management expects economic activity to contract modestly throughout  followed by a gradual recovery in the course of the current fed funds futures contracts indicate that federal reserve officials are likely to respond by cutting the fed funds target rate to by the end of the second quarter of  representing an aggregate decline of basis points since they started cutting rates in late september given the bank s liability sensitive balance sheet  these actual and anticipated rate declines are expected to favorably impact net interest income and provide some flexibility with respect to growing the bank s loan and securities portfolios to generate future earnings 
the bank s credit quality has been strong over the past several years and this continued to be the case at december  however  management is cognizant of softening economic conditions overall and declining real estate and loan collateral values in particular 
accordingly  management believes the continuation of strong credit quality will be a significant determinant of the company s future financial performance 
other factors  which could affect the company s financial performance and that of its common stock  are more fully enumerated in the forward looking statements discussion at the beginning of this annual report on form k and the company s discussion of certain risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this report 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully enumerated in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the reader of the financial statements should review these policies to gain a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses management believes the allowance for loan losses allowance is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance  which is established through a provision for loan loss expense  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of collateral 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
a smaller provision for loan losses results in higher net income  and when a greater amount of provision for loan losses is necessary  the result is lower net income 
refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses and provision  in this annual report on form k  for further discussion and analysis concerning the allowance 
income taxes the company estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from historical taxes paid and future taxable income and  to the extent that the recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets the valuation techniques used by the company to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based upon changes in economic conditions and other factors 
any changes in the estimates used by the company to determine the carrying value of its goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  or which otherwise adversely affect their value or estimated lives  may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further details of the company s accounting policies and estimates covering goodwill and other intangible assets

loans and investment securities are the bank s primary earning assets with additional capacity invested in money market instruments 
average earning assets represented and of total average assets during and  respectively 
the company  through its management of liabilities  attempts to provide stable and flexible sources of funding within established liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines 
this is accomplished through retail deposit products offered within the markets served  as well as through the prudent use of borrowed and brokered funds 
the company s objectives in managing its balance sheet are to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates  and to enhance profitability through strategies that promise sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk 
the company is deliberate in its efforts to maintain adequate liquidity  under prevailing and forecasted economic conditions  and to maintain an efficient and appropriate mix of core deposits  brokered deposits  and borrowed funds

the increase in average earning assets was principally attributed to average securities growth of  or  followed by a  or increase in average loans 
the tax equivalent yield on total average earning assets amounted to in compared with in  representing an increase of basis points 
the increase in earning asset yields was attributed  in part  to a basis point increase in the yield on securities  reflecting the restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio combined with higher available market yields throughout much of the yield on the loan portfolio increased basis points in  principally reflecting cash flows from the portfolio being reinvested into higher yielding new loan originations  particularly residential mortgage loans

partially offsetting these increases was an  or  decline in cash and cash equivalents 
securities the securities portfolio represented of the company s average earning assets during and generated of its total tax equivalent interest and dividend income  compared with in bank management considers securities as a relatively attractive means to effectively leverage the bank s strong capital position  as securities are typically assigned a significantly lower risk weighting for the purpose of calculating the bank s and the company s risk based capital ratios 
the securities portfolio is primarily comprised of mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies  us government sponsored enterprises  and other corporate issuers 
the portfolio also includes tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions  and obligations of other us government sponsored enterprises 
the overall objectives of the bank s strategy for the securities portfolio include maintaining appropriate liquidity reserves  diversifying earning assets  managing interest rate risk  leveraging the bank s strong capital position  and generating acceptable levels of net interest income 
the securities portfolio is managed under the policy guidelines established by the bank s board of directors 
total securities at december   total securities stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
securities portfolio restructuring in april  company s board of directors approved the restructuring of a portion of the company s balance sheet through the sale of  of its aggregate  available for sale securities portfolio  the proceeds from which were initially used to pay down short term borrowings 
since the company no longer had the intent to hold these securities until a recovery of their amortized cost  which may be at maturity  the company recorded an adjustment to write down these securities to fair value at march   resulting in an impairment loss of  the weighted average yield on the securities sold approximated  whereas the weighted average cost of the borrowings paid down approximated 
the company s overall objectives were to improve future period earnings  lower the interest rate risk profile of the company s balance sheet  and provide a means to more effectively respond to current and future yield curve environments 
during the latter part of the second quarter  market yields climbed to a five year high  with the benchmark year us treasury advancing to in mid june 
the strong increase in market yields presented opportunities for replacing the securities sold  increasing the bank s earning assets  and generating higher levels of net interest income 
trading securities trading securities are securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in price 
during the years ended december  and  the bank did not own any trading securities 
securities held to maturity securities held to maturity are debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity 
held to maturity investments are reported at their aggregate cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
during the years ended december  and  the bank did not own any securities held to maturity 
securities available for sale securities available for sale represented of total securities at december  and the designation of securities available for sale is made at the time of purchase  based upon management s intent to hold the securities for an indefinite time  however  these securities would be available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  related changes in the securities prepayment risk  needs for liquidity  or changes in the availability of and yield on alternative investments 
the securities available for sale portfolio is used for liquidity purposes while simultaneously producing earnings 
securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings but shown separately as a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are determined using the specific identification method and are shown separately in the consolidated statements of income 
the balances of securities available for sale are stated on the consolidated balance sheet net of fair value adjustments  reflecting net unrealized gains of  and net unrealized losses of  at december  and  respectively 
the change in net unrealized gains and losses was principally attributed to changes in the securities portfolio composition and prevailing end of year market interest rates 
the change in unrealized gains and losses also reflects the restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio 
the unrealized loss position at december  reflects prevailing market conditions at that time and the fact that a portion of the securities were purchased during periods of historically low interest rates and available market yields 
the following table summarizes the securities available for sale portfolio as of december  and december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses estimated fair value available for sale obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government sponsored enterprises us government agencies other mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions thereof total december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses estimated fair value available for sale obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government sponsored enterprises us government agencies other mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions thereof total purchase premiums and discounts securities are typically purchased at premium or discounted prices  depending on the coupon of the security and prevailing market yields 
the bank recognizes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts in interest income using the interest method over the estimated life of the security 
securities interest income the aggregate tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio amounted to in  compared with in  representing an improvement of basis points 
the increase was principally attributed to the restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio in  combined with the availability of higher market yields in compared with prior years 
additionally  most of the cash flows from the securities portfolio were reinvested into securities with higher yields 
the total tax equivalent interest income from the securities portfolio amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or

securities maturity distribution and weighted average yields the following tables summarize the maturity distribution of the amortized cost of the bank s securities portfolio and weighted average yields of such securities on a fully tax equivalent basis as of december  the maturity distribution is based upon the final maturity date of the securities 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or pre pay certain securities 
in the case of mortgage backed securities  actual maturities may also differ from expected maturities due to the amortizing nature of the underlying mortgage collateral  and the fact that borrowers have the right to prepay

s 
government agencies and sponsored enterprises  where the aggregate book value of the securities exceeded of the company s shareholders equity 
management believes us government sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk  as they play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
at december  and  all securities issued by government agencies and sponsored enterprises were credit rated aaa by moody s and standard and poor s 
securities credit risk the bank continuously evaluates and monitors the credit risk of its securities utilizing a variety of resources including external credit rating agencies  predominantly moody s and standard and poor s 
all of the bank s mortgage backed securities were rated aaa as of december  the bank held no investment securities having a credit rating below a as of december  as of december   the bank did not own any commercial mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations  or pools of subprime mortgage backed securities 
impaired securities the securities portfolio contains certain securities where amortized cost exceeds fair market value  which at december  amounted to an excess of  compared with  at december  unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded as a loss on the company s consolidated statements of income 
in evaluating whether impairment is other than temporary  management considers a variety of factors including the nature of the investment security  the cause of the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  and the bank s ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
other data considered by management includes  for example  sector credit ratings  volatility of the security s market price  and any other information and observable data considered relevant in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred 
at december  and  management determined there were no unrealized losses in the securities portfolio that were other than temporary 
the following table summarizes temporarily impaired securities and their approximate fair values at december  all securities referenced are debt securities 
at december   the bank did not hold any common stock or equity securities in its securities portfolio 
temporarily impaired securities december  less than months months or longer total description of securities fair value number of investments unrealized losses fair value number of investments unrealized losses fair value number of investments unrealized losses obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government sponsored enterprises us government agencies other mortgage backed securities obligations of states of the us and political subdivisions thereof total temporarily impaired securities at december   the total unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities amounted to  representing of their amortized cost 
as of december   unrealized losses on securities in a continuous unrealized loss position more than twelve months amounted to  or of their amortized cost 
for securities with unrealized losses  the following information was considered in determining that the impairments were not other than temporary securities backed by us government sponsored enterprises  all of which were credit rated aaa  have minimal credit risk  as these enterprises play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies all of which were credit rated aaa  are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and therefore bear no credit risk 
other mortgage backed securities  all of which were corporate mortgage backed securities  were all credit rated aaa 
these securities were additionally evaluated for credit risk based on the strength and performance of the underlying borrowers and collateral  and the extent of the current underlying credit support within the structure of each security 
obligations of states of the us and political subdivisions thereof  none of which were credit rated below a  were additionally evaluated for credit risk based on the underlying credit ratings and strength of the issuers and bond insurers  as well as the defined sources of repayment eg local property taxes  tax revenue  etc 
the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio at december  and were attributed to market interest rate increases  reflecting the volatile movements in the us treasury yield curve over the past several years 
specifically  certain debt securities were purchased when market interest rates were lower than the rates prevailing at december  and because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality or other factors  and because the bank has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery of their amortized cost  which may be at maturity  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  and management believes the extent of unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities will steadily diminish over time as principal payments and pre payments are received and durations continue to shorten 
in the case of debt securities  management believes unrealized losses will diminish over time as the periods remaining to maturity continue to shorten 
management also believes that any declines in the us treasury yield curve will further diminish the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio  as market values typically increase in a declining interest rate environment 
conversely  management believes that upward movements in the us treasury yield curve will increase the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio over the near term 
loans total loans at december   total loans amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
commercial loans accounted for  or of the loan growth  offset in part by small declines in consumer loans and tax exempt loans to municipalities and not for profit organizations 
in general  loan origination activity benefited from a still favorable market interest rate environment  a relatively stable local economy  and initiatives designed to expand the bank s product offerings and attract new customers while continuing to leverage its existing customer base 
the loan portfolio is primarily secured by real estate in the counties of hancock  washington and knox  maine 
the following table summarizes the major components of the bank s loan portfolio  net of deferred loan origination fees and costs  as of december over the past five years

factors contributing to the changes in the loan portfolio are enumerated in the following discussion and analysis 
commercial loans at december   total commercial loans stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
commercial loan growth was principally driven by commercial real estate mortgage loans  which posted an increase of  or 
at december  commercial real estate mortgage loan totaled  and represented of the loan portfolio  compared with at december  at december   commercial and industrial loans totaled  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
this category of loans represented of the loan portfolio at december  the bank s market area demographics have historically limited the growth potential in this particular category of loans 
loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers totaled  as of december   compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
this category of loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  the decline was principally attributed to pay downs on loan balances during the communities served by the bank generally offer limited opportunities for lending in this industry sector 
bank management attributes the overall growth in the commercial loan portfolio  in part  to an effective business banking team  a variety of new business development initiatives  focused incentive compensation plans and a relatively stable local economy 
consumer loans at december   total consumer loans  which principally consisted of residential real estate mortgage loans  stood at  compared with  at december   representing a decline  or residential real estate mortgage loans totaled at  as of december   compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
this category of loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  principally reflecting a softening real estate market  residential real estate mortgage loan originations started slowing in the latter part of and this trend continued throughout in  the bank originated and closed  in residential real estate mortgage loans  compared with  in  representing a decline of  or 
the new loan originations in replaced a significant amount of principal cash flows from the existing residential real estate loan portfolio which  given the interest rate environment compared with prior years  increased the overall yield on this portfolio and generated an increase in interest income of  or  compared with home equity loans totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the relatively small increase in home equity loans was in part attributed to mortgage refinancing activity  which was driven by the higher cost of prime interest rate based home equity loans  prompting borrowers to consolidate their debt into lower cost fixed rate mortgages 
loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures consumer loans  which also include credit card loans and student loans  totaled  at december  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
the overall decline in this category of loans was principally attributed to the sale of the bank s  student loan portfolio in given strong competition from the financing affiliates of consumer durable goods manufacturers  among other considerations  the bank has not campaigned aggressively for consumer installment loans over the past several years 
however  the bank continues to be one of relatively few community banks with its own credit card loan portfolio  as large credit card processing companies continue to acquire credit card portfolios and associated sources of non interest income from smaller financial institutions 
tax exempt loans tax exempt loans totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
tax exempt loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  tax exempt loans principally include loans to local government municipalities and  to a lesser extent  not for profit organizations 
government municipality loans typically have short maturities eg  tax anticipation notes 
government municipality loans are normally originated through a bid process among local financial institutions and are typically priced aggressively  thus generating narrow net interest margins 
real estate loans under foreclosure at december   real estate loans under foreclosure totaled  compared with at december   representing an increase of at december   real estate loans under foreclosure were represented by five consumer mortgage loans totaling and one commercial real estate loan totaling  at december   real estate loans under foreclosure were represented by four consumer mortgage loans amounting to and one commercial real estate loans totaling during  foreclosure proceedings were completed or otherwise resolved on all five of these loans  and any resulting charge offs were recognized 
loan concentrations because of the company s proximity to acadia national park  a large part of the economic activity in the area is generated from the hospitality business associated with tourism 
at december   approximately  or of the loan portfolio was represented by loans to the lodging industry  compared with  or at december  loan concentrations continued to principally reflect the bank s business region 
loans secured by real estate at december   consumer and commercial loans secured by real estate comprised of the loan portfolio  compared with at december  over the past few years the strength in the local real estate markets  both residential and commercial  has led to historically high property values in the bank s market area 
however  during the latter part of this trend began to soften and during property values began to decline 
recognizing the impact declining real estate values may have on the loan portfolio and origination pipeline  the bank periodically reviews its underwriting standards in an effort to ensure that the quality of the loan portfolio is not jeopardized by unrealistic loan to value ratios or debt service levels 
there was no significant deterioration in the performance or risk characteristics of the real estate loan portfolio through the reporting period 
other real estate owned real estate acquired in satisfaction of a loan is reported in other assets 
properties acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are transferred to other real estate owned oreo and recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value less estimated costs to sell based on appraised value at the date actually or constructively received 
loan losses arising from the acquisition of such property are charged against the allowance for loan losses

at december  total oreo amounted to  compared with none as of december  one commercial property comprised the december  balance of oreo 
mortgage loan servicing the bank from time to time will sell mortgage loans to other institutions  and investors 
the sale of loans allows the bank to make more funds available to customers in its servicing area  while the retention of servicing rights provides an additional source of income 
at december   the unpaid balance of mortgage loans serviced for others totaled  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
the decline in balances was attributed to serviced mortgage loan principal payments  as well as prepayments resulting from loan refinancing activity 
pursuant to the bank s asset and liability management strategy  its need for interest earning assets and its strong capital position  loans originated during and were held in the bank s loan portfolio 
loan portfolio interest rate composition the following table summarizes the commercial  tax exempt and consumer components of the loan portfolio by fixed and variable interest rate composition  as of december  and commercial fixed variable total tax exempt fixed variable total consumer fixed variable total total loans fixed variable total loans at december  fixed and variable rate loans comprised and of the loan portfolio compared with and at december   respectively 
loan maturities and re pricing distribution the following table summarizes fixed rate loans reported by remaining maturity  and floating rate loans by next re pricing date  as of december  and actual maturity dates may differ from contractual maturity dates due to prepayments or loan re financings 
maturities one year or less over years over years total loans credit risk credit risk is managed through loan officer authorities  loan policies  and oversight from the bank s senior credit officer  the bank s senior loan officers committee  the directors loan committee  and the bank s board of directors 
management follows a policy of continually identifying  analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing independent review  subsequent to management s review  of individual credits is performed by an independent loan review function  which reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
management recognizes that early and accurate recognition of risk is the best means to reduce credit losses and maximize earnings 
the bank employs a comprehensive risk management structure to identify and manage the risk of loss 
for consumer loans  the bank identifies loan delinquency beginning at day delinquency and provides appropriate follow up by written correspondence or personal contact 
non residential mortgage loan losses are recognized no later than the point at which a loan is days past due 
residential mortgage loan losses are recognized during the foreclosure process  or sooner  when that loss is quantifiable and reasonably assured 
for commercial loans the bank applies a risk grading system  which stratifies the portfolio and allows management to focus appropriate efforts on the highest risk components of the portfolio 
the risk grades include ratings that correlate with regulatory definitions of pass  other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are placed on non accrual status  either due to the delinquent status of principal and or interest  or a judgment by management that  although payments of principal and or interest are current  such action is prudent because collection in full of all outstanding principal and interest is in doubt 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal and or interest is days overdue  or sooner if judged appropriate by management 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and or interest payments are days overdue  or sooner if judged appropriate by management 
non performing loans non performing loans include loans on non accrual status  loans that have been treated as troubled debt restructurings  and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest 
there were no troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio during the last five years 
the following table sets forth the details of non performing loans over the last five years 
total non performing loans at december loans accounted for on a non accrual basis construction and development residential mortgage commercial and industrial  and agricultural consumer total non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days or more total non performing loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans non performing loans to total loans allowance to total loans during the year ended december   non performing loans increased  but remained at relatively low levels 
the bank attributes this to mature credit administration processes and underwriting standards  aided by a relatively stable local economy 
the bank maintains a centralized loan collection and managed asset department  providing timely and effective collection efforts for problem loans 
at december   total non performing loans amounted to  or of total loans  compared with or of total loans as of december  the increase in non performing loans was attributed to the migration of one commercial real estate mortgage loan of  or  of total non performing loans at december  while the level of non performing loan ratios continued to reflect the favorable quality of the loan portfolio at december   bank management is cognizant of the slowing real estate market and softening economic conditions overall  and believes it is managing credit risk accordingly 
future levels of non performing loans may be influenced by economic conditions  including the impact of those conditions on the bank s customers  including interest rates and debt service levels  oil and gas prices  and other factors existing at the time 
management believes the economic activity and conditions in the local real estate markets will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the loan portfolio in future periods and  thus  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
potential problem loans in addition to the non performing loans discussed above  the bank also has loans that are to days delinquent 
these loans amounted to  and  at december  and  or and of total loans  respectively 
these loans and delinquency trends in general are considered in the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses and the related determination of the provision for loan losses 
subprime mortgage lending subprime mortgage lending  which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market  is not a market that bank management has ever actively pursued 
in general  the industry does not apply a uniform definition of what actually constitutes subprime lending 
in referencing subprime lending activities  bank management relies upon the statement of subprime mortgage lending issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies the agencies on june   which further references the expanded guidance for subprime lending programs the expanded guidance  issued by the agencies by press release dated january  in the expanded guidance  the agencies indicated that subprime lending does not refer to individual subprime loans originated and managed  in the ordinary course of business  as exceptions to prime risk selection standards 
the agencies recognize that many prime loan portfolios will contain such accounts 
the agencies also excluded prime loans that develop credit problems after origination and community development loans from the subprime arena 
according to the expanded guidance  subprime loans are other loans to borrowers that display one or more characteristics of reduced payment capacity 
five specific criteria  which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers and may not match all markets or institutions specific subprime definitions  are set forth  including having a fico credit score of or lower 
based on the definitions and exclusions described above  bank management considers the bank as a prime lender 
within the bank s residential mortgage loan portfolio there are loans that  at the time of origination  had fico scores of or below 
however  as a portfolio lender  the bank reviews all credit underwriting data including all data included in borrower credit reports and does not base its underwriting decisions solely on fico scores 
bank management believes the aforementioned loans  when made  were amply collateralized and documented  and otherwise conformed to the bank s prime lending standards 
allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses the allowance stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the increase in the allowance principally reflects the growth of the loan portfolio in the allowance is available to absorb losses on loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance and provisioning for estimated losses is evaluated quarterly based on review of loans  with particular emphasis on non performing and other loans that management believes warrant special consideration 
the allowance is maintained at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of risk inherent in the current loan portfolio  and adequate to provide for estimated losses 
reserves are established for specific loans including impaired loans  a pool of reserves based on historical charge offs by loan types  and supplemental reserves that adjust historical loss experience to reflect current economic conditions  industry specific risks  and other observable data 
loan loss provisions are recorded based upon overall aggregate data  and the allowance is increased when  on an aggregate basis  additional estimated losses are identified and deemed by management as being likely 
no portion of the allowance is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future allowance allocations could vary from current estimates 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance  which also may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance  based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table details changes in the allowance for loan losses and summarizes loan loss experience by loan type over the past five years

at december  and  all impaired loans had specific allowances 
the bank had no troubled debt restructurings at december  and  and all of its impaired loans were considered collateral dependent 
management reviews impaired loans to ensure such loans are transferred to interest non accrual status  and written down when necessary 
the amount of interest income not recorded on impaired loans amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general allowances for loan losses account for the risk and estimated loss inherent in certain pools of industry and geographic loan concentrations within the loan portfolio 
there were no major changes in loan concentrations during based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  management believes the allowance for loan losses at december  to be appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and resident in the local and regional economy as of that date 
funding sources the bank utilizes various traditional sources of funding to support its earning asset portfolios 
funding sources principally consist of retail deposits and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb of which it is a member  and certificates of deposit obtained from the national market 
historically  the banking business in the bank s market area has been seasonal  with lower deposits in the winter and spring and higher deposits in the summer and autumn 
these seasonal swings have been fairly predictable and have not had a materially adverse impact on the bank 
seasonal swings in deposits have been typically absorbed by the bank s strong liquidity position  including borrowing lines from the fhlb and cash flows from the securities portfolio 
according to a january report prepared by the maine bureau of financial institutions  during the first half of  maine banks experienced strong growth in core deposits  positively impacting liquidity for maine banks and lessening their reliance on non core funding 
as a consequence  among maine banks  the loan to core deposit ratio declined to at june   down from one year earlier  but still well above the national average of  which was up from one year earlier 
at december   the bank s loan to core deposit ratio amounted to  compared with at december  according to the maine bureau of financial institutions  maine banks rely on borrowings and other types of non core funding to a much greater degree than the national average  as maine banks historical core deposit growth has not kept pace with asset growth 
at june   borrowings and other types of non core funding supported of maine bank assets  down from one year earlier  but still well above the national average of  which was down from one year earlier 
at december  the bank s non core funding represented of total assets  compared with at december  while the foregoing ratios compare unfavorably to both maine banks and the national average of all federally insured banks  the bank has had a long and successful track record in managing its liquidity and funding its earning asset portfolios 
nevertheless  management believes that the bank s future success in growing core deposits will be a determinant factor in its ability to meaningfully grow earning assets and leverage its strong capital position 
deposits during  the most significant source of funding for the bank s earning assets continued to be retail deposits  gathered throughout its network of twelve banking offices throughout downeast and midcoast maine 
total average retail deposits accounted for of the funding required in supporting the bank s earning asset portfolios during  compared with in total deposits at december  total deposits amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the bank s deposit growth included  in certificates of deposit obtained from the national market brokered deposits  as the bank s earning asset growth outpaced retail deposit growth  thus and necessitating the use of an additional funding source 
total retail deposits at december   total retail deposits amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
demand deposits led the overall growth in deposits  posting an increase of  or compared with december  now accounts and retail certificates of deposits also contributed to retail deposit growth  posting increases of  and  or and  compared with december   respectively 
total average deposits total average deposits amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
total average retail deposits amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing a decline of  or 
the decline in average retail deposits was principally attributed to a  decline in money market accounts offered to clients of trust services  reflecting a reallocation of cash within certain managed asset portfolios in the course of normal operations 
excluding the deposit accounts offered to clients of trust services  total average retail deposits increased by  or  compared with in general  without considering the declines in money market accounts offered to clients of trust services  the bank s overall retail deposit growth in moderately lagged historical norms 
management believes that competition from banks and non banks intensified during  as savers and investors sought higher returns  and that financial institutions in particular have been aggressively pricing their deposits in order to fund earning asset growth 
management also believes that during investors may have reallocated a portion of their cash positions  believing the equity markets became more attractive from a total return perspective 
bank management believes it has exercised restraint with respect to overly aggressive deposit pricing strategies  and has sought to achieve an appropriate balance between retail deposit growth and wholesale funding levels  while protecting the bank s net interest margin and liquidity position 
the following table summarizes the changes in the average balances of deposits during the periods indicated  including the weighted average interest rates paid for each category of deposits average deposit balances by category of deposit average balance average rate average balance average rate demand deposits now accounts savings and money market deposits time deposits brokered time deposits total deposits demand deposits total demand deposits  which are principally business in nature  averaged  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
demand deposits represented of total average retail deposits in  compared with in consistent with the bank s market area demographics  a significant portion of its demand deposits are highly seasonal in nature  with balances peaking in the summer and autumn while declining in winter and spring 
while the exact timing of these seasonal swings may vary from year to year  based on historical trends  bank management anticipates that this category of deposits will show meaningful declines during the first quarter of  but will begin their seasonal upward trend in the latter part of the second quarter of the rate of average demand deposit growth moderately lagged historical norms during management believes that competition for demand deposits has intensified  with more financial institutions offering no fee checking accounts  aggressive relationship pricing  and other highly competitive promotional offerings 
the bank strives to attract demand deposits in connection with its commercial lending activities  on a total relationship basis 
the bank s business checking account offerings include small businessplus  businessplus  and free small business  each designed to help business owners manage the varying financial aspects of their business 
the bank also offers its business customers a variety of cash management products including a cash management sweep account 
customers are able to automatically transfer their excess demand deposit balances  over certain thresholds established with an earnings credit rate  to interest bearing  overnight securities repurchase agreements 
business demand deposits are also generated by way of the bank s merchant credit card processing program 
now account deposits the bank offers interest bearing now accounts to individuals  not for profit organizations and sole proprietor businesses 
total now accounts averaged  in  compared with  in  representing a decline of or 
in  total average now represented of total average retail deposits  compared with in bank management principally attributed the decline in now account deposit balances to the interest rate environment and an atmosphere of well publicized and more attractive short term interest rates provided by alternative deposit products  such as the bank s high yielding money market account 
during  the bank s most successful now account product continued to be gold wave checking  a relationship product designed for its age and above customers 
savings and money market deposits total savings and money market accounts averaged  in  compared with  in  representing a decline of  or 
savings and money market accounts represented of total average retail deposits during  compared with in the  decline in average savings and money market deposits in was attributed to the  decline in money market accounts offered to clients of trust services as discussed above 
excluding the money market accounts offered to clients of trust services  average savings and money market accounts increased by  or  compared with in response to competitive pricing pressures and market demand during a period of rising short term interest rates  in the bank introduced its new prime based horizon money market account  which management believes is highly competitive and designed to satisfy the needs of both small and large investors alike 
the growth in savings and money market accounts was principally attributed to this new product 
the bank also offers statement savings accounts and  as a community oriented financial institution  continues to support the more traditional passbook savings accounts 
time deposits total time deposits averaged  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
time deposits represented of total average retail deposits during  compared with in the growth in time deposits lagged historical norms 
given the strength of short term interest rates during  management believes investors and savers were attracted to relatively high yielding and liquid money market accounts 
additionally  in pricing time deposits  particularly non relationship time deposits  bank management will consider other sources of funding which may be offered at more attractive terms and prices  including borrowed funds and time deposits available in the national market brokered time deposits time deposits in denominations of or greater totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of or greater maturity schedule time deposits thousand or greater december  maturity three months or less over three to six months over six to twelve months over twelve months total brokered time deposits total brokered time deposits averaged  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
brokered time deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in the increase in brokered time deposits was primarily attributed to the funding needs associated with the bank s earning asset growth  principally loans  which outpaced retail deposit growth during the rates of interest paid on brokered time deposits were generally comparable with collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank  the primary source of wholesale funding used by the bank 
borrowed funds borrowed funds principally consist of advances from the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlb and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
advances from the fhlb are principally secured by stock in the fhlb  investment securities  and blanket liens on qualifying mortgage loans and home equity loans 
the bank utilizes borrowed funds in leveraging its strong capital position and supporting its earning asset portfolios 
borrowed funds are principally utilized to support the bank s securities portfolio and  to a lesser extent  fund loan growth 
borrowed funds also provide a means to help manage balance sheet interest rate risk  given the bank s ability to select desired amounts  terms and maturities on a daily basis 
total borrowings at december   total borrowings amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
total borrowings averaged  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
borrowings from the federal home loan bank at december   borrowings from the fhlb totaled  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
during  borrowings from the fhlb averaged  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in borrowings from the fhlb was utilized to fund earning asset growth  principally investment securities 
total average borrowings from the fhlb expressed as a percentage of total average assets amounted to during  compared with in securities sold under agreements to repurchase at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
during  securities sold under agreement to repurchase averaged  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase were collateralized by us government sponsored agency obligations  held in safekeeping by nonaffiliated financial institutions 
borrowing maturities borrowing maturities are managed in concert with the bank s asset and liability management strategy and are closely aligned with the ongoing management of balance sheet interest rate risk 
as of december   total short term borrowings  comprised of certain fhlb advances and all securities sold under repurchase agreements  amounted to  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
conversely  long term borrowings fhlb advances with a remaining term greater than one year at december  totaled  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
given the uncertainty about the future direction of interest rates throughout most of  and in light of its liability sensitive balance sheet  the bank modified the maturity mix of borrowing maturities to moderately reduce its exposure to rising interest rates over the longer term horizon 
this was accomplished by extending the maturities on a portion of new borrowings as well as the replacement certain short term borrowings that matured during capital resources consistent with its long term goal of operating a sound and profitable organization  during the company maintained its strong capital position and continued to be a well capitalized financial institution according to applicable regulatory standards 
management believes this to be vital in promoting depositor and investor confidence and providing a solid foundation for future growth 
historically  most of the company s capital requirements have been provided through retained earnings and this continued to be the case during the year ended december  stock repurchase plan in february  the company s board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  or approximately  shares 
purchases began on march  and were continued through december in december of the company s board of directors authorized the continuance of this program through december  depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice and may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of stock under this plan  at a total cost of  and an average price of per share 
the company recorded the repurchased shares as treasury stock 
the company believes that a stock repurchase plan is a prudent use of its capital at this time 
management anticipates the stock repurchase plan will be accretive to the return on average shareholders equity and earnings per share 
management also believes that the stock repurchase plan helps facilitate an orderly market for the disposition of large blocks of stock  and lessens the price volatility associated with the company s thinly traded stock 
cash dividends the company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
each quarter the board of directors declares the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends  subject to adjustment from time to time  based on the company s earnings outlook  the strength of the balance sheet  its need for funds  and other relevant factors 
there can be no assurance that dividends on the company s common stock will be paid in the future 
the company s principal source of funds to pay cash dividends and support its commitments is derived from bank operations 
during  the company declared and distributed cash dividends in the aggregate amount of  compared with  in the company s dividend payout ratio amounted to  compared with in the total dividends paid in amounted to per common share of stock  compared with in  representing an increase of  or 
in the first quarter of  the company increased its quarterly cash dividend by to per common share  representing an increase of or compared with the dividend paid for the same quarter in the dividend will be paid march  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  capital ratios the company and the bank are subject to the risk based capital guidelines administered by the company s and the bank s principal regulators 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under these guidelines  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of  including a minimum ratio of tier i capital to total risk weighted assets of and a tier i capital to average assets of leverage ratio 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
as of december  and  the company and the bank were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a minimum total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  a minimum tier i capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  and a minimum tier i leverage ratio of at least 
at december   the company s total risk based capital was  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  at december   the company s tier i capital totaled  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  the ratio of tier i capital to average assets  or leverage ratio  at december  was  compared with at december  the following table sets forth the company s regulatory capital at december  and  under the rules applicable at that date

at december   the bank s tier i leverage  tier i risk based and total risk based capital ratios stood at  and  respectively 
there are no known trends  events or uncertainties  nor any recommendations by any regulatory authority  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s capital resources  liquidity  or financial condition 
contractual obligations the company is a party to certain contractual obligations under which it is obligated to make future payments 
these principally include borrowings from the fhlb  consisting of short and long term fixed rate borrowings  and collateralized by all stock in the fhlb  a blanket lien on qualified collateral consisting primarily of loans with first and second mortgages secured by one to four family properties  and certain pledged investment securities 
the company has an obligation to repay all borrowings from the fhlb 
the company is also obligated to make payments on operating leases for its branch office in somesville and its office in bangor  maine 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  borrowings are stated at their contractual maturity due dates and do not reflect call features  or principal amortization features  on certain borrowings 
contractual obligations payments due by period description total amount of obligations year years years years operating leases borrowings from federal home loan bank securities sold under agreements to repurchase total all fhlb advances are fixed rate instruments 
advances are payable at their call dates or final maturity dates 
at december   the bank had  in callable advances 
in the normal course of its banking and financial services business  and in connection with providing products and services to its customers  the company has entered into a variety of traditional third party contracts for support services 
examples of such contractual agreements would include services providing atm  visa debit and credit card processing  trust services accounting support  check printing  and the leasing of t telecommunication lines supporting the company s wide area technology network 
the majority of the company s core operating systems and software applications are maintained in house with traditional third party maintenance agreements of one year or less 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is  from time to time  a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  that may be material to investors 
at december  and  the company s off balance sheet arrangements were limited to standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit the bank guarantees the obligations or performance of certain customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third parties 
these letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third party debt 
the risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit products 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon issuance of a standby letter of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the customer 
at december   commitments under existing standby letters of credit totaled  compared with at december  the fair value of the standby letters of credit was not significant as of the foregoing dates 
off balance sheet risk the bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain financial derivative instruments  namely  interest rate swap agreements and interest rate floor agreements 
commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit represent agreements by the bank to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis using the same credit policies as it does for its balance sheet instruments  such as loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon the issuance of commitment  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
the following table summarizes the bank s commitments to extend credit as of december commitments to extend credit december  december  commitments to originate loans unused lines of credit un advanced portions of construction loans total financial derivative instruments as part of its overall asset and liability management strategy  the bank periodically uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on net interest income 
derivative instruments that management periodically uses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swap agreements and interest rate floor agreements 
a policy statement  approved by the board of directors of the bank  governs use of derivative instruments 
at december   the bank had three outstanding derivative instruments with notional amounts totaling  the notional amounts of the financial derivative instruments do not represent exposure to credit loss 
the bank is exposed to credit loss only to the extent the counter party defaults in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the agreements 
management does not anticipate non performance by the counter parties to the agreements  and regularly reviews the credit quality of the counter parties from which the instruments have been purchased 
the details of the bank s financial derivative instruments as of december  are summarized as follows 
the reader should also refer to note of the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item in this report on form k

the bank is required to pay a counter party monthly variable rate payments indexed to prime  while receiving fixed rate payments based upon an interest rate of over the term of the agreement 
the following table summarizes the contractual cash flows of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december   based upon the then current prime interest rate of payments due by period total less than year years fixed payments due from counter party variable payments due to counter party based on prime rate net cash flow total net cash flows paid to counter parties amounted to and in and  respectively

under the terms of the agreements  the bank paid premiums of and for the right to receive cash flow payments if the prime interest rate falls below the predetermined floor rates of and  thus effectively ensuring interest income on the pools of prime based loans at minimum rates of and on the  and  notional amounts for the duration of the agreements  respectively 
the interest rate floor agreements were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas liquidity liquidity is measured by the company s ability to meet short term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss 
the company seeks to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands 
besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations  liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs 
many factors affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served by its network of offices  its mix of assets and liabilities  reputation and credit standing in the marketplace  and general economic conditions 
the bank actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios established under its asset liability management policy approved by the bank s board of directors 
continual monitoring of these ratios  both historical and through forecasts under multiple rate scenarios  allows the bank to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank uses a basic surplus model to measure its liquidity over and day time horizons 
the relationship between liquid assets and short term liabilities that are vulnerable to non replacement are routinely monitored 
the bank s policy is to maintain its liquidity position at approximately of total assets 
at december   liquidity  as measured by the basic surplus model  was over the day horizon and over the day horizon 
a portion of the bank s deposit base has been historically seasonal in nature  with balances typically declining in the winter months through late spring  during which period the bank s liquidity position tightens 
at december   the bank had unused lines of credit and net unencumbered qualifying collateral availability to support its credit line with the fhlb approximating million 
the bank also had capacity to borrow funds on a secured basis utilizing certain un pledged securities in its securities portfolio 
the bank s loan portfolio provides an additional source of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through pledging or sales 
however  there were no loans held for sale at december  the bank also has access to the national brokered deposit market  and has been using this funding source to bolster its liquidity position 
the bank maintains a liquidity contingency plan approved by the bank s board of directors 
this plan addresses the steps that would be taken in the event of a liquidity crisis  and identifies other sources of liquidity available to the company 
company management believes that the level of liquidity is sufficient to meet current and future funding requirements 
however  changes in economic conditions  including consumer savings habits and availability or access to the brokered deposit market could potentially have a significant impact on the company s liquidity position 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and virtually all of the liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates and the us treasury yield curve may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
while the financial nature of the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  inflation does affect the company because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total company assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation

for the year ended december   fully diluted earnings per share amounted to  compared with and in and  representing increases of and  or and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income is the principal component of the company s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is entirely generated by the bank 
fluctuations in market interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
total net interest income for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of  or and a decline of or  respectively 
the increase in fully tax equivalent net interest income was principally attributed to average earning asset growth of  or  as the fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined seven basis points to  compared with the decline in fully tax equivalent net interest income was principally attributed to a basis point decline in the fully tax equivalent net interest margin  which in amounted to compared with in this decline was largely offset by earning asset growth of  or 
as was widely the situation throughout the banking industry  the decline in the net interest margin was largely attributed to the seventeen consecutive increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve bank from june to june and a flat to inverted yield curve throughout  the impact of which caused the bank s funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield on its earning asset portfolios 
factors contributing to the changes in net interest income and the net interest margin are further enumerated in the following discussion and analysis

net interest margin the net interest margin  expressed on a tax equivalent basis  represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and interest paid to depositors and other creditors  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
the net interest margin is determined by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the average tax equivalent yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is generally higher than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity 
the company s net interest margin amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing year over year declines of and basis points  respectively

in june of  following an extended period of historically low interest rates  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve began increasing short term interest rates 
through june of  the fed funds targeted rate had been increased seventeen times for a total of basis points  ending at 
however  during this same period of time  the benchmark year us treasury note increased only basis points  causing a dramatic basis point flattening of the us treasury yield curve the yield curve 
the yield curve remained flat to inverted throughout in  the bank s net interest margin began to decline and this decline steadily continued through the first quarter of the declining net interest margin was principally attributed to the increases in the bank s cost of funds outpacing the increases in yields on its interest earning assets  reflecting the re pricing of a large portion of the bank s funding base during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  combined with highly competitive pricing pressures with respect to loans and deposits  and the inherent net interest margin challenges widely associated with a flat or inverted us treasury yield curve 
in the second quarter of  the bank s year over year net interest margin stabilized  as the increase in the bank s weighted average cost of funds was less than the increase in the weighted average yield on its earning asset portfolios 
also in the second quarter of  the yield curve began to steepen  as long term interest rates advanced to five year highs  favorably impacting the bank s net interest margin 
during last four months of  the federal reserve lowered short term interest rates three times for a total of one hundred basis points 
these actions favorably impacted the bank s net interest margin  reflecting its liability sensitive balance sheet 
for the fourth quarter of the bank s net interest margin was showing an increase of basis points compared with the same quarter in and was up basis points on a linked quarter basis 
for the year ended december  the weighted average yield on average earning assets amounted to  compared with and in and  representing increases of and basis points  respectively 
the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing year over year increases of and basis points  respectively 
in short  during and  the increases in the weighted average cost of the bank s interest bearing liabilities exceeded the increases in weighted average yields on its earning assets portfolios by and basis points  respectively 
as noted above  the federal reserve s actions in reducing short term interest rates in late favorably impacted the bank s net interest margin 
in the fourth quarter of  the increase in the weighted average yield on earning assets exceeded the increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities by basis points  compared with the same quarter in fourth quarter tax equivalent net interest income was up  or  compared with the same quarter in company management anticipates that the federal reserve s actions in reducing short term interest rates including the additional basis point reduction in january  if sustained  will continue to have a positive impact on the bank s future net interest margin and future levels of net interest income  given its liability sensitive balance sheet 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity position is more fully described in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest income for the year ended december   total interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing year over year increases of  and  or and  respectively 
the  increase in interest income was attributed to average earning asset growth of  or  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average earning asset yield  compared with interest income from loans increased  or  attributed to average loan growth of  or  and an increase in the weighted average loan portfolio yield of basis points  compared with interest income from securities increased  or  which was attributed to average securities growth of  or  and an increase in the weighted average securities portfolio yield of basis points  compared with the increase in yield on the securities portfolio principally reflects the restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio in the second quarter of and the availability of higher market yields during certain periods in compared with prior years 
the  increase in interest income compared with was attributed to average earning asset growth of  or  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average earning asset yield 
the increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve in and favorably impacted the weighted average yields on the bank s variable rate loan portfolios in in addition  during cash flows from the bank s fixed rate loan and securities portfolios were generally reinvested into higher yielding earning assets 
as depicted on the rate volume analysis tables below  the increased volume of average earning assets on the balance sheet during contributed  to the increase in interest income compared with  while the increase attributed to the impact of a higher weighted average earning assets yield amounted to  in  the increased volume of average earning assets on the balance sheet contributed  to the increase in interest income compared with  while the increase attributed to the impact of a higher weighted average earning assets yield amounted to  interest expense for the year ended december   total interest expense amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing year over year increases of  and  or and  respectively 
the  increase in interest expense compared with was principally attributed to a  or increase in average interest bearing liabilities  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits outpaced the weighted average cost of borrowed funds by basis points  reflecting the re pricing of certain maturity time deposits  highly competitive market pricing pressures for deposits and a higher utilization of brokered time deposits 
given the highly competitive market pricing pressures and the need to strengthen customer relationships  in the bank more closely followed the market with respect to the upward pricing and re pricing of maturity and non maturity deposits 
the  increase in interest expense compared with was principally attributed to a  or increase in average interest bearing liabilities  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities was principally attributed to increases in short term market interest rates between periods and  to a lesser extent  a proportionately higher utilization of wholesale funding 
as depicted on the rate volume analysis tables below  the increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet during contributed  to the increase in interest expense compared with  while the increase attributed to the impact of a higher weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities contributed  in  the increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet contributed  to the increase in interest expense compared with  while the increase attributed to the impact of a higher weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities contributed  rate volume analysis the following tables set forth a summary analysis of the relative impact on net interest income of changes in the average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in average rates on such assets and liabilities 
the income from tax exempt assets has been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis  thereby allowing uniform comparisons to be made 
because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the periods analyzed  it is not possible to precisely allocate changes to volume or rate 
for presentation purposes  changes which are not solely due to volume changes or rate changes have been allocated to these categories in proportion to the relationships of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses reflects the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses the allowance at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of inherent risk of loss in the bank s current loan portfolio 
the bank s non performing loans remained at relatively low levels during  despite an increase from at december   total non performing loans amounted to  or of total loans  compared with or at december  the allowance expressed as a percentage of non performing loans amounted to at december   compared with at december  the bank s loan loss experience remained at low levels during for the year ended december  net loan charge offs amounted to  or net charge offs to average loans outstanding of  compared with or net charge offs to average loans outstanding of in for the year ended december   the bank recorded a provision for loan losses of  compared with in and no provision in the increase in the provision for loan losses compared with principally reflected the growth in the total loan portfolio and  to a lesser extent  the increase in non performing loans

non interest income in addition to net interest income  non interest income is a significant source of revenue for the company and an important factor in its results of operations 
for the year ended december   total non interest income amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decline of or and an increase of or  respectively 
the decline in non interest income compared with was principally attributed to a  decline in net securities gains  principally resulting from the bank s restructuring of a portion of its securities portfolio in excluding securities gains and losses  non interest income increased  or  compared with factors contributing to the changes in non interest income are enumerated in the following discussion and analysis trust and financial services income income from trust and financial services represented of the company s total non interest income in  compared with and in and  respectively 
income from trust and financial services is principally derived from fee income based on a percentage of the market value of client assets under management and held in custody and  to a lesser extent  revenue from brokerage services conducted through bar harbor financial services  an independent third party broker 
for the year ended december   income generated from trust and financial services amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing year over year increases of and  or and  respectively 
the increase in fee income from trust and financial services was principally attributed to the growth of the managed assets portfolio at trust services 
at december   total assets under management stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the increase in fee income from trust and financial services was driven by trust and investment services  as revenue generated from third party brokerage activities at bar harbor financial services posted moderate declines  reflecting lower trading volumes  including sales of mutual funds and annuity products 
during  the company placed less emphasis on third party brokerage activities and reduced the associated operating overhead 
at december   total assets under management at trust services stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or service charges on deposit accounts this income is principally derived from monthly deposit account maintenance and activity fees  overdraft fees  automated teller machine atm fees and a variety of other deposit account related fees 
income from service charges on deposit accounts represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income generated from service charges on deposit accounts amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing year over year increases of and or and  respectively 
the increase in service charges on deposits compared with was principally attributed to the continued growth of the bank s retail  non maturity deposit account base and  to a lesser extent  increased atm fees reflecting a relatively strong tourist season in the markets served by the bank 
the increase in service charges on deposits compared with was principally attributed to the introduction of a new overdraft protection service  which was launched by the bank in the latter part of the increase also reflected the continued growth of the bank s retail  non maturity deposit base 
credit card service charges and fees this income is principally derived from the bank s merchant credit card transaction processing services  its visa debit card product and  to a lesser extent  fees associated with its visa credit card portfolio 
historically  the bank s merchant credit card activities have been highly seasonal in nature with transaction and fee income volumes peaking in summer and autumn  while declining in winter and spring 
income from credit card service charges and fees represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income generated from credit card service charges and fees amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
the increase in credit card service charges and fees compared with was principally attributed to an increase in debit card fees  reflecting the ongoing growth of the bank s non maturity deposit account base  combined with the highly successful introduction of a new deposit product that offers rewards for debit card transactions 
merchant credit card processing fees also posted an increase  reflecting new business and higher merchant credit card processing volumes compared with the increase in credit and debit card processing fees was greater than the increase in credit and debit card processing expense  which is included in non interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the decline in credit card service charges and fees compared with was principally attributed to lower merchant credit card processing volumes 
the lower volumes were attributed  in part  to the partial relocation of the bank s largest merchant credit card client  combined with intensifying competition from large regional processors 
the declines in merchant credit card processing revenue were more than offset by declines in merchant credit card processing expense  which is included in non interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
while merchant credit card processing profit margins have generally tightened over the past few years  with competition from large regional processors intensifying  the bank has been able to sustain a meaningful revenue stream through new business  increased volumes of transactions  competitive pricing strategies  and the local support offered by a community bank 
net securities gains losses for the year ended december   net securities losses amounted to  compared with net securities gains of and in and  representing a decline of  or and an increase of or  respectively 
in april  the company s board of directors approved the restructuring of a portion of the bank s securities portfolio through the sale of  of its aggregate  available for sale securities  the proceeds from which were initially used to pay down short term borrowings 
since the company no longer had the intent to hold these securities until a recovery of their amortized cost  which may be at maturity  the company recorded an adjustment to write down these securities to fair value at march   resulting in a pre tax impairment loss of  included in first quarter earnings as a reduction of non interest income 
the company s primary objectives were to improve future period earnings and provide a means to more effectively respond to current and future yield curve environments 
the in net securities losses recorded in were comprised of securities impairment losses of  and realized losses of on the sale of securities  offset in part by realized gains on the sale of securities amounting to the recording of securities gains or losses in future reporting periods is uncertain 
however  it is important to note that the available for sale securities portfolio is managed in concert with well structured asset and liability management policies and bank management will continue to respond to changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  changes in securities pre payment or extension risk  changes in the availability of and yields on alternative investments  and the bank s need for adequate liquidity 
other operating income other operating income represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december  total other operating income amounted to  compared with and in and  representing a decline of or and an increase of or  respectively 
the decline in other operating income in compared with was attributed to a gain on the sale of a parcel of real estate adjacent to the bank s southwest harbor  maine branch office recorded in likewise  the increase in other operating income was attributed to this gain on the sale of real estate 
other operating income also includes income from bank owned life insurance boli  representing increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on the lives of certain retired employees who had provided positive consent allowing the bank to be the beneficiary of such policies 
non interest expense for the year ended december   total non interest expense amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing year over year declines of and or and  respectively 
as more fully discussed below  the decline in non interest expense compared with was principally attributed to the settlement of the company s limited post retirement benefit program  the financial impact of which reduced non interest expense by factors contributing to the changes in non interest expense are enumerated in the following discussion and analysis 
salaries and employee benefits for the year ended december   total salaries and employee benefit expenses amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
the relatively small increase in salaries and employee benefits expense compared with was principally attributed to normal employee compensation increases  offset in part by changes in overall staffing levels and mix and certain modifications to employee benefit programs 
the decline in salaries and employee benefits expense compared with was achieved through a variety of factors including lower levels of employee health insurance costs in due to favorable claims experience  changes to employee insurance programs  changes in overall staffing levels and mix  lower levels of incentive compensation  and certain employee severance costs recorded in postretirement plan settlement in  the company settled its limited postretirement benefit program  which funded medical coverage and life insurance benefits to a closed group of active and retired employees who met minimum age and service requirements 
the company voluntarily paid out to plan participants 
this payment fully settled all company obligations related to this program 
in connection with the settlement of the postretirement program  the company recorded a first quarter reduction in non interest expense of  representing the remaining accrued benefit obligation and the actuarial gain related to the program 
occupancy expenses for the year ended december   total occupancy expenses amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decline of or and an increase of or  respectively 
the decline in occupancy expenses compared with was principally attributed to small declines in a variety of expense categories including utilities  grounds keeping and real estate taxes 
the increase in occupancy expenses compared with was principally attributed to the renovation and opening of a new branch office in the community of somesville  maine during the first quarter of the somesville branch office is a leased facility 
furniture and equipment expenses for the year ended december   total furniture and equipment expenses amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decline of or an increase of or  respectively 
the decline in furniture and equipment expenses compared with was attributed to declines in a variety of expense categories including depreciation expense  maintenance contracts  miscellaneous equipment purchases and personal property taxes 
the decline also reflects certain expenses associated with the bank s major renovation and opening of a new branch office in the community of somesville  maine in the increase in furniture and equipment expenses compared with was principally attributed to certain expenses associated with the bank s renovation and opening of a new branch office in the community of somesville  maine in early  combined with certain expenses associated with the upgrade and maintenance of the company s technology infrastructure 
credit card expenses for the year ended december   total credit card expenses amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
credit and debit card expenses principally relate to the bank s merchant credit and debit card processing activities  visa debit card processing expenses and  to a lesser extent  its visa credit card portfolio 
the increase in credit and debit card expenses compared with was principally attributed to increases in the volume of debit card transactions  reflecting the growth of the bank s retail checking account base and the introduction of a new deposit product that provides customer rewards for debit card activity 
merchant credit card processing fees were also moderately higher in  principally reflecting higher merchant credit card processing volumes compared with the increases in credit and debit card expenses were less than the related increases in credit and debit card income  which is included in non interest income in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the decline in credit and debit card expenses compared with was principally attributed to lower merchant credit card processing volumes 
the lower processing volumes were principally attributed to the partial relocation of the bank s largest merchant credit card client and  to a lesser extent  a somewhat slower tourist season in the markets served by the bank compared with other operating expenses for the year ended december   total other operating expenses amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
the increase in other operating expenses compared with was principally attributed to the recording of a liability litigation accrual related to the bank s membership interest in visa inc the bank s merchant services and visa credit card business acquires and issues credit and debit card transactions through visa usa inc card association or its affiliates collectively visa usa 
the bank has a de minimus membership interest in visa usa 
in october  visa  inc visa completed a restructuring including visa usa and issued shares of visa inc common stock to its financial institution members in preparation for its planned initial public offering ipo  anticipated in the first quarter of the visa reorganization 
as a member of visa  the bank has an obligation to indemnify visa usa under its bylaws and visa under a retrospective responsibility plan  approved as part of the visa reorganization  for contingent losses in connection covered litigation the visa indemnification disclosed in visa s public filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  based on its membership proportion 
the bank is not a party to the lawsuits brought against visa usa as part of the visa reorganization  the bank received its proportionate number of class usa shares of visa inc common stock  or  shares 
in connection with the ipo  it is expected that a portion of these shares will be redeemed for cash  with the remaining shares to be converted to class a shares three years after the ipo or upon settlement of the litigation  whichever is later 
additionally  visa is expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from the ipo in an escrow account for the benefit of member financial institutions to fund expenses of the litigation as well as the members proportionate share of any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the litigation 
in november  the sec accounting staff provided preliminary guidance with respect to a number of accounting issues arising out of the visa reorganization 
also in november  visa announced the settlement of the portion of the litigation involving american express 
in december  the sec accounting staff provided further guidance on these accounting matters  including among other things  that visa member institutions are required to recognize their portion of the visa indemnification at the estimated fair value of such obligation in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
while the determination of fair value the bank s visa indemnification is highly judgmental  the company recognized a liability of also as a result of the guidance provided by the sec staff  the company has not reflected in its financial statements any value for the bank s membership interest in visa as a result of the visa reorganization 
upon completion of the anticipated ipo  the fair value of such interest will be realized in the company s financial statements based on the value of shares utilized to establish the escrow account limited to the amount of the obligation recorded and shares redeemed for cash 
company management expects the value of these shares to exceed the charge recorded in excluding the visa litigation charge  other operating expenses totaled  for the year ended december   compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase was principally attributed to moderate increases in a variety of expense categories including telecommunications  charitable contributions and loan collections expense  largely offset by declines in marketing  training  software depreciation  and courier expenses 
the decline in other operating expenses compared with was attributed to declines in a wide variety of expense categories including professional services  equipment maintenance  charitable contributions  loan collection  marketing  public relations  audits and exams  atm processing  and a variety of other miscellaneous expenses 
the decline in other operating expenses reflected management s continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce the company s overall operating overhead 
income taxes for the year ended december   total income taxes amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing year over year increases of and  or and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate in amounted to  compared with and in and  respectively 
the income tax provisions for these periods were less than the expense that would result from applying the federal statutory rate of to income before income taxes  principally because of the impact of tax exempt income on certain investment securities  loans and bank owned life insurance 
fluctuations in the company s effective tax rate are generally attributed to changes in the relationship between non taxable income and non deductible expense  and income before income taxes  during any given reporting period

 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards  which clarifies the accounting for income tax benefits related to the payment of dividends on equity classified employee share based payment awards that are charged to retained earnings under sfas no 
r 
the eitf concluded that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified non vested equity shares  non vested equity share units and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital 
eitf issue no 
should be applied prospectively to the income tax benefits that result from dividends on equity classified employee share based payment awards that are declared in fiscal years beginning after payment awards that are declared in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
retrospective application to previously issued financial statements is prohibited

fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
at the effective date  an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date and report the effect of the first re measurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
subsequent to the effective date  unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are to be reported in earnings 
if the fair value option is elected for any available for sale or held to maturity securities at the effective date  cumulative unrealized gains and losses at that date are included in the cumulative effect adjustment and those securities are to be reported as trading securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  but the accounting for a transfer to the trading category under sfas no 
does not apply 
electing the fair value option for an existing held to maturity security will not call into question the intent of an entity to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities using different measurement attributes 
sfas establishes presentation and disclosure requirements including a requirement to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
 fair value measurements  and sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  january  for the company 
early adoption was permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity made that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also adopts the provisions of sfas at the same time 
the company did not adopt sfas early and does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
the fair value option was not elected for any financial instrument as of january  fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
the expanded disclosures include a requirement to disclose fair value measurements according to a hierarchy  segregating measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs 
sfas no 
applies only to fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards and does not impose requirements for additional fair value measures 
sfas no 
was issued to increase consistency and comparability in reporting fair values 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within that fiscal year january  for the company 
the provisions are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is applied  with certain exceptions 
a transition adjustment  measured as the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values of certain specific financial instruments at the date sfas no 
is initially applied  is to be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
while sfas no 
will affect certain of the company s fair value disclosures  it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the responsibility for interest rate risk management oversight is the function of the bank s asset and liability committee alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of various members of senior management 
alco meets regularly to review balance sheet structure  formulate strategies in light of current and expected economic conditions  adjust product prices as necessary  implement policy  monitor liquidity  and review performance against guidelines established to control exposure to the various types of inherent risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re pricing  maturity and or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities 
management s objectives are to measure  monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the bank s balance sheet 
the objectives in managing the bank s balance sheet are to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates  and to enhance profitability through strategies that promote sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk 
the bank s interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re pricing and cash flow attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates 
the level of interest rate risk  measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income  is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk is evaluated in depth on a quarterly basis and reviewed by the bank s alco and board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management policy  approved annually by the bank s board of directors  establishes interest rate risk limits in terms of variability of net interest income under rising  flat  and decreasing rate scenarios 
it is the role of alco to evaluate the overall risk profile and to determine actions to maintain and achieve a posture consistent with policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of two complementary measures static gap analysis gap and interest rate sensitivity modeling 
while each measurement may have its limitations  taken together they form a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of the bank s interest rate risk  the level of risk over time  and the quantification of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap analysis interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and re pricing characteristics of the bank s on and off balance sheet positions 
gap is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities re pricing or maturing within specified periods 
an asset sensitive position  or positive gap  indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities re pricing or maturing within a specified time period  which would imply a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position  or negative gap  generally implies a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
the bank s static interest rate sensitivity gap is summarized below interest rate risk cumulative static gap position december  and one day to six months over six months to one year over one to two years december  december  change the bank s december  cumulative interest rate risk sensitivity static gap position indicated that the bank s balance sheet was liability sensitive over the twelve month horizon and was moderately asset sensitive beyond the twelve month horizon 
comparing with  the liability sensitivity of the bank s balance sheet declined 
changes in the bank s cumulative static gap position from the prior year principally reflect higher levels of longer term funding  and overall changes in the maturity and re pricing mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  pursuant to the bank s asset and liability management strategy  management extended the maturities on a portion of its wholesale funding base during  in order to lessen the bank s exposure to rising interest rates 
there are certain limitations inherent in static gap analysis 
these limitations include the fact that it is a static measurement and it does not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond non proportionally to changes in market interest rates 
although alco reviews all data used in the model in detail  assets and liabilities do not always have clear re pricing dates  and re pricing may occur earlier or later than assumed in the model 
interest rate sensitivity modeling the bank utilizes an interest rate risk model widely recognized in the financial industry to monitor and measure interest rate risk 
the model simulates the behavior of interest income and expense for all balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments  under different interest rate scenarios together with a dynamic future balance sheet 
interest rate risk is measured in terms of potential changes in net interest income based upon shifts in the yield curve 
the interest rate risk sensitivity model requires that assets and liabilities be broken down into components as to fixed  variable  and adjustable interest rates  as well as other homogeneous groupings  which are segregated as to maturity and type of instrument 
the model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time and in different interest rate environments 
the model uses contractual re pricing dates for variable products  contractual maturities for fixed rate products  and product specific assumptions for deposit accounts  such as money market accounts  that are subject to re pricing based on current market conditions 
re pricing margins are also determined for adjustable rate assets and incorporated in the model 
investment securities and borrowings with call provisions  are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of a call 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds  based upon similar coupon ranges and degree of seasoning 
cash flows and maturities are then determined  and for certain assets  prepayment assumptions are estimated under different interest rate scenarios 
interest income and interest expense are then simulated under several hypothetical interest rate conditions including a flat interest rate scenario in which current prevailing rates are locked in and the only balance sheet fluctuations that occur are due to cash flows  maturities  new volumes  and re pricing volumes consistent with this flat rate assumption  a basis point rise or decline in interest rates applied against a parallel shift in the yield curve over a twelve month horizon together with a dynamic balance sheet anticipated to be consistent with such interest rate changes  various non parallel shifts in the yield curve  including changes in either short term or long term rates over a twelve month horizon  together with a dynamic balance sheet anticipated to be consistent with such interest rate changes  and an extension of the foregoing simulations to each of two  three  four and five year horizons to determine the interest rate risk with the level of interest rates stabilizing in years two through five 
even though rates remain stable during this two to five year time period  re pricing opportunities driven by maturities  cash flow  and adjustable rate products will continue to change the balance sheet profile for each of the interest rate conditions 
changes in net interest income based upon the foregoing simulations are measured against the flat interest rate scenario and actions are taken to maintain the balance sheet interest rate risk within established policy guidelines 
the following table summarizes the bank s net interest income sensitivity analysis as of december   over one and two year horizons and under different interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk changes in net interest income from the flat rate scenario december  basis points parallel yield curve shift basis points parallel yield curve shift basis points short term rates year net interest income change net interest income change year net interest income change net interest income change the foregoing interest rate sensitivity modeling results indicate that the bank s balance sheet is liability sensitive and is favorably positioned for declining interest rates over the one and two year horizons 
the interest rate sensitivity model also suggests that the bank is moderately exposed to a parallel increase in short term and long term rates over the one and two year horizons but  as discussed below  management believes that this is a scenario that is less likely to occur 
assuming interest rates remain at or near their current levels and the bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels  the interest rate sensitivity simulation model suggests that net interest income will trend moderately upward over the one and two year horizons and beyond 
the upward trend principally results from the downward re pricing of a large portion of the bank s short term funding base in response to the basis point reduction in the fed funds rate in late  unlike the bank s fixed rate earning asset portfolios which were generally not impacted by the declining fed funds rate 
the upward trend also reflects the re investment of a portion of securities and loan cash flows into higher current interest rate levels 
management anticipates that only moderate earning asset growth would be needed to meaningfully increase the bank s current level of net interest income  should interest rates remain at current levels 
assuming short term and long term interest rates decline from current levels ie  a parallel yield curve shift and the bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels  management believes net interest income will increase over the one and two year horizons 
the interest rate sensitivity simulation model suggests that funding cost reductions will outpace falling asset yields  favorably impacting net interest income 
while the interest rate sensitivity model suggests that net interest income will be pressured by accelerated cash flows on earning assets and the re pricing of the bank s earning asset base  management believes this is a scenario that is not likely to occur 
in this regard  at december  long term interest rates continued below historical norms  with the year us treasury note closing the year at 
management believes that a basis point decline in long term interest rates  or a year us treasury note of  would be unprecedented and unlikely to occur 
notwithstanding  management anticipates that only moderate earning asset growth will be needed to meaningfully increase the bank s current level of net interest income should both long term and short term interest rates decline in parallel 
the interest rate sensitivity model is used to evaluate the impact on net interest income given certain non parallel shifts in the yield curve  including changes in either short term or long term interest rates 
given the shape of the yield curve at december  combined with the prospect of further interest rate reductions by the federal reserve  management modeled alternative future interest rate scenarios and the anticipated impact on net interest income 
assuming the bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels  with the short term federal funds interest rate declining basis points  and with the balance of the yield curve returning to its historical ten year average  the interest rate sensitivity model suggests that net interest income will significantly improve over the twelve month horizon and continue to strengthen over the twenty four month horizon 
the model indicates that funding costs will show significant declines while earning asset yields will only decline moderately 
in addition  loan and securities cash flows will be reinvested into higher yielding earning assets 
management believes the foregoing scenario is more likely than a parallel basis point decline in short and long term interest rates  given the current shape of the yield curve 
management also believes this scenario will significantly increase net interest income without the benefit of earning asset growth 
assuming the bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels and the federal reserve increases short term interest rates by basis points  and the balance of the yield curve shifts in parallel with these increases  management believes net interest income will post moderate declines over the twelve and twenty four month horizons  and then begin a steady recovery 
the interest rate sensitivity simulation model suggests that as interest rates rise  the bank s funding costs will re price more quickly than its earning asset portfolios  causing a decline in net interest income 
as funding costs begin to stabilize towards the end of the second year of the simulation  the earning asset portfolios continue to re price at prevailing interest rate levels and cash flows from earning asset portfolios will be reinvested into higher yielding earning assets  resulting in a widening of spreads and improving levels of net interest income 
management believes that strong earning asset growth will be necessary to increase the current level of net interest income should short and long term interest rates rise in parallel 
management also believes that  based on a variety of current economic indicators  it is not likely the federal reserve will increase short term interest rates any time in the near future 
notwithstanding this consideration  management has the ability to respond to anticipated or potential changes in interest rates in order to protect future levels of net interest income 
for example  to protect against rising interest rates  longer term funding  which is currently at cyclical interest rate lows  could be added to the balance sheet as short term funding maturities come due 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shape  prepayment speeds on loans and securities  deposit rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results may also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other such variables 
the sensitivity analysis also does not reflect additional actions that the bank s alco and board of directors might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates  and the anticipated impact on the bank s net interest income 
the bank engages an independent consultant to periodically review its interest rate risk position and the reasonableness of assumptions used  with periodic reports provided to the bank s board of directors 
at december   there were no significant differences between the views of the independent consultant and management regarding the bank s interest rate risk exposure 
the following table summarizes the bank s net interest income sensitivity analysis that was prepared as of december   over one and two year horizons  and assuming a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the table also summarizes net interest income sensitivity under a non parallel shift in the yield curve  whereby short term rates declined by basis points 
interest rate risk change in net interest income from the flat rate scenario december  basis points parallel yield curve shift basis points parallel yield curve shift basis points short term rates year net interest income change net interest income change year net interest income change net interest income change during the first nine months of  short term interest rate fed funds remained unchanged 
as had been anticipated by management through use of the interest rate sensitivity model in a flat rate scenario  the bank s net interest income growth of during that period was largely a reflection of earning asset growth 
from september  to december   the federal reserve decreased short term interest rates three times for a total of basis points 
as was anticipated by management through use of the interest rate sensitivity model  the bank s net interest income was favorable impacted by the decline in short term interest rates 
while the full impact of interest rate reductions are typically not immediate  the bank s fourth quarter net interest margin was up basis points over the same quarter in and basis points on a linked quarter basis
