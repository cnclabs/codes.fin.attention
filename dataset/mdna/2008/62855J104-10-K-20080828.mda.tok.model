item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading healthcare company focused on the development and marketing of novel molecular diagnostic and therapeutic products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that permit us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new healthcare products that are designed to treat major diseases and assess a person s risk of disease later in life 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our three reportable operating segments research  which focuses on the discovery of genes related to major common diseases  molecular diagnostics  which focuses on the analysis of genes and their alterations to assess the risk for developing disease later in life predictive medicine and to assess the risk of disease progression  disease recurrence  drug toxicity  and drug response personalized medicine  and drug development  which focuses on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment and prevention of major diseases 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding these operating segments 
until the fiscal year ended june   our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of molecular diagnostic products and research payments 
during the year ended june   we reported a net income of million 
in fiscal  our revenue included million in pharmaceutical revenue  consisting of a non refundable upfront fee received from h 
lundbeck a s lundbeck  in connection with an agreement we entered into with lundbeck for european commercialization of our former alzheimer s disease therapeutic candidate  flurizan 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and respectively 
our research and development expenses include costs incurred for our drug candidates currently in human clinical trials  including azixa  vivecon  mpc  and mpc currently  the only costs we track by each drug candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by clinical research organizations  manufacturing of drug supply  and other outsourced research 
we do not assign to each drug candidate our internal costs such as salaries and benefits  facilities costs  lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies 
all research and development costs for our drug candidates are expensed as incurred 
the timing and amount of any future expenses  completion dates  and revenues for our drug candidates is not readily determinable due to the early stage of development of those candidates 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates 
while expenses associated with the completion of our current clinical programs are expected to be substantial and increase  we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including the scope  rate of progress  and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials  the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  our ability to market  commercialize  manufacture and supply  and achieve market acceptance for our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  and the filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 

table of contents a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our therapeutic and molecular diagnostic businesses 
we expect that earnings will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and share based payment expense 
revenue recognition 
molecular diagnostic revenue includes revenue from the sale of molecular diagnostic products and related marketing agreements  and is recorded at the invoiced amount net of any discounts or allowances 
molecular diagnostic revenue is recognized upon completion of the test  communication of results  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where the company has continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period or upon termination of a development or license agreement when the company has no ongoing obligation research revenue includes revenue from research agreements  milestone payments  and technology licensing agreements 
in applying the principles of sab and eitf to research and technology license agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  as underlying research costs are incurred  or on the basis of contractually defined output measures such as units delivered 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in our calculations as work progresses and we gain experience 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
payments received on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as other receivables or deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from milestone payments for which we have no continuing performance obligations is recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
when we have continuing performance obligations  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
we recognize revenue from up front nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period of our continued involvement in the research and development project 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our molecular diagnostic products  which are recorded net of any discounts or contractual allowances 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations or financial position  however  to date these changes have not been material 
it is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods 

table of contents after a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  and  we have determined that a hypothetical ten percent increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts would result in additional bad debt expense and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
share based payment expense 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires us to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 or sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our adoption of sfas on july  is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard by us on july  is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r replaced sfas no 
 business combinations  originally issued in june sfas r retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
generally  sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations completed on or after january  we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of those potential impacts 
in december  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf provides guidance concerning determining whether an arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangement within the scope of the issue  how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties should be reported in the income statement  how an entity should characterize payments on the income statement  and what participants should disclose in the notes to the financial statements about a collaborative arrangement 
the provisions of eitf will be adopted in we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting eitf on our financial statements 
results of operations years ended june  and molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised primarily of sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
molecular diagnostic revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
this increase in molecular diagnostic revenue is primarily attributable to increased testing volume 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  we are currently in the process of expanding our sales force  executing a public awareness marketing campaign  and increasing our market penetration in the ob gyn market 
through these efforts we are attempting to broaden 
table of contents utilization of our products with current physician customers and increase the number of new physician customers prescribing our products 
we believe these efforts will allow us to continue to grow molecular diagnostic revenue in future periods  however  there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic revenue will continue to increase at historical rates 
pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of co marketing agreement payments received relating to a therapeutic product 
on may   we entered into an agreement with lundbeck for european commercialization of our former alzheimer s disease therapeutic candidate  flurizan 
as consideration for entering into the agreement we received a million non refundable upfront fee which we expected to recognize over years 
on june   we announced the results of our us month phase study of flurizan in patients with mild alzheimer s disease 
the study did not achieve statistical significance on either of its primary endpoints cognition and activities of daily living 
as a result we discontinued all ongoing flurizan clinical studies  including our global phase trial  and have no further performance obligations under the agreement 
the discontinuance of the flurizan development program and any ongoing development activity related to flurizan resulted in the recognition of of the full million upfront fee as pharmaceutical revenue in fiscal research and other revenue is comprised of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements 
research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of research collaborations during research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and outputs increase or decrease  revenue may increase or decrease proportionately 
in the future we expect to continue to de emphasize external collaborations 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  royalty payments  equipment costs and facilities expense 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic gross profit margins will continue to increase and we expect that our gross profit margins will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the introduction of new products as well as new technologies and operating systems in our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  equipments cost  facilities expense  and costs associated with our clinical trials 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to one time sub license costs of approximately million being claimed under our license agreement with encore pharmaceuticals  inc based on license revenue under our lundbeck co marketing agreement with lundbeck  increased costs of approximately million associated with our pharmaceutical development programs  increased costs of approximately million associated with our molecular diagnostic research programs  and increased sfas r share based payment expense of approximately million 
we expect our research and development expenses will fluxuate over the next several years as we develop additional molecular diagnostic products  conduct additional clinical trials to support the potential commercialization of our product candidates currently in clinical development  including azixa  vivecon  and mpc  advance our other product candidates into clinical trials  and expand our research and development activities 
in the near term  we expect these expenses to be lower than recent historical levels due to the termination of our flurizan development program 
we also expect to incur some ancillary expenses in connection with the termination of our flurizan development program which may be significant in amount 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collection  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human 
table of contents resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million to support the growth in our molecular diagnostic revenues  which included the expansion of our oncology and ob gyn sales force  as well as commissions  travel  and initiative programs  expansion of our commercialization efforts to support the anticipated product launch of flurizan which resulted in an increase of approximately million  an increase of million in bad debt expense with resulted from growth in our molecular diagnostic sales  increased marketing costs of approximately million associated with the launch of our public awareness campaign for our bracanalysis predictive medicine product  general increases in expenses of approximately million to support growth in administrative support and facility costs  general increases in costs of approximately million to support growth in our molecular diagnostic business and therapeutic development efforts  and increased sfas r share based payment expense of approximately million 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on the number and scope of any new product launches  our efforts in support of our existing molecular diagnostic products  and our drug discovery and drug development efforts 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities 
other income and expense for the fiscal year ended june  decreased million from income of million for the fiscal year ended june  to million expense for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease is primarily attributable to the write off of million in our preferred stock investment in encore pharmaceuticals as a result of our discontinuation of the flurizan development program 
years ended june  and molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised primarily of sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
molecular diagnostic revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of a research collaboration in the prior year 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and outputs increase or decrease  revenue may increase or decrease proportionately 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials of flurizan and azixa 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing commissions  headcount  and related costs to support the growth in our molecular diagnostic business  which resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year  
table of contents marketing costs associated with the preparation of a direct to consumer advertising campaign  which resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year  increased bad debt expense  which resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year  increased share based payment expense of approximately million compared to the prior fiscal year  and general increases in costs to support growth in our molecular diagnostic business and therapeutic development efforts  which resulted in an increase of approximately million compared to the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities increased million  or  from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily attributable to receipt of a million cash payment received from lundbeck under the co marketing agreement for flurizan  cash generated from our molecular diagnostic revenue and  to a lesser extent  research collaboration payments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  warrants  and sales of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
this increase was partially offset by expenditures for our ongoing clinical trials  internal research and drug development programs  acquisition of capital assets  and other expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
trade receivables increased million between june  and june   primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic sales during the same period 
accounts payable increased by million and accrued liabilities increased million between june  and june   primarily due to amounts owed related to our ongoing clinical trials and a maximum license fee of million that may be payable in connection with our co marketing agreement with lundbeck 
our investing activities used cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in investing activities during the prior fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended june   purchases of marketable investment securities used cash of million  maturities of marketable investment securities provided cash of million  and capital expenditures for research equipment used cash of million 
financing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and provided cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is attributed primarily to net proceeds of million received in the prior year from an underwritten offering of million shares of our common stock pursuant to our outstanding shelf registration statement on form s registration no 

as of june   we have approximately million of securities available for sale under this shelf registration statement 
during the fiscal year ended june   we received million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of our common stock from our employee stock purchase plan and million from the exercise of warrants 
we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time and we may need or want to raise additional financing within this period of time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us  including the progress and results of our current phase clinical trials of azixa for the treatment of cancer and any additional trials that we may initiate based on the phase results  the progress and results of our phase clinical trials for vivecon and mpc and any future trials that we may initiate based on the phase results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
we currently hold million in securities  classified as marketable investment securities  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed 
we have determined that any change in fair value to these auction rate securities would not have a material impact upon our financial statements  taken as a whole 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
