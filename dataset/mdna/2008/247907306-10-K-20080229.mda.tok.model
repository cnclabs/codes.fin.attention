item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a denver  colorado based independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the exploration for  and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil 
our core areas of operation are the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions  which comprise the majority of our proved reserves  production and long term growth prospects 
we have a significant drilling inventory that consists of proved and unproved locations  the majority of which are located in our rocky mountain development projects 
at december   we had estimated proved reserves that totaled bcfe  of which were proved developed  with an after tax pv value of million 
as of december   we achieved net production of mmcfe per day and net continuing production of mmcfe per day 
as of december   our reserves were comprised of approximately bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil  or gas on an equivalent basis 
approximately of our proved reserves were located in the gulf coast  in the rocky mountains  and in other locations 
we expect that our drilling efforts and capital expenditures will focus increasingly on the rockies  where approximately of our fiscal drilling budget is allocated and more than one half of our undeveloped acreage is located 
as of december   we controlled approximately  net undeveloped acres  representing approximately of our total acreage position 
we retain a high degree of operational control over our asset base  with an average working interest in excess of excluding crb properties as of december  this provides us with controlling interests in a multi year inventory of drilling locations  positioning us for continued reserve and production growth through our drilling operations 
we also have a controlling ownership interest in a drilling company  providing the benefit of access to drilling rigs primarily located in the rocky mountain region 
we concentrate our exploration and development efforts in fields where we can apply our technical exploration and development expertise  and where we have accumulated significant operational control and experience 
outlook we expect our oil and gas production to increase to due to the expected results of our budgeted drilling program 
for calendar year  we have preliminarily established a drilling budget of approximately to million 
we are concentrating a substantial portion of this budget on the development of our paradox  piceance and wind river basin assets in the rockies  and to a lesser extent  our newton and midway loop fields in the gulf coast 
state of the art geologic and seismic geophysical modeling indicates that these fields have targeted geologic formations containing substantial hydrocarbon deposits that can be economically developed 
recently completed successful wells in several of our rocky mountain development programs have found multiple accumulations of tight sand reservoirs at various depths  characterized by low permeability and high pressure 
these types of reservoirs possess predictable geologic attributes and consistent reservoir characteristics which typically result in a higher drilling success rate and lower per well cost and risk 
the exploration for and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil are highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating reserve and production growth represents an ongoing focus for management  and is made particularly important in our business by the natural production and reserve decline associated with oil and gas properties 
in addition to developing new reserves  we compete to acquire additional reserves  which involves judgments regarding recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  third party contractor and material cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
other challenges we face include attracting and retaining qualified personnel  gaining access to equipment and supplies and maintaining access to capital on sufficiently favorable terms 
we have taken the following steps to mitigate the challenges we face 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  typically costless collars 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our review of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
as of february   our derivative contracts cover approximately bcfe of our estimated oil and gas production 
our interest in a drilling and trucking company allows us to mitigate the increasing challenge for rig availability in the rocky mountains and also helps to control third party contractor and material costs 
our business strengths include a multi year inventory of attractive drilling locations and a diverse balance of high return gulf coast properties and long lived rockies reserves  which we believe will allow us to grow reserves and replace and expand production organically without having to rely solely on acquisitions 
recent developments during the year ended december   we achieved the following increased proved reserves to bcfe at december   an increase of  or after considering current year sales and purchases  compared to proved reserves as of december  of bcfe 
our total production for the year ended december  was bcfe 
adjusted for asset dispositions  our production from continuing operations increased to bcfe  compared to bcfe for the prior year period  primarily as a result of successful exploratory and development drilling during results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to items that have affected our results of operations for the years ended december   and  six months ended december  and  and the fiscal year ended june  during  we changed our fiscal year end from june to december  effective december  accordingly  we have presented below for comparative purposes unaudited historical statements of operations for the year ended december  and six months ended december  the following table sets forth in thousands  for the periods presented  selected historical statements of operations data 
the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k

net loss was million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  or 
per diluted common share  for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations increased from million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the year ended december   due primarily to dry hole costs and impairments  first half gains on undeveloped property sales and gains on ineffective derivative instruments that did not occur during  and due to higher depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense  and increased general and administrative expense in net loss increased significantly due to the valuation allowance required to be recorded against the company s deferred tax assets during the second quarter of oil and gas sales 
during the year ended december   oil and gas sales from continuing operations were million  as compared to million for the comparable period a year earlier 
during the year ended december   production from continuing operations increased by  however  this was offset by a decrease in the average gas price 
the average onshore gas price received during the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf for the year earlier period  primarily due to the increase in the basis differential applicable to rocky mountain natural gas 
the average onshore oil price received during the year ended december  increased to per bbl compared to per bbl for the year earlier period and the offshore oil price increased to per bbl during the year ended december  compared to for the year earlier period 
net gains losses from effective hedging activities were a million gain and a million loss for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the gain in realized hedges is primarily due to lower oil and gas prices 
these gains losses are recorded as an increase or decrease in revenues 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although approximately half are currently working for third party operators 
drilling revenues for the year ended december  remained flat at million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling revenue is earned under daywork or turnkey contracts where we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our third party customers who supervise the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use or on a negotiated fixed rate for drilling to a certain depth 
during the mobilization period we typically earn a fixed amount of revenue based on the mobilization rate set in the contract 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
trucking revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year period 
trucking revenues decreased in due to fewer rigs being transported in wyoming where c l drilling operates 
production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  onshore offshore onshore offshore production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf production discontinued operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations hedge gain loss lease operating expense production taxes transportation costs depletion expense revised for operations discontinued in lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year earlier period 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for onshore properties for the year ended december  was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the year earlier period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year earlier period 
depletion expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in depletion expense was due to a increase in production from continuing operations  slightly offset by a decrease in the onshore depletion rate 
our onshore depletion rate decreased to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year earlier period 
the decrease is partially due to lower finding costs per mcfe on the company s extensive rockies drilling program 
based on impairments recorded in and the company s continued focus in the rockies which continues to result in better well economics  the company anticipates its depletion rate will continue to decrease in depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
this increase can be attributed to a greater average number of rigs that dhs owned in compared to the prior year 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year earlier period 
current year exploration activities increased and included the acquisition and processing of the seismic program related to acreage in opossum hollow  texas  processing for d seismic costs in the central utah hingeline  and d seismic costs to evaluate leasehold positions for additional drilling locations in wyoming 
dry hole costs and impairments 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period a year ago 
for the year ended december   our dry hole costs related primarily to seven exploratory projects  three in texas  two in wyoming  one well in colorado and one in utah 
for the year ended december   the dry hole costs related primarily to exploratory projects in texas and utah 
during the year ended december   the company recorded impairments totaling approximately million primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties that are held for sale at december  drilling and trucking operations 
we had drilling and trucking operations expense of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the significant increase in expenses was due to the greater average overall number of rigs in operation for dhs in than in the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to an increase in non cash equity compensation of million and a increase in technical and administrative staff and related personnel costs 
gain on sale of oil and gas properties 
in january and march  delta sold a combined minority interest in crbp 
as the sale involved unproved properties  no gain on the partial sale of crbp could be recognized until all of the cost basis of crbp had been recovered 
accordingly  we recorded a million gain million net of tax  and an million reduction to property during the first quarter of as a result of closing the transaction 
in november  we sold certain undeveloped property interests in the columbia river basin for proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain on the transaction of million 
in march  we sold approximately of pgr 
this transaction involved both proved and unproved property interests and accordingly  to the extent the sale of pgr related to unproved properties  no gain could be recognized as all of the unproved cost basis was not yet recovered 
we recorded a gain of million  million net of tax  and a million offset to property during the first quarter of as a result of the transaction 
we retained a interest in  and are the manager of  pgr 
gain on sale of investment in lng project 
on march   we sold our long term minority interest investment in an lng project for total proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain on sale of million  net of tax 
gain loss on ineffective derivative instruments  net 
effective july   we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting 
beginning july   we recognize mark to market gains and losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income for the contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges 
as a result  we recognized in our statements of operations a loss of million for the year ended december  and a gain of million for the year ended december  minority interest 
minority interest represents the minority investors percentage of their share of income or losses from dhs in which they hold an interest 
during the year ended december  dhs generated a loss resulting in decreased minority interest expense 
interest and financing costs  net 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable year earlier period 
the increase is primarily related to higher average debt balances on dhs credit facility during the year and costs related to the refinancing of dhs credit facilities in may and december  offset by lower average balances outstanding on delta s credit facility 
income tax expense 
due to our continued losses  we were required by the more likely than not provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets beginning with the second quarter of as a result  our income tax expense for the year ended december  of million includes a valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   an income tax benefit of million was recorded for continuing operations at an effective tax rate of 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include the frisco field in pointe coupee parish  louisiana  which was sold in june  the panola and rusk county  texas properties  which were sold in august  the east texas and pennsylvania properties  which were sold in august  the kansas field  which was sold in january  the australia field and the new mexico and east texas properties  which were sold in march  the north dakota properties sold in september  the washington county  colorado properties sold in october  and the midway loop  texas properties held for sale at december  the results of operations on these assets  net of tax  during the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the significant increase in was primarily due to new wells in from the company s midway loop drilling program or wells drilled in impacting sales for the full year in gain loss on sale of discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we sold non core properties in colorado  kansas  texas  new mexico  australia and north dakota for combined proceeds of million and a combined net loss of million 
during the year ended december   we sold certain non core properties located in louisiana and east texas for combined proceeds of million and an after tax gain of million 
extraordinary gain 
on august   the company completed the sale of the properties acquired with the castle acquisition in april during the year ended december  the company recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of tax in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  unaudited net income 
net income decreased million to  or 
per diluted common share  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted common share  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an million increase in operating losses resulting from higher revenue and a million gain on the sale of oil and gas properties  offset by higher depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense  higher exploration  dry hole and abandonment costs  and increased general and administrative expenses 
oil and gas sales 
during the year ended december   oil and natural gas revenue from continuing operations increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of a increase in average daily production from continuing operations over the year ended december   an increase in average onshore oil price received in the year ended december  of per bbl compared to per bbl during the same period in  and an increase in offshore oil price received of per bbl during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in the average onshore gas price received during the year ended december  of per mcf compared to per mcf received in the year ended december  net realized losses from effective hedging activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in in realized hedging losses is primarily due to higher oil prices 
these losses are recorded as a decrease in total revenues 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although approximately three fourths were working for third party operators at december  drilling revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling revenue is earned under daywork contracts where we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our third party customers who supervise the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use 
during the mobilization period we typically earn a fixed amount of revenue based on the mobilization rate set in the contract 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
at december  there were dhs rigs in operation compared to eight rigs in operation at december  trucking revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the prior year period 
trucking revenues were insignificant during the year ended december  as the acquisition of chapman trucking company was completed in november  production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  onshore offshore onshore offshore production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf production discontinued operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations hedge gain loss lease operating expense production taxes transportation costs depletion expense revised for operations discontinued in lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
lease operating expense increased due to our increase in production and due to increased per unit costs 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for onshore properties for the year ended december  was per mcfe as compared to 
per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for offshore properties was per mcfe for the year ended december  and per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
the increase in onshore per unit lease operating expenses is a result of generally rising field costs due to increased demand for services  and is also affected by overall infrastructure costs for some properties that were still experiencing limited production due to pipeline constraints 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million in the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  depletion expenses for our onshore properties increased to per mcfe during the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  the depletion rate increase is partially due to certain deep  multi stage completion projects in which the majority of our well costs are depleted over completed zones that have not met initial expectations 
also  during the year ended december   a million developmental dry hole in south angleton was added to the depletion pool 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
this increase can be attributed to additional rigs acquired by dhs drilling company 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  activities in the year ended december  included activities in our columbia river basin  washington  grand county  utah and newton county  texas projects 
during the year ended december   our most significant exploration cost was related to the million newton d seismic shoot covering square miles which was completed and processed during in addition  we acquired d data in the gulf coast region and also began acquiring geophysical data on the columbia river basin properties in the state of washington 
dry hole costs and impairments 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
during  a significant portion of these costs were related to dry holes that were drilled in utah and california 
for the year ended december   the dry hole costs related primarily to exploratory projects in texas and utah 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties that were held for sale at december  during  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future quarters our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
during the year ended december   a dry hole was drilled on a prospect located in california 
based on drilling results and evaluation of the prospect  we determined that we would not pursue development and accordingly an impairment of million was recorded for the full impairment of the remaining leasehold costs related to the prospect 
drilling and trucking operations 
we had drilling and trucking operations expense of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the significant increase in expenses was due to an increase in the number of rigs in operation  rigs as of december  compared to eight rigs at december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to an increase in non cash equity compensation of million  a increase in technical and administrative staff and related personnel costs  and the expansion of our office facility 
in addition  million of the increase is related to dhs general and administrative expense 
dhs general and administrative expense increased with added headcount for dhs growth during the year ended december  and a full year of operations in compared to nine months of operations in gain on sale of oil and gas properties 
during december  delta transferred its ownership in approximately  gross acres  net acres of non operated interests in the columbia river basin to crbp 
in january and march  delta sold a combined minority interest in crbp 
accordingly  the company recorded a million gain million  net of tax and a million reduction to property during the first quarter of as a result of the closing of the transaction 
in november  the company sold certain undeveloped property interests in the columbia river basin for proceeds of million 
the company recorded a gain on the transaction of million 
in march  the company sold approximately of pgr 
this transaction involved both proved and unproved property interests and accordingly  to the extent the sale of pgr related to unproved properties  no gain could be recognized as all of the unproved cost basis was not yet recovered 
the company recorded a gain of million  million net of tax  and a million offset to property during the first quarter of as a result of the transaction 
the company retained a interest in  and is the manager of  pgr

gain on sale of investment in lng project 
on march   the company sold its long term minority interest investment in an lng project for total proceeds of million 
the company recorded a gain on sale of million  net of tax 
gain loss on ineffective derivative instruments  net 
during the year ended december   our gas derivative contracts became ineffective and no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness results from different changes in the nymex contract terms and the physical location  grade and quality of our oil and gas production 
the change in fair value of our nymex gas contracts is reflected in earnings  as opposed to being recorded in other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
as a result  we recognized an million gain and a million loss in our statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as commodity prices fluctuate  we will record our nymex gas derivative contracts at market value with any changes in market value recorded through unrealized gain loss on derivative contracts in our statement of operations 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the minority investors percentage of their share of income or losses from dhs in which they hold an interest 
during the year ended december  dhs generated a greater profit  resulting in increased minority interest expense 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to the increase in the average amount outstanding under our credit facility  higher interest rates and the increased long term debt balance related to the dhs credit facility 
in addition  during  dhs incurred a pre payment penalty of  and wrote off deferred financing costs of  to pay off a term loan that was replaced with a lower interest rate term loan 
income tax benefit 
during the year ended december   an income tax benefit of million was recorded for continuing operations at an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax benefit of million and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the rate was significantly affected by the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the company s deferred tax assets 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include the deerlick creek field in tuscaloosa county  alabama  which was sold in september  the frisco field in pointe coupee parish  louisiana  which was sold in june  the panola and rusk county  texas properties  which were sold in august  the east texas and pennsylvania properties  which were sold in august  and the kansas field  which was sold in january  the australia field and the new mexico and east texas properties  which were sold in march  the north dakota properties sold in september  the washington county  colorado properties sold in october  and the midway loop  texas properties held for sale at december  the results of operations on these assets  net of tax  during the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
extraordinary gain 
an extraordinary gain was recorded during the year ended december  as required by sfas due to the excess fair value of the assets compared to the purchase price of the transaction and the company s intention to sell the oil and gas properties  delta recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of tax  during the year ended december  the oil and gas properties acquired from castle were in fact sold during august six months ended december  compared to six months ended december  unaudited net income 
net income decreased million to a net loss of  or 
per diluted common share for the six months ended december   as compared to net income of million or 
per diluted common share for the six months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million loss for ineffective hedges  million of realized losses on effective hedging contracts  higher exploration and dry hole costs  increased general and administrative expenses of million due to the growth in the company s operations and activities  and increased interest and financing costs of million due to higher average debt outstanding 
revenue 
during the six months ended december   oil and natural gas revenue from continuing operations increased to million  as compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase was the result of an average onshore gas price received during the six months ended december  of per mcf compared to per mcf received in the six months ended december   an increase in average onshore oil price received in the six months ended december  of per bbl compared to per bbl during the same period in  an increase in offshore oil price received of per bbl during the six months ended december  compared to during the six months ended december   and a increase in continuing average daily production over the six months ended december  cash payments required on our effective hedging activities impacted revenues during the six months ended december  and the cost of settling our effective hedging activities was million and  during the six months ended december  and  respectively 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned eleven drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
in early  two additional rigs were acquired 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although approximately half were working for third party operators at december  drilling revenues for the six months ended december  increased to million compared to  for the prior year period 
drilling revenue is earned under daywork contracts where we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our third party customers who supervise the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use 
during the mobilization period we typically earn a fixed amount of revenue based on the mobilization rate set in the contract 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
at december  there were eight dhs rigs in operation compared to four rigs in operation at june  trucking revenues were insignificant during the six months ended december  as the chapman acquisition was completed in november production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the six months ended december  and are as follows six months ended december  onshore offshore onshore offshore production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf production discontinued operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations hedge gain loss lease operating expense production taxes benefit transportation costs depletion expense revised for operations discontinued in lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses for the six months ended december  were million compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for onshore properties for the six months ended december  was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for offshore properties was per mcfe for the six months ended december  and per mcfe for the same period a year earlier 
this increase in lease operating costs from continuing operations per mcfe can be primarily attributed to the increase in the percentage of wells owned in the gulf coast region  largely due to the manti acquisition in january  as compared to our other regions 
our gulf coast properties typically have higher average lease operating costs 
newton also experienced substantial costs related to compression and salt water hauling and disposal 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million in the six months ended december   as compared to million for the six months ended december  depreciation expenses for our onshore properties increased to per mcfe during the six months ended december  from per mcfe for the six months ended december  depletion rates have increased based on the higher amounts paid to acquire reserves in the ground and the increase in drilling costs relative to reserve additions 
we also incurred higher depletion rates caused by lower proved developed producing reserves in our south angleton field from unsuccessful drilling results 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking increased to million for the six months ended december  as compared to  for the prior year period 
this increase can be attributed to additional rigs acquired by dhs drilling company 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the six months ended december  were million compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase in exploration costs was primarily related to seismic costs and impairment of prospect acquisition costs 
during the six months ended december   our most significant exploration cost related to the million newton d seismic shoot covering square miles which was completed and processed during and which assisted us in prioritizing our drilling locations and identifying target formations 
in addition  we acquired d data in the gulf coast region and also began acquiring geophysical data on the columbia river basin properties in the state of washington 
dry hole costs and impairments 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the six months ended december  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
during  a significant portion of these costs related to our trail blazer prospect in laramie county  wyoming and four non niobrara formation dry holes in washington county  colorado 
during the six months ended december   four dry holes were drilled including two in washington county  colorado  one in utah  and one in orange county  california 
during the six months ended december   a dry hole was drilled on a prospect located in orange county  california 
based on drilling results and evaluation of the prospect  we determined that we would not pursue development and accordingly  an impairment of million was recorded for the full impairment of the remaining leasehold costs related to the prospect 
drilling and trucking operations 
we had drilling and trucking operations of million during the six months ended december  compared to million during the six months ended december  the significant increase in expenses was due to an increase in the number of rigs in operation  eight rigs as of december  compared to two rigs at december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the six months ended december  as compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to million of stock option compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  million increase in professional fees attributed largely to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  a increase in technical and administrative staff and related personnel costs  the expansion of our office facility and  of vested restricted stock and option awards granted to officers  directors and management 
gain on sale of marketable security 
during the six months ended december   the company sold investment securities classified as available for sale securities resulting in a realized gain of million 
losses on ineffective derivative instruments  net 
during the six months ended december   our gas derivative contracts became ineffective and no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness results from different changes in the nymex contract terms and the physical location  grade and quality of our oil and gas production 
the change in fair value of our gas contracts in the six month period are reflected in earnings  as opposed to being recorded in other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
as a result  we recognized a million loss in our statement of operations 
as commodity prices fluctuate  we will record our gas derivative contracts at market value with any changes in market value recorded through unrealized gain loss on derivative contracts in our statement of operations 
our oil derivative contracts continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the minority investors percentage of their share of income or losses from big dog  shark or dhs in which they hold an interest 
during the six months ended december   big dog and shark incurred operating losses 
during the six months ended december   dhs generated an operating profit 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the six months ended december   as compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase is primarily related to interest on the million senior notes that were issued in march  the increase in the average amount outstanding under our credit facility  primarily as a result of the manti acquisition completed in january  and our increased investment in the columbia river basin prospect in washington completed in april in addition  borrowings of million by dhs in also resulted in increased interest expense 
income tax benefit 
prior to june   the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets and accordingly  during the six months ended december   no income tax provision was recorded 
during the six months ended december   an income tax benefit of million was recorded for continuing operations at an effective tax rate of 
discontinued operations 
on september   we completed the sale of our deerlick creek field in tuscaloosa county  alabama for million with an effective date of july  we recorded a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of million on net proceeds of million after normal closing adjustments 
income from discontinued operations of properties sold has been restated to include the deerlick field sold in september  frisco field sold in june  east texas properties and pennsylvania properties acquired in the castle acquisition which were sold in august  the company s kansas field sold in january  the australia field and the new mexico and east texas properties  which were sold in march  the north dakota properties sold in september  the washington county  colorado properties sold in october  and the midway loop  texas properties held for sale at december  the results of operations on these assets during the six months ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to access cash 
in february  we significantly improved our liquidity position with million in gross proceeds from the sale of million shares to tracinda corporation 
as of december   our corporate rating and senior unsecured debt rating were caa and caa  respectively  as issued by moody s investors service 
moody s outlook is stable 
as of december   our corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings were b and ccc  respectively  as issued by standard and poor s s p 
s p s outlook on the rating was stable 
subsequent to year end  s p placed the ratings on creditwatch with positive implications following the announced investment by tracinda corporation 
we have completed several equity  debt  and property transactions in the past year as described below 
on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
during the year ended december   we sold non core properties in kansas  texas  new mexico  australia  and north dakota for combined net proceeds of million 
on april   we issued  shares of common stock at per share and issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due for total net proceeds of million after underwriters discounts and commissions of million 
our cash requirements are largely dependent upon the number and timing of projects included in our capital development plan  most of which are discretionary 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit  through cash provided by operating activities  sales of oil and gas properties  and through borrowings under our credit facility 
during the year ended december   we had an operating loss of million  but generated cash from operating activities of million and obtained cash from financing activities of million 
during this period we spent million on oil and gas development or million  net of million proceeds from dispositions  million on oil and gas acquisitions  and million on drilling and trucking capital expenditures or million  net of million proceeds from dispositions 
at december   we had million in cash  total assets of billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
long term debt at december  totaled million  comprised of million of bank debt  million of senior subordinated notes and million of senior convertible notes 
in april and again in february  our credit facility was paid down in full with proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility at december  was approximately million with a balance outstanding of million 
in december  dhs closed a new million credit facility with lehman brothers commercial paper  as administrative agent 
dhs has no additional availability under its credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with our quarterly financial covenants 
our covenants require a minimum current ratio of to  net of derivative instruments  and a consolidated debt to ebitdax earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and exploration of less than to for the quarter ended december   and to for the end of each quarter thereafter 
these financial covenant calculations only reflect wholly owned subsidiaries 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have a significant impact on our operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production and the success of our exploration and production activities in generating additions to production 
although we believe that through cash on hand  availability on our credit facility  and cash flows from operations  we have access to adequate capital to fund our development plans  we continue to examine additional sources of long term capital  including a restructured debt facility  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of preferred and common stock  the sales of non strategic assets  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy  will depend upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
company acquisitions and growth we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities 
during the year ended december   we completed the following transactions on october   we completed an asset exchange transaction to acquire an additional working interest in the garden gulch field in the piceance basin  in exchange for our assets in washington county  colorado and million in cash 
on june   we acquired a non controlling ownership interest in delta oilfield tank company  llc delta oilfield for cash consideration of million 
delta oilfield will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is an unconsolidated affiliate of the company 
on june   we issued  shares of common stock valued at approximately million for additional interest in a well owned and operated by the company  and additional interest in a non operated well 
on march   we issued  shares of common stock valued at approximately million for additional interests in two wells already owned and operated by us located in polk county  texas 
on march   dhs purchased a drilling rig rig for million 
the rig is an horsepower rig with a depth rating of  feet 
the rig is currently operating in the rocky mountain region 
on march   we paid million for  net acres and interests in several wells in fremont county  wyoming 
historical cash flow our cash flow from operating activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of changes in working capital 
our net cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year earlier period  primarily due to our increased drilling activity 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
cash provided by financing activities was higher in primarily due to cash received in april from our convertible debt and equity offerings 
our cash flow from operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
our net cash used in investing activities decreased by to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period a year earlier 
the decrease in cash used for investing activity can be attributed to a reduction in property acquisitions due to an increased focus on drilling activities 
cash flow from financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period the prior year 
during the year ended december   we financed our operations  acquisitions  and capital expenditures primarily with net proceeds of million in newly issued equity and million in net debt additions 
capital and exploration expenditures and financing our capital and exploration expenditures and sources of financing for the years ended december  and  six months ended december  and year ended june  were as follows six months year years ended ended ended december  december  june  in thousands capital and exploration expenditures acquisitions garden gulch austin chalk incremental interests wyoming yates washington county  south and north tongue armstrong acquisition castle savant acquisition manti columbia river basin sacramento basin karnes county  texas other other development costs drilling and trucking companies exploration costs financing sources cash flow provided by operating activities stock issued for cash upon exercised options stock issued for cash  net net long term borrowings proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties proceeds from sale of drilling assets investments in and notes issued to affiliates minority interest contributions other we anticipate our drilling expenditures to range between and million for the year ending december  based on expected cash flow from operations and anticipated other property or equity transactions during the course of the timing of a portion of our capital expenditures is discretionary and could be delayed or curtailed  if necessary 
sale of oil and gas properties discontinued operations on october   we divested our washington county  colorado assets in conjunction with an asset exchange transaction to acquire additional working interest in the garden gulch field in the piceance basin 
on september   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in north dakota for cash consideration of approximately million 
the sale resulted in a gain of million 
on march   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in new mexico and east texas for cash consideration of approximately million  prior to customary purchase price adjustments 
the sale resulted in a loss of approximately million 
on march   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in australia for cash consideration of approximately million 
the sale resulted in an after tax gain of million 
on january   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in padgett field  kansas for cash consideration of million 
the transaction resulted in a gain on sale of properties of  in march  we sold approximately of pgr for million 
this transaction involved both proved and unproved property interests and accordingly  to the extent the sale of pgr related to unproved properties  no gain could be recognized as all of the unproved cost basis was not yet recovered 
we recorded a gain of million  million net of tax  and a million reduction to property during the first quarter of as a result of the transaction 
we have retained a interest in pgr 
during december  we transferred our ownership in approximately  gross acres  net acres of non operated interests in the columbia river basin to a newly created wholly owned subsidiary  crbp 
in january and march  we sold a combined minority interest in crbp for total proceeds of million 
as the sale involved unproved properties  no gain on the partial sale of crbp could be recognized until all of the cost basis of crbp had been recovered 
accordingly  we recorded a million gain  million net of tax and an million reduction to property during the first quarter of as a result of closing the transaction 
also included in discontinued operations are our midway loop  texas oil and gas properties which are held for sale as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual and long term debt obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations at december  year years years years total in thousands senior unsecured notes interest on senior unsecured notes senior convertible notes credit facility term loan dhs derivative liability abandonment retirement obligation operating leases drilling commitments other debt obligations total contractual cash obligations senior unsecured notes  due on march   we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate amount of million which pay interest semi annually on april and october and mature in the net proceeds were used to refinance debt outstanding under our credit facility which included the amount required to acquire the manti properties located in the gulf coast region 
the notes were issued at of par and the associated discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains various restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  make certain investments  sell assets  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries 
these covenants may limit management s discretion in operating our business 
senior convertible notes  due on april   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the notes for net proceeds of million after underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  on may and november of each year  beginning november  the notes will mature on may  unless earlier converted  redeemed or repurchased 
the notes will be convertible at the holder s option  in whole or in part  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes  subject to prior repurchase of the notes 
the conversion rate may be adjusted from time to time in certain instances 
upon conversion of a note  we will have the option to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock for the notes surrendered 
in addition  following certain fundamental changes that occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such fundamental changes by a number of additional shares of common stock 
although the notes do not contain any financial covenants  the notes contain covenants that require us to properly make payments of principal and interest  provide certain reports  certificates and notices to the trustee under various circumstances  cause our wholly owned subsidiaries to become guarantors of the debt  maintain an office or agency where the notes may be presented or surrendered for payment  continue our corporate existence  pay taxes and other claims  and not seek protection from the debt under any applicable usury laws 
credit facility at december   the million credit facility had million outstanding 
on february   the credit facility was fully paid down with a portion of the proceeds from our equity offering 
the facility has variable interest rates based upon the ratio of outstanding debt to the borrowing base 
rates vary between prime 
and for base rate loans and between libor and for eurodollar loans 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants which include a current ratio of to  net of derivative instruments  and a consolidated debt to ebitdax earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and exploration ratio of less than to for the quarter ended december   and to for the end of each quarter thereafter 
the financial covenants only include subsidiaries which we own 
at december   we were in compliance with our quarterly debt covenants and restrictions 
the borrowing base is re determined by the lending banks at least semi annually on april and october of each year  or by special re determinations if requested by the company based on drilling success 
if  as a result of any reduction in the amount of our borrowing base  the total amount of the outstanding debt were to exceed the amount of the borrowing base in effect  then  within days after we are notified of the borrowing base deficiency  we would be required to make a mandatory payment of principal to reduce our outstanding indebtedness so that it would not exceed our borrowing base  to eliminate the deficiency by making three equal monthly principal payments  within days  to provide additional collateral for consideration to eliminate the deficiency or to eliminate the deficiency through a combination of through 
if for any reason we were unable to pay the full amount of the mandatory prepayment within the requisite day period  we would be in default of our obligations under our credit facility 
there was no change to our borrowing base as a result of the october re determination 
the credit facility includes terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers and acquisitions  and includes financial covenants 
under certain conditions  amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated 
bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to us or certain of our subsidiaries will result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility 
subject to notice and cure periods in certain cases  other events of default under the credit facility will result in acceleration of the indebtedness at the option of the lending banks 
such other events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of obligations under the credit facility including financial covenants  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  and a failure of the liens securing the credit facility 
this facility is secured by a first and prior lien to the lending banks on most of our oil and gas properties  certain related equipment  oil and gas inventory  and certain bank accounts and proceeds 
unsecured term loan in december we entered into an agreement with jp morgan chase bank na for a million unsecured term loan with interest at libor plus a margin of at december  the note was paid in full in january with the proceeds from the million equity offering 
credit facility dhs on december   dhs entered into a new million credit agreement with lehman commercial paper inc the proceeds were used to pay off the jp morgan credit facility 
the credit facility has a variable interest rate based on day libor plus a fixed margin of and matures on december  annual principal payments are based upon a calculation of excess cash flow as defined for the preceding year 
dhs is required to meet certain financial covenants quarterly beginning march  including i consolidated ebitda for four consecutive fiscal quarters must be greater than million  ii consolidated leverage ratio as defined for four consecutive fiscal quarters cannot exceed to  iii consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined for four consecutive fiscal quarters must exceed to and iv the current ratio for any fiscal quarter must be greater than to dhs incurred million of financing charges in conjunction with the agreement which will be amortized over the life of the loan

term loan dhs on may   dhs used proceeds from the jp morgan credit facility to pay off the remaining balance of the previously outstanding term loan of approximately million 
other contractual obligations our asset retirement obligation arises from the costs necessary to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells 
the majority of this obligation will not occur during the next five years 
we lease our corporate office in denver  colorado under an operating lease which will expire in our average yearly payments approximate million over the life of the lease 
we have additional operating lease commitments which represent office equipment leases and short term debt obligations primarily relating to field vehicles and equipment 
in march  we executed an earn in agreement with encana whereby we can earn up to  net acres in the piceance basin with the drilling of wells during the next months 
we are committed to drill total wells  eight of which were drilled by october  the remaining wells are required to be drilled by june  we are liable for  per undrilled well in the event the drilling obligations are not met 
derivative instruments represent the net estimated unrealized losses for our oil and gas hedges at december  the ultimate settlement amounts of these hedges are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas reserves  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
successful efforts method of accounting we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within an oil and gas field are typically considered development costs and are capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved  and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of gas and oil properties we review our oil and gas properties for impairment quarterly or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our developed proved properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the proved properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures and production costs  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
for developed properties  the review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the asset with the asset s expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
as a result of such assessment during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties 
the company recorded no impairment provision attributable to developed properties for the six months ended december  and the year ended june  for fiscal year  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain proved and unproved properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future quarters our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities we may periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts or fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize futures contracts  swaps or options  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
effective july   we elected to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively 
beginning july   we recognize mark to market gains and losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income 
asset retirement obligation we account for our asset retirement obligations under sfas sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for retirement obligations of acquired assets 
the company s asset retirement obligations arise from the plugging and abandonment liabilities for its oil and gas wells 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  an interpretation of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as it is used in sfas the company applied the guidance of fin beginning july   resulting in no impact on its financial statements 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we follow sfas to account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
as a result of management s current assessment  we maintain a significant valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in our reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  we may determine that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be increased or decreased 
such changes would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense or benefit 
recently issued accounting standards and pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any resulting goodwill  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or our fiscal year  and must be applied prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
we will evaluate how the new requirements could impact the accounting for any acquisitions completed beginning in fiscal and beyond  and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests minority interests in subsidiaries 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or our fiscal year  and must be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   or fiscal year we have not yet determined if we will elect to apply any of the provisions of sfas or what effect the adoption of the statement would have  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
upon the adoption of fin  we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
during the year ended december   no adjustments were recognized for uncertain tax benefits 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax benefit expense 
no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were accrued at december  the tax years through for federal returns and through for state returns remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  although no material changes to unrecognized tax positions are expected within the next twelve months 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific  but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability 
sfas upholds the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures 
this statement is effective for fiscal year commencing january  we do not expect the impact of sfas to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we anticipate the primary impact of the standard will be additional disclosures related to the measurement of fair value in the company s recurring impairment test calculations related to oil and gas properties  drilling rigs  and goodwill  the valuation of oil and gas derivative financial instruments  and the valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in future business combinations  if any 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate and price risk we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  including costless collars  swaps  and puts 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
we use hedges to limit the risk of fluctuating cash flows that fund our capital expenditure program 
we also may use hedges in conjunction with acquisitions to achieve expected economic returns during the payout period 
the net fair value of our derivative instruments was a million liability at december  and a million liability on february  as of february   our derivative contracts cover approximately bcfe of our production 
assuming production and the percent of oil and gas sold remained unchanged from the year ended december   a hypothetical decline in the average market price the company realized during the year ended december  on unhedged production would reduce the company s oil and natural gas revenues by approximately million on an annual basis 
interest rate risk we were subject to interest rate risk on million of variable rate debt obligations at december  the annual effect of a change in interest rates would be approximately million 
the interest rate on these variable debt obligations approximates current market rates as of december
