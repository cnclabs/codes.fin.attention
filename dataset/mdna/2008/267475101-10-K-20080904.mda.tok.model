item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto  as well as the business and risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground facility locating services to various utilities including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others 
additionally  we provide services on a limited basis in canada 
for the fiscal year ended july   revenue by type from telecommunications  underground facility locating  and electric utilities and other customers  was approximately   and  respectively 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  as well as changes in the general level of construction activity 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecommunication providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are covered by master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods greater than one year 
we are currently a party to approximately of these arrangements 
master service agreements generally are for contract periods of one or more years and contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete unit pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability of the customer to issue to others work orders valued above a specified dollar limit  the self performance of the work by the customer s in house workforce  and the ability to use others when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for specific projects are generally three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld by the customer pending project completion 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 

table of contents the following table summarizes our revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  as a percentage of contract revenues from continuing operations fiscal year end july  july  july  multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage of revenue from long term contracts varies based on the mix of work performed during each period 
fiscal included revenue for services pursuant to short term contracts related to the hurricanes that impacted the southeastern united states 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers contributing at least of our total revenue from continuing operations in any of fiscal   or fiscal year ended july  july  july  at t verizon comcast time warner cable embarq charter qwest windstream questar gas for comparison purposes  bellsouth and at t revenues have been combined for periods prior to their december merger 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including amounts for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation and amortization  and insurance claims and related costs 
in addition  cost of earned revenue includes amounts related to the settlement of the legal matter described below related to our utiliquest  llc  sts  llc and locating  inc subsidiaries 
for a majority of the contract services we perform  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance services 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains the financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
general and administrative costs include all of our costs at the corporate level  as well as costs of our subsidiaries management personnel and administrative overhead 
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  legal and professional fees  provision or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to the provision of services under customer contracts 
our senior management  including the senior managers of our subsidiaries  perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 

table of contents during fiscal  we were was contacted by counsel representing current and former employees alleging violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws at our utiliquest  llc  sts  llc and locating  inc subsidiaries 
the claims included periods dating primarily from september through january  and covered a number of states where these subsidiaries conducted business 
during the second quarter of fiscal  these subsidiaries reached an agreement to settle these claims through a structured mediation process 
while the subsidiaries deny the allegations underlying the dispute  they have agreed to the mediated settlement to avoid additional legal fees  the uncertainty of a jury trial and the management time and effort that would have been devoted to litigation 
the time period for plaintiffs to opt in to the class lapsed in july excluding legal expenses  we incurred approximately million related to the settlement of this matter in costs of earned revenues during fiscal in december  two former employees of apex digital  llc apex  a wholly owned subsidiary that was discontinued during the second quarter of fiscal  commenced a lawsuit against the subsidiary in illinois state court 
the lawsuit alleged that apex violated certain minimum wage laws under the fair labor standards act and related state laws by failing to comply with applicable minimum wage and overtime pay requirements 
the plaintiffs sought damages and costs 
they also sought to certify  and eventually notify  a class consisting of former employees who  since december  have worked for apex 
on january  the case was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois 
in july  plaintiffs amended the complaint to include dycom as a defendant 
in june  the defendants reached an agreement to settle these claims through a structured mediation process 
while apex denies allegations underlying the dispute  it agreed to the mediated settlement to avoid additional legal fees  the uncertainty of a jury trial and the management time and effort that would have been devoted to litigation 
the settlement is subject to court approval 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  apex incurred a charge of approximately million which represents management s best estimate of the amount to be paid pursuant to the settlement 
actual payments could differ from our estimate 
from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries are also party to various other claims and legal proceedings 
additionally  as part of our insurance program  we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
for these claims  the effect of our financial statements is generally limited to the amount of our insurance deductible or insurance retention 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that none of such other pending claims or proceedings will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify acquisition opportunities and successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
in september  we acquired the outstanding common stock of cable express holding company cable express for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees  and assumed million in capital lease obligations 
during december  we acquired the outstanding common stock of prince telecom holdings  inc prince for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees 
cable express and prince provide specialty contracting services for leading cable multiple system operators 
these services include the installation and maintenance of customer premise equipment  including set top boxes and cable modems 
in january  we acquired certain assets of a cable television operator for approximately million 
in march  we acquired certain assets of cavo communications  inc cavo for million and assumed million in capital lease obligations and certain other liabilities 
cavo provides specialty contracting services for leading cable multiple system operators 
neither of these two acquisitions was material to our revenue  results of operations or financial position 

table of contents discontinued operations during fiscal  apex  a wholly owned subsidiary  notified its primary customer of its intention to cease performing installation services in accordance with its contractual rights 
effective december  this customer  a satellite broadcast provider  transitioned its installation service requirements to others and apex ceased providing these services 
as a result  we have discontinued the operations of apex and presented its results separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
we do not expect the cessation of these installation services to have any material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see the discussion under overview above regarding current legal proceedings at apex 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to governmental deregulation  advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable industries converge  and growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability 
telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
these factors drive the needs of customers for the services we provide 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in home wiring 
additionally  fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
during and  several large telephone companies announced fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives as a means to begin to compete actively with cable operators 
these initiatives have continued through fiscal and are expected to continue through fiscal  resulting in demand for the type of services we provide 
in addition  our cable customers are expected to spend capital to deliver further high definition video capabilities and to deploy customer premise equipment to facilitate the transition to digital television during we also provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
underground excavation is involved in a substantial portion of overall economic activity  including the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
utility line locating is required prior to underground excavation 
the trend for outsourcing this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity  primarily influences the demand for utility line locating services 
we believe that our customers spending will continue to be impacted by us economic conditions  including the downturn in the housing market 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our results were impacted by a decline in customer spending which occurred in january 
this decline was the result of a noticeable softening in the intensity with which a broad range of customers executed near term spending plans 
it was evident in the delayed approval of calendar budgets by certain customers  the pace with which approved budgets were executed during january  overall volumes of available work  and in certain instances  customer specific delays 
due to the pace of january s revenue decline in relation to our scheduled workforce level  gross margin was negatively affected 
these conditions generally improved during the second half of fiscal however  we believe a slow growth environment will continue into fiscal additionally  generally higher fuel costs are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results during fiscal we continue to manage the areas of the business that we can control 
these areas include  but are not limited to  deploying appropriate workforce levels and supervisory employees  practicing sound safety procedures  managing 
table of contents fuel consumption levels and maintaining the investment in our fleet of vehicles and equipment to support current and future business opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued insurance claims  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  and accounting for performance based stock awards  income taxes and contingencies  including legal matters 
application of these estimates and assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
accrued insurance claims 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims 
as of july   the liability for accrued claims and related accrued processing costs was million compared to million at july  based on past experience  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  
table of contents to be paid within the next months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they will not be paid until some time in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the increase in accrued insurance claims at july  was primarily due to increased operating levels and the timing of claims payments 
the following table summarizes our primary insurance coverage and annual retention amounts as of july  which are applicable in all of the states in which we operate  except with respect to workers compensation insurance in three states in which we participate in a state fund dollars in thousands loss retention per occurrence workers compensation liability claims automobile liability claims  a general liability claims  except utiliquest  llc a general liability claims for utiliquest  llc  a employee health plan claims per participant per annum stop loss and umbrella coverage a aggregate stop loss coverage for workers compensation  automobile and general liability claims  b umbrella liability coverage for automobile  general liability  and employer s liability claims a we retain the risk of loss for automobile liability and general liability between million and million on a per occurrence basis in excess of the retention amount stated in the table  subject to an aggregate stop loss of million for this layer 
b aggregate stop loss coverage for workers compensation automobile and general liability claims was  for fiscal the estimate for accrued insurance claims is subject to uncertainty 
if actual results significantly differ from estimates used to calculate the liability  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially impacted 
goodwill and intangible assets as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
during fiscal goodwill was reduced by approximately million for the impairment charge described below 
goodwill also decreased by approximately million as a result of the receipt of escrowed funds for indemnification of claims related to the cable express acquisition and by approximately million related to the application of financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
our reporting units and related indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of the reporting unit s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable intangible asset is less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
in order to measure fair value  we employ a combination of present value techniques which reflect market factors 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value and could result in an impairment 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors which reflect the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues within a limited number of customers and the level of overall economic activity 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
specifically during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline during periods of economic downturns which could adversely affect our operations  cash flows and liquidity 
as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our stevens communications stevens reporting unit and nichols construction nichols reporting unit were impaired and consequently recognized goodwill impairment charges of approximately and million  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from customers of stevens and nichols 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  each of these reporting units has a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers 
changes in anticipated demand had an adverse impact on the expected future cash flows of the reporting units used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduction in demand is the result of the customers decisions regarding the allocation of their capital spending away from work management anticipated would be performed by these reporting units 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the expected cash flows over the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
stevens and nichols have remaining goodwill of and million  respectively  subsequent to the impairment 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  the results of the stevens and nichols reporting units have not been material to our consolidated results 
this change in anticipated demand levels did not have an adverse impact on our other subsidiaries 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our can am communications can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it had underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and operational inefficiencies at the level of work performed 
management determined that these factors increased the uncertainty surrounding future levels of revenue expected from can am 
we changed the senior management at can am during the later part of fiscal  integrating certain of its operations with another subsidiary  in order to improve operational efficiency 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit and are circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of april  as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  consequently  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 

table of contents the estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal and annual impairment test were a expected cash flow for periods of seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate during the period of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal impairment tests  including the can am impairment test  were a expected cash flow periods of seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate during the period of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
management believes the rates used are consistent with the risks inherent in our business model and with industry discount rates 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
a change in the discount rate used would have had an impact on the amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded 
for example  a change in the discount rate would have caused an increase or decrease in our goodwill impairment charge in fiscal by approximately million 
during our fiscal goodwill impairment test  the estimated fair value of our utiliquest reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 
the goodwill balances of this reporting unit may have an increased likelihood of impairment if a sustained downturn in customer demand were to occur  or if the reporting unit were not able to execute against customer opportunities  and the long term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted 
furthermore  changes in the long term outlook may result in changes to other valuation assumptions 
the utiliquest reporting unit  with a goodwill balance of million  provides services to a broad range of customers including utilities and telecommunication providers in over states throughout the united states 
these services are required prior to underground excavation and are influenced by overall economic activity  including construction activity 
demand for these services could decline during periods of economic downturn which could adversely affect the operations and cashflows of the reporting unit 
additionally  the utiliquest reporting unit was impacted by a charge for the litigation described under overview above during fiscal and by increased professional fees related to this matter 
as of july   we believe the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset is recoverable for all of the reporting units  however  there can be no assurances that they will not be impaired in future periods 
certain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets including tradenames and customer relationship intangibles 
as of july   management believes that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets are recoverable 
however  if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets may become impaired 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which amended sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires that share based awards granted to employees be fair valued on the date of grant  with limited exceptions  and the related expense recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
sfas no 
r became effective for us on july   the first day of fiscal prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
which required recognition of compensation expense using the intrinsic value method  whereby compensation expense was determined as the excess of the market value of the underlying stock over the exercise price of the option at the measurement date 
beginning july   we applied the modified prospective application of sfas no 
r to all of our stock based awards 
additionally  beginning in fiscal we shifted from granting stock options to our employees and officers to granting time based and performance based restricted shares and restricted share units see note  stock based awards in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for performance based awards  in accordance with sfas no 
r  compensation cost must be recognized over the requisite service period if it is 
table of contents probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine whether it is probable the performance goals will be satisfied at each reporting period and record compensation costs accordingly  however  the recognition or non recognition of such compensation cost remains subject to uncertainty 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
in june  the fasb issued fin which prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
this fsp amends fin to provide guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to ultimately settled through examination  negotiation  or litigation 
we adopted the provisions of fin on july   the first day of fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the adoption of the interpretation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances on a regular basis 
this analysis considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that none of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with sfas no 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of revenues earned  our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated totals may not add due to rounding fiscal year ended july  july  july  dollars in millions revenues expenses cost of earned revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization general and administrative depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment charge total interest income interest expense other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenues

table of contents during fiscal and  telecommunications customer revenue included million and million  respectively  from services performed by companies we acquired during fiscal the following table presents revenue by type of customer excluding the amounts attributed to companies and businesses acquired during fiscal fiscal year ended july  july  increase increase dollars in millions telecommunications underground facility locating electric utilities and other customers revenues from business acquired in fiscal total contract revenues information not meaningful excluding revenue from businesses acquired during fiscal  revenues from specialty construction services provided to telecommunications customers were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
this increase resulted from additional revenue from certain significant customers including million for installation  maintenance and construction services provided to three cable multiple system operators  million in additional revenue from a customer engaged in a multi year fiber deployment project and million related to two telephone customers maintaining and upgrading their networks 
other customers contributed net increases in revenue of million during fiscal offsetting these increases  were decreases in revenue of million from two significant telephone customers 
total revenues from underground facility locating for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was primarily the result of additional work for a telephone customer related to a contract that began during the third quarter of fiscal our total revenues from electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to the fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to additional construction work performed for a gas customer 
costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to  million during fiscal from million during fiscal the primary components of this increase were direct labor and subcontractor costs taken together which increased million and other direct costs which increased million 
these increases were primarily due to higher levels of operations during fiscal  including the operation of cable express since its acquisition in september  and million incurred to settle certain legal matters relating to our utiliquest  llc  sts  llc and locating  inc subsidiaries described under overview above 
the cost of direct materials was relatively unchanged between fiscal and during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  costs of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenues increased 
of the total increase  was in labor and labor related costs  of which was from costs directly related to settlement of the legal matter described above 
other increases in labor and labor related costs as a percentage of contract revenues were primarily a result of the impact of our cost structure in relation to the lower than anticipated revenues during the latter part of the second quarter of fiscal the lower revenues were the result of reduced customer spending during the second quarter  a condition that generally improved during the second half of fiscal we also experienced an increase in other direct costs of primarily due to higher fuel costs which increased as a percentage of contract revenues compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting the increased fuel costs were reductions in costs for equipment and insurance claims and the reduction of a pre acquisition liability associated with payroll related accruals of an acquired subsidiary in the amount of million 
as a percentage of contract revenues  there was a decrease of during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a reduction in those projects where we provide materials to the customer 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased payroll expenses as a result of the growth of our operations  the incremental costs of cable express which was acquired in september and increased legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased payroll costs and increased legal expenses 
these increases were partially offset by reduced performance cash awards and performance based stock awards as a result of lower operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal stock based compensation expense during fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to compared to from fiscal year the dollar amount and percentage increase for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of increased capital expenditures during fiscal and fiscal to support the growth and replacement of our fleet of assets 
additionally  overall depreciation and amortization increased with the addition of fixed assets and intangible assets related to the acquisition of cable express in september and cavo in march goodwill impairment charge 
during fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in total related to our nichols construction reporting unit and our stevens communications reporting unit as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis 
as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our stevens reporting unit and nichols reporting unit were impaired and consequently recognized goodwill impairment charges of approximately and million  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows for customers of stevens and nichols 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  each of these reporting units has a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers 
changes in anticipated demand had an adverse impact on the expected future cash flows of the reporting units used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduction in demand is the result of the customers decisions regarding the allocation of their capital spending away from work management anticipated would be performed by these reporting units 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the expected cash flows over the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
stevens and nichols have remaining goodwill of and million  respectively  subsequent to the impairment 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  the results of the nichols and stevens reporting units have not been material to our consolidated results 
this change in anticipated demand levels did not have an adverse impact on our other subsidiaries

costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary components of this increase were direct labor and subcontractor costs taken together  other direct costs  and direct materials  which increased million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to higher levels of operations during fiscal  including the operations of cable express and prince since their acquisitions in september and december  respectively 
as a percentage of contract revenues  costs of earned revenues decreased for fiscal  as compared to the same period last year 
labor and labor related costs decreased as a percent of contract revenues primarily as a result of less subcontracted labor in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline was due to less subcontracted labor as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the prince and cable express acquisitions 
decreases in other direct costs contributed of the total percent decrease primarily due to reduced vehicle rental  travel and other direct costs compared to higher amounts incurred during fiscal in connection with the hurricane restoration services and decreases in insurance costs as a result of reduced loss development activity for insured claims during fiscal these 
table of contents reductions were partially offset by increases in group health insurance costs and higher fuel costs

goodwill impairment charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it had underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and due to operational inefficiencies at the level of work performed 
management determined that these factors increased the uncertainty surrounding future levels of revenue expected from can am 
we changed the senior management at can am during the later part of fiscal  integrating certain of its operations with another of our subsidiaries in order to improve operational efficiency 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit and were circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of april  as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  as a result  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of lower cash balances as compared to fiscal due to the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions of cable express  cavo  and prince  and due to higher amounts of capital expenditures in fiscal interest expense

sufficiency of capital resources 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash balances and amounts available under our credit agreement  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations  including required interest payments on our notes and borrowings and to support our normal replacement of equipment at our current level of business for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  our capital requirements may increase 
backlog 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts  including master service agreements 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
our backlog totaled billion and billion at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during fiscal seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decreases around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuations in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuation in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on social security withholdings and unemployment obligations  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  
table of contents fluctuations in stock based compensation expense as a result of performance criteria in performance based share awards  as well as the timing and vesting period of all stock based awards fluctuations in performance cash awards as a result of operating results fluctuations in other income as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period  and fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and our debt obligations 
the effects of market changes on interest rates are monitored and we manage the interest rate risk by investing in short term investments with market rates of interest and by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in a change to annual interest income by approximately million based on the amount of cash and equivalents held as of july  as of july   outstanding long term debt included our million notes due in  which bear a fixed rate of interest of 
due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on the related interest expense 
the fair value of the notes totaled approximately million as of july  based on quoted market prices 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes with respect to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect at july  would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
as of july   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement 
our credit agreement generally permits borrowings at a variable rate of interest 
as of july   we had million of capital leases with varying rates of interest due through fiscal a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates in effect at july  on these capital leases would not have a material impact on the fair value of the leases or on our annual interest cost 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
