item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  vehicle demand  and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts  is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk in the uk  vehicles sold after march and september of each year reflect a later date of sale  decreasing their perceived residual value

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks relating to automotive manufacturers automotive manufacturers exercise significant control over our operations and we depend on them in order to operate our business 
each of our dealerships operates under franchise agreements with automotive manufacturers or related distributors 
we are dependent on automotive manufacturers because  without a franchise agreement  we cannot operate a new vehicle franchise or perform manufacturer authorized service 
manufacturers exercise a great degree of control over the operations of our dealerships 
for example  manufacturers can require our dealerships to meet specified standards of appearance  require individual dealerships to meet specified financial criteria such as maintenance of minimum net working capital and  in some cases  minimum net worth  impose minimum customer service and satisfaction standards  set standards regarding the maintenance of vehicle and parts inventories  restrict the use of manufacturers names and trademarks and  in many cases  must consent to the replacement of the dealership principal 
our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by automotive manufacturers for a variety of reasons  including unapproved changes of ownership or management and other material breaches of the franchise agreements 
we have  from time to time  not been compliant with various provisions of some of our franchise agreements 
our operations in the uk operate without local franchise law protection see above regulation  and we are aware of efforts by certain manufacturers not to renew their franchise agreements with certain other retailers in the uk although we believe that we will be able to renew at expiration all of our existing franchise agreements  if any of our significant existing franchise agreements or a large number of franchise agreements are not renewed or the terms of any such renewal are materially unfavorable to us  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  actions taken by manufacturers to exploit their bargaining position in negotiating the terms of renewals of franchise agreements or otherwise could also materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
while us franchise laws give us limited protection in selling a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area  our franchise agreements do not give us the exclusive right to sell vehicles within a given area 
in  the european commission approved changes to its regulatory landscape by limiting automotive manufacturers block exemption to certain anti competitive rules in regards to establishing and maintaining a retail network 
the principal changes were designed to allow existing manufacturer authorized retailers to relocate or add additional facilities throughout the european union  offer multiple brands in the same facility  allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on transfers of dealerships between existing franchisees within the european union 
while we continue to monitor the actual effects of these rule changes for our dealerships in european union including the uk  these rules could increase competition by facilitating the opening of additional dealerships near our dealerships 
if a significant number of new dealerships are opened near our existing dealerships  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially affected 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles  which tends to produce the highest profit margins 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership 
our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular models  whether due to sales declines at our dealerships or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our volumes and profitability may be adversely affected if automotive manufacturers reduce or discontinue their incentive programs 
our dealerships depend on the manufacturers for sales incentives  warranties and other programs that promote and support vehicle sales at our dealerships 
some of these programs include customer rebates  dealer incentives  special financing or leasing terms and warranties 
manufacturers frequently change their incentive programs 
if manufacturers reduce or discontinue incentive programs  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
our success depends on the overall success of the line of vehicles that each of our dealerships sells 
as a result  our success depends to a great extent on the automotive manufacturers financial condition  marketing  vehicle design  production and distribution capabilities  reputation  management and labor relations 
for  bmw mini  toyota lexus brands  honda acura and daimler brands accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
a significant decline in the sale of new vehicles manufactured by these manufacturers  or the loss or deterioration of our relationships with one or more of these manufacturers  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
no other manufacturer accounted for more than of our total revenues for events such as labor strikes that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also materially adversely affect us  especially if these events were to interrupt the supply of vehicles or parts to us 
similarly  the delivery of vehicles from manufacturers at a time later than scheduled  which may occur particularly during periods of new product introductions  has led  and in the future could lead  to reduced sales during those periods 
in addition  any event that causes adverse publicity involving one or more automotive manufacturers or their vehicles may materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our failure to meet manufacturers consumer satisfaction requirements may adversely affect us 
many manufacturers measure customers satisfaction with their sales and warranty service experiences through systems that are generally known as customer satisfaction indices  or csi 
manufacturers sometimes use a dealership s csi scores as a factor in evaluating applications for additional dealership acquisitions 
certain of our dealerships have had difficulty from time to time in meeting their manufacturers csi standards 
we may be unable to meet these standards in the future 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to a franchise acquisition by us if our dealerships do not meet their csi standards 
this could materially adversely affect our acquisition strategy 
in addition  because we receive payments from the manufacturers based in part on csi scores  future payments could be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi scores decline 
automotive manufacturers impose limits on our ability to issue additional equity and on the ownership of our common stock by third parties  which may hamper our ability to meet our financing needs 
a number of manufacturers impose restrictions on the sale and transfer of our common stock 
the most prohibitive restrictions provide that  under specified circumstances  we may be forced to sell or surrender franchises if a competing automotive manufacturer acquires a or greater ownership interest in us or if an individual or entity that has a criminal record in connection with business dealings with any automotive manufacturer  distributor or dealer or who has been convicted of a felony acquires a or greater ownership interest in us 
further  several manufacturers have the right to approve the acquisition by a third party of or more of our common stock  and a number of manufacturers continue to prohibit changes in ownership that may affect control of our company 
actions by our stockholders or prospective stockholders that would violate any of the above restrictions are generally outside our control 
if we are unable to obtain a waiver or relief from these restrictions  we may be forced to terminate or sell one or more franchises  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
these restrictions also may prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
these restrictions also may impede our ability to raise required capital or our ability to acquire dealership groups using our common stock may also be inhibited 

table of contents risks relating to our acquisition strategy growth in our revenues and earnings depends substantially on our ability to acquire and successfully operate new dealerships 
while we expect to acquire new dealerships  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire additional dealerships in the future 
moreover  acquisitions involve a number of risks  including integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships  operating in new markets with which we are not familiar  incurring unforeseen liabilities at acquired dealerships  disruption to our existing business  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired dealerships  impairment of relationships with employees  manufacturers and customers  and incorrectly valuing acquired entities 
in addition  integrating acquired dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs  diversion of our management resources or other operational or financial problems 
unforeseen expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the integration of acquired entities and the rapid expansion of operations could inhibit our growth  result in our failure to achieve acquisition synergies and require us to focus resources on integration rather than other more profitable areas 
acquired entities may subject us to unforeseen liabilities that we did not detect prior to completing the acquisition  or liabilities that turn out to be greater than those we had expected 
these liabilities may include liabilities that arise from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners for which we  as a successor owner  will be responsible 
we may be unable to identify acquisition candidates that would result in the most successful combinations  or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
the magnitude  timing  pricing and nature of future acquisitions will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities  the availability of skilled employees to manage the acquired companies and general economic and business conditions 
further  we may need to borrow funds to complete future acquisitions  which funds may not be available 
furthermore  we have sold and may in the future sell dealerships based on numerous factors  which may impact our future revenues and earnings  particularly if we do not make acquisitions to replace such revenues and earnings 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth 
our future growth via acquisition of automotive dealerships will depend on our ability to obtain the requisite manufacturer approvals 
the relevant manufacturer must consent to any franchise acquisition and it may not consent in a timely fashion or at all 
in addition  under many franchise agreements or under local law  a manufacturer may have a right of first refusal to acquire a dealership that we seek to acquire 
certain manufacturers limit the total number of their dealerships that we may own in a particular geographic area and  in some cases  the total number of their vehicles that we may sell as a percentage of that manufacturer s overall sales 
manufacturers may also limit the ownership of stores in contiguous markets and the dueling of a franchise with another brand 
to date  we have only reached national ceilings with one manufacturer and have reached certain geographical limitations with several manufacturers 
if additional manufacturers impose or expand these types of restrictions  our acquisition strategy and results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents other business risks our business is susceptible to adverse economic conditions  including changes in consumer confidence  fuel prices and credit availability 
we believe that the automotive retail industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  interest rates  fuel prices  weather conditions  unemployment rates and credit availability 
for some finance borrowers  credit availability has recently been restricted as compared to prior years 
if credit availability generally were to be restricted  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected as many of our retail sales customers purchase vehicles using credit 
fuel prices are currently higher as compared to recent years 
if fuel prices continue to increase  vehicle demand could be adversely affected which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
historically  unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  new vehicle retail sales tend to experience periods of decline characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
the automotive retail industry may experience sustained periods of decline in vehicle sales in the future 
any decline or change of this type could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
some of our operations are regionally concentrated such as those in arizona  california  the northeastern us and the united kingdom 
adverse regional economic and competitive conditions in these areas could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
substantial competition in automotive sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retail industry is highly competitive 
depending on the geographic market  we compete with franchised automotive dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles that we offer  private market buyers and sellers of used vehicles  internet based vehicle brokers that sell vehicles obtained from franchised dealers directly to consumers  vehicle rental companies that sell their used rental vehicles  service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
in addition  we compete against automotive manufacturers in some retail markets  which may negatively affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
some of our competitors may have greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and lower overhead and sales costs than us 
we do not have any cost advantage over other franchised automotive dealerships in purchasing new vehicles from the automotive manufacturers 
in addition to competition for vehicle sales  our dealerships compete with franchised dealerships to perform warranty repairs and with other automotive dealers  independent service center chains  independent garages and others  for non warranty repair  routine maintenance and parts business 
a number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our dealerships prices 
we also compete with a broad range of financial institutions in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases 
the internet is a significant part of the sales process in our industry 
we believe that customers are using the internet to compare pricing for cars and related finance and insurance services  which may reduce gross profit margins for new and used cars and profits generated from the sale of finance and insurance products 
some websites offer vehicles for sale over the internet without the benefit of having a dealership franchise  although they must currently source their vehicles from a franchised dealer 
if internet new vehicle sales are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers  or if dealerships are able to effectively use the internet to sell outside of their markets  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we could also be materially adversely affected to the extent that internet companies acquire dealerships or ally themselves with our competitors dealerships 

table of contents our distribution of the smart fortwo is a new business for us whose profitability is unproven 
we are incurring costs to develop processes  systems and strategies to distribute the smart fortwo vehicle in the us and puerto rico 
the wholesale distribution of vehicles is new to us and involves developing and successfully implementing processes and strategies different from that currently used in our automotive retail operations 
in connection with this effort  our senior management has devoted substantial time and effort and we hired a team of employees 
during  the cost of these employees and efforts associated with developing the smart distribution business negatively impacted our earnings 
if our efforts are not successful  or we incur unforeseen costs  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment 
we finance our purchases of new and  to a lesser extent  used vehicle inventory using floor plan financing arrangements under which we are charged interest at floating rates 
in addition  we obtain capital for general corporate purposes  dealership acquisitions and real estate purchases and improvements under predominantly floating interest rate credit facilities 
therefore  excluding the potential mitigating effects from interest rate hedging techniques  our interest expenses will rise with increases in interest rates 
rising interest rates may also have the affect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicles sales  because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the affect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions and may require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million of total non floor plan debt outstanding and billion of floor plan notes payable outstanding 
in addition  we have additional debt capacity under our credit facilities 
our substantial debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future for our acquisitions and operations  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service or other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to repay debt and related interest rather than other areas of our business  limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties  making acquisitions or paying dividends  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and make us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic or industry conditions or a downturn in our business 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our future performance  which will be impacted by general economic conditions and by financial  business and other competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors could include operating difficulties  increased operating costs  the actions of competitors  regulatory developments and delays in implementing our growth strategies 
our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend on our success in implementing our business strategies 
we may not be able to implement our business strategies and the anticipated results of our strategies may not be realized 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future sufficient borrowings are not available to us  we might not be able to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to service our debt  we may have to delay or cancel acquisitions  sell equity securities  sell assets or restructure or refinance our debt 
if we are unable to service our debt  we may not be able to pursue these options on a timely basis 
table of contents or on satisfactory terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of our existing or future franchise agreements  agreements with manufacturers or debt agreements may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives 
our inability to raise capital  if needed  could adversely affect us 
we require substantial capital in order to acquire and renovate automotive dealerships 
this capital might be raised through public or private financing  including through the issuance of debt or equity securities  sale leaseback transactions and other sources 
availability under our credit agreements may be limited by the covenants and conditions of those facilities 
we may not be able to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail our acquisition and renovation programs  which could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy 
we depend to a significant extent on our ability to finance the purchase of inventory in the form of floor plan financing 
floor plan financing is financing from a vehicle manufacturer secured by the vehicles we sell 
our dealerships borrow money to buy a particular vehicle from the manufacturer and pay off the floor plan financing when they sell the particular vehicle  paying interest during the interim period 
our floor plan financing is secured by substantially all of the assets of our automotive dealership subsidiaries 
our remaining assets are pledged to secure our credit facilities 
this may impede our ability to borrow from other sources 
most of our floor plan lenders are associated with manufacturers with whom we have franchise agreements 
consequently  the deterioration of our relationship with a manufacturer could adversely affect our relationship with the affiliated floor plan lender and vice versa 
any inability to obtain floor plan financing on customary terms  or the termination of our floor plan financing arrangements by our floor plan lenders  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the potential for sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
in addition  the amount of equity securities that we issue in connection with acquisitions and renovations could be significant resulting in dilution to you or adversely affecting our stock price 
the majority of our outstanding shares are held by two shareholders  each of whom has registration rights that could result in a substantial number of shares being sold in the market 
moreover  these shares could be resold at any time subject to the volume limitations under rule in addition  we also have reserved for issuance a significant number of shares relating to our convertible senior subordinated notes which  if issued  may result in substantial dilution to you or adversely effect our stock price 
finally  we have a significant amount of authorized but unissued shares that  if issued  could materially adversely effect our stock price 
property loss  business interruptions or other liabilities at some of our dealerships could impact our operating results 
the automotive retail business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property values at dealership locations  including vehicles and parts 
we have historically experienced business interruptions at several of our dealerships due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events  such as wild fires in california or hurricanes in florida 
other potential liabilities arising out of our operations involve claims by employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
to the extent we experience future similar events  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely impacted 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management and key employees  including  in particular  roger s 
penske  our chairman and chief executive officer 
additionally  our business is dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified 
table of contents personnel  such as managers  as well as retaining dealership management in connection with acquisitions 
we generally have not entered into employment agreements with our key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team  including  in particular  roger s 
penske  could have a material adverse effect on us and materially impair the efficiency and productivity of our operations 
we do not have key man insurance for any of our executive officers or key personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees or the failure to attract qualified managers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors 
the automotive industry typically experiences seasonal variations in vehicle revenues 
demand for automobiles in the us is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us that may have severe winters 
in the us  a higher number of vehicle sales generally occur in the second and third quarters of each year  due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
in addition  the uk retail automotive industry typically experiences peak sales activity during march and september of each year 
this seasonality results from the perception in the united kingdom that the resale value of a vehicle may be determined by the date that the vehicle is registered 
because new vehicle registration periods begin on march and september each year  vehicles with comparable mileage that were registered in march may have an equivalent used vehicle value to vehicles registered in august of the same year 
therefore  if conditions exist during these periods that depress or affect automotive sales  such as high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year may be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles profitably 
a significant portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  vehicle parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the region in which they are sold 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks associated with imported merchandise  including fluctuations in the relative value of currencies  import duties  exchange controls  differing tax structures  trade restrictions  transportation costs  work stoppages and general political and economic conditions in foreign countries 
the locations in which we operate may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs on imported merchandise 
any of those impositions or adjustments could materially affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and parts at reasonable prices  which could materially adversely affect our business 
we are subject to substantial regulation  claims and legal proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our profitability 
a number of regulations affect our business of marketing  selling  financing  distributing and servicing automobiles 
under the laws of states in us locations in which we currently operate  we typically must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service  including dealer  sales  finance and insurance related licenses 
these laws also regulate our conduct of business  including our advertising  operating  financing  employment and sales practices 
in addition  our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions 
our financing activities with customers are subject to truth in lending  consumer leasing  equal credit opportunity and similar regulations as well as motor vehicle finance laws  installment finance laws  insurance laws  usury laws and other installment sales laws 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales 
in recent years  private plaintiffs and state attorneys general in the us have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
these activities have led many lenders to limit the amounts that may be charged to customers as fee income for these activities 
if these or similar activities were significantly to restrict our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers  we could be adversely affected 

table of contents we could also be susceptible to claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with applicable laws 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or any of our dealers by individuals  either individually or through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings 
such actions may expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 
we are involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business including litigation with customers regarding our products and services  and expect to continue to be subject to claims related to our existing business and any new business 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant license or permit or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and future prospects 
if state dealer laws in the us are repealed or weakened  our dealership franchise agreements will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation 
state dealer laws in the us generally provide that an automotive manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure  or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our us dealerships to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration 
jurisdictions outside the us generally do not have these laws and  as a result  operate without these protections 
our dealerships are subject to environmental regulations that may result in claims and liabilities which could be material 
we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the operation and removal of storage tanks and the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
our dealerships and service  parts and body shop operations in particular use  store and contract for recycling or disposal of hazardous materials 
any non compliance with these regulations could result in significant fines and penalties which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
further  investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks 
in the us  we may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling  treatment  and or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes  which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
similar to many of our competitors  we have incurred and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at some of our current or former properties 
in connection with our acquisitions  it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities  some of which may be material 
in connection with dispositions of businesses  or dispositions previously made by companies we acquire  we may retain exposure for environmental costs and liabilities  some of which may be material 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations  stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents our principal stockholders have substantial influence over us and may make decisions with which you disagree 
penske corporation through various affiliates beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  penske corporation and its affiliates have entered into a stockholders agreement with our second largest stockholder  mitsui co  ltd

due to their relationships with these related entities  messrs 
ishikawa  kurnick  penske  penske  jr  and peters may have a conflict of interest in making any decision related to transactions between their related entities and us  or with respect to allocations of corporate opportunities 
our operations outside the us subject us to foreign currency translation risk and exposure to changes in exchange rates 
in recent years  between and of our revenues have been generated outside the us  predominately in the united kingdom 
as a result  we are exposed to the risks involved in foreign operations  including changes in international tax laws and treaties  including increases of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  tariffs  trade barriers  and restrictions on the transfer of funds between nations  changes in international governmental regulations  the impact of local economic and political conditions  the impact of european commission regulation and the relationship between the united kingdom and continental europe  and increased competition and the impact from limited franchise protection in europe 
if our operations outside the us fail to perform as expected  we will be adversely impacted 
in addition  our results of operations and financial position are reported in local currency and are then translated into us dollars at the applicable foreign currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as exchange

table of contents dividends 
future quarterly or other cash dividends will depend upon our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  restrictions in any existing indebtedness and other factors considered relevant by the board of directors 
our us credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes each contain certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

overview on july   we changed our corporate name from united auto group  inc to penske automotive group  inc 
we are the second largest automotive retailer headquartered in the us as measured by total revenues 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises in the us and franchises outside of the us  primarily in the united kingdom 
we offer a full range of vehicle brands with of our total revenue in generated from non us brands and with sales relating to premium brands  such as audi  bmw  cadillac and porsche  representing of our total revenue 
each of our dealerships offers a wide selection of new and used vehicles for sale 
in addition to selling new and used vehicles  we offer a full range of maintenance and repair services  and we facilitate the placement of third party finance and insurance products  third party extended service contracts and replacement and aftermarket automotive products 
beginning in  our wholly owned subsidiary  smart usa distributor  llc  became the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo vehicle in the us and puerto rico 
new and used vehicle revenues include sales to retail customers and to leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
we generate finance and insurance revenues from sales of third party extended service contracts  sales of third party insurance policies  fees for facilitating the sale of third party finance and lease contracts and the sale of certain other products 
service and parts revenues include fees paid for repair  maintenance and collision services  the sale of replacement parts and the sale of aftermarket accessories 
smart usa distributor  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary  is the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo vehicle in us and puerto rico 
the smart fortwo is manufactured by mercedes benz cars and is a daimler brand 
this technologically advanced vehicle achieves plus miles per gallon on the highway and is an ultra low emissions vehicle as certified by the state of california air resources board 
though launched in the us in  more than  fortwo vehicles have previously been sold outside the us as distributor  smart usa is responsible for developing and maintaining a smart vehicle dealership network throughout the us and puerto rico 
smart usa has certified a network of smart dealerships in states  most of which have received the requisite licensing and other required approvals and are actively selling vehicles 
additional dealerships are expected to commence retailing vehicles during upon completion of their facilities and obtaining licensing approval 
of the dealerships currently planned in the us  eight are owned and operated by us 
the smart fortwo offers three different versions  the pure  passion and cabriolet with base prices ranging from  to  we currently expect to distribute at least  smart fortwo vehicles in we and sirius satellite radio inc sirius have agreed to jointly promote sirius satellite radio service 
pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with sirius  our dealerships in the us endeavor to order a significant percentage of eligible vehicles with a factory installed sirius radio 
we and sirius have also agreed to jointly market the sirius service under a best efforts arrangement through january  our costs relating to such marketing initiatives are expensed as incurred 
as compensation for our efforts  we received warrants to purchase ten million 
table of contents shares of sirius common stock at per share in that are being earned ratably on an annual basis through january we earned warrants to purchase two million shares in each of  and we measure the fair value of the warrants earned ratably on the date they are earned as there are no significant disincentives for non performance 
since we can reasonably estimate the number of warrants that will be earned pursuant to the ratable schedule  the estimated fair value based on current fair value of these warrants is being recognized ratably during each annual period 
through december   we also had the right to earn additional warrants to purchase sirius common stock at per share based upon the sale of certain units of specified brands 
we earned warrants for   and  shares during the years ended december   and  respectively 
since we could not reasonably estimate the number of warrants that were earned subject to the sale of units  the fair value of these warrants was recognized when they were earned 
the value of sirius stock has been and is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations  which may result in variability in the amount we earn under this arrangement 
the warrants may be cancelled upon the termination of our arrangement 
our gross profit tends to vary with the mix of revenues we derive from the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and service and parts 
our gross profit generally varies across product lines  with vehicle sales usually resulting in lower gross profit margins and our other revenues resulting in higher gross profit margins 
factors such as customer demand  general economic conditions  seasonality  weather  credit availability  fuel prices and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact the mix of our revenues  and therefore influence our gross profit margin 
our selling expenses consist of advertising and compensation for sales personnel  including commissions and related bonuses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation for administration  finance  legal and general management personnel  rent  insurance  utilities and other outside services 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable  and we believe a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses are subject to our control  allowing us to adjust them over time to reflect economic trends 
floor plan interest expense relates to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventories which is secured by those vehicles 
other interest expense consists of interest charges on all of our interest bearing debt  other than interest relating to floor plan financing 
the future success of our business will likely be dependent on  among other things  our ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions  our ability to increase sales of higher margin products  especially service and parts services  and our ability to realize returns on our significant capital investment in new and upgraded dealerships 
see item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve making estimates and employing judgments 
such judgments influence the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized in our financial statements 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews these estimates and assumptions 
management may determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are required  which may result in a material change in our results of operations or financial position 
the following are the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements that management believes are most dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition vehicle  parts and service sales we record revenue when vehicles are delivered and title has passed to the customer  when vehicle service or repair work is performed and when parts are delivered to our customers 
sales promotions that we offer to customers are accounted for as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale 
rebates and other incentives offered directly to us by manufacturers are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales 
reimbursement of qualified advertising expenses are 
table of contents treated as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the amounts received under various manufacturer rebate and incentive programs are based on the attainment of program objectives  and such earnings are recognized either upon the sale of the vehicle for which the award was received  or upon attainment of the particular program goals if not associated with individual vehicles 
during the year ended december   and  we earned million  million and million  respectively  of rebates  incentives and reimbursements from manufacturers  of which million  million and million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
finance and insurance sales subsequent to the sale of a vehicle to a customer  we sell our installment sale contracts to various financial institutions on a non recourse basis to mitigate the risk of default 
we receive a commission from the lender equal to either the difference between the interest rate charged to the customer and the interest rate set by the financing institution or a flat fee 
we also receive commissions for facilitating the sale of various third party insurance products to customers  including credit and life insurance policies and extended service contracts 
these commissions are recorded as revenue at the time the customer enters into the contract 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay or fail to pay their contract  thereby terminating the contract 
customers may also terminate extended service contracts and other insurance products  which are fully paid at purchase  and become eligible for refunds of unused premiums 
in these circumstances  a portion of the commissions we received may be charged back to us based on the terms of the contracts 
the revenue we record relating to these transactions is net of an estimate of the amount of chargebacks we will be required to pay 
our estimate is based upon our historical experience with similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on extended service contracts and other insurance products 
aggregate reserves relating to chargeback activity were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes in reserve estimates relate primarily to an increase in the amount of revenues subject to chargeback 
intangible assets our principal intangible assets relate to our franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers  which represent the estimated value of franchises acquired in business combinations  and goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
we believe the franchise value of our dealerships has an indefinite useful life based on the following facts automotive retailing is a mature industry and is based on franchise agreements with the vehicle manufacturers  there are no known changes or events that would alter the automotive retailing franchise environment  certain franchise agreement terms are indefinite  franchise agreements that have limited terms have historically been renewed without substantial cost  and our history shows that manufacturers have not terminated our franchise agreements 
impairment testing franchise value impairment is assessed as of october every year through a comparison of the carrying amounts of our franchises with their estimated fair values 
an indicator of impairment exists if the carrying value of a franchise exceeds its estimated fair value and an impairment loss may be recognized equal to that excess 
we also evaluate our franchises in connection with the annual impairment testing to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support our assessment that the franchise has an indefinite life 
goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level as of october every year and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment 
an indicator of impairment exists if the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill is determined to exceed its estimated fair value 
if an indication of impairment exists  the impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill and an impairment loss may be recognized equal to that excess 

table of contents the fair values of franchise value and goodwill are determined using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions that include revenue and profitability growth  franchise profit margins  residual values and our cost of capital 
if future events and circumstances cause significant changes in the assumptions underlying our analysis and result in a reduction of our estimates of fair value  we may incur an impairment charge 
investments investments include marketable securities and investments in businesses accounted for under the equity method 
a majority of our investments are in joint venture relationships that are more fully described in joint venture relationships below 
such joint venture relationships are accounted for under the equity method  pursuant to which we record our proportionate share of the joint venture s income each period 
the net book value of our investments was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
investments for which there is not a liquid  actively traded market are reviewed periodically by management for indicators of impairment 
if an indicator of impairment was identified  management would estimate the fair value of the investment using a discounted cash flow approach  which would include assumptions relating to revenue and profitability growth  profit margins  residual values and our cost of capital 
declines in investment values that are deemed to be other than temporary may result in an impairment charge reducing the investments carrying value to fair value 
during  we recorded an adjustment to the carrying value of our investment in internet brands to recognize an other than temporary impairment of million which became apparent upon their initial public offering 
investments in marketable securities held by us are typically classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value on our balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
declines in investment values that are deemed to be other than temporary would be an indicator of impairment and may result in an impairment charge reducing the investments carrying value to fair value 
self insurance we retain risk relating to certain of our general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance  auto physical damage insurance  property insurance  employment practices liability insurance  director s and officers insurance and employee medical benefits in the us 
as a result  we are likely to be responsible for a majority of the claims and losses incurred under these programs 
the amount of risk we retain varies by program  and  for certain exposures  we have pre determined maximum loss limits for certain individual claims and or insurance periods 
losses  if any  above the pre determined loss limits are paid by third party insurance carriers 
our estimate of future losses is prepared by management using our historical loss experience and industry based development factors 
aggregate reserves relating to retained risk were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes in the reserve estimate during relate primarily to changes in loss experience 
income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return  and some are timing differences  such as the timing of depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that will be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years which we have already recorded in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions taken on our tax return that have not yet been recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to allow for the use of the deduction or credit 
a valuation allowance of million has been recorded relating to state net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the us based on our determination that it is more likely than not that they will not be utilized 

table of contents classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results of our operations in our consolidated financial statements based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
which requires judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported within continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition  and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if we determine that a franchise should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods are revised to reflect such reclassification 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 fair value measurements defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements 
the fasb provided a one year deferral of the provisions of this pronouncement for non financial assets and liabilities  however  the relevant provisions of sfas required by sfas must be adopted as originally scheduled 
sfas thus becomes effective for our non financial assets and liabilities on january  we will continue to evaluate the impact of those elements of this pronouncement 
sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and consequently report unrealized gains and losses on such items in earnings 
since we will not elect the fair value option with respect to any of our current financial assets or financial liabilities when the provisions of this pronouncement become effective for us on january   there will be no impact upon the adoption 
sfas no 
r business combinations requires almost all assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date  liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period and all acquisition costs in pre acquisition periods to be expensed 
the pronouncement also clarifies the accounting under various scenarios such as step purchases or where the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration 
sfas r will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement 
sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary must be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity 
this pronouncement also outlines the accounting for changes in a parent s ownership in a subsidiary 
sfas will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement

the decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate was due primarily to the issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated notes on january  the proceeds of which were used to repay higher rate debt under our credit agreement 
income taxes income taxes decreased million  or  from to and increased million  or  from to the decrease from to is due primarily to a decrease in pre tax income 
our effective income tax rate in benefited from an increase in the relative proportion of our uk operations  which are taxed at a lower rate  but was higher on a comparative basis to the prior year due to tax savings from certain tax planning initiatives that benefited the prior year 
the increase from to is due primarily to an increase in pre tax income being more than offset by a reduction in our effective income tax rate due to an increase in the relative contribution to earnings of our uk operations  which are taxed at a lower rate  and tax savings from certain tax planning initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  inventory financing  the acquisition of new dealerships  the improvement and expansion of existing facilities  the construction of new facilities  and dividends 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and floor plan arrangements  the issuance of debt securities  sale leaseback transactions and the issuance of equity securities 
as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  available to fund our operations and capital commitments 
in addition  we had million and million million available for borrowing under our us credit agreement and our us credit agreement  respectively  each of which is discussed below 
we paid the following dividends in and per share dividends first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter we have also declared a cash dividend on our common stock of cents per share payable on march  to shareholders of record on february  future quarterly or other cash dividends will depend upon our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  restrictions on any then existing indebtedness and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
we have expanded our retail automotive operations primarily through organic growth and through the acquisition of retail automotive dealerships 
in addition  one of our subsidiaries is the exclusive distributor of smart fortwo vehicles in the us and puerto rico 
we believe that cash flow from operations and our existing capital resources  including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and floor plan financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operations and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent we pursue additional significant acquisitions  other expansion opportunities  or refinance existing debt  we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings  which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
we may  from time to time as market conditions warrant  purchase our outstanding common stock through open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions and other means 
we currently intend to fund any repurchases through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our us credit facility 
the decision to make stock repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value  the potential impact on our capital structure and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as strategic store acquisitions and capital investments in our current businesses  as well as any then existing limits imposed by our finance agreements 
inventory financing we finance substantially all of our new and a portion of our used vehicle inventories under revolving floor plan arrangements with various lenders

table of contents quarterly period commencing after march   if the closing price of our common stock for twenty of the last thirty trading days in the prior quarter exceeds subject to adjustment  for specified periods  if the trading price of the convertible notes falls below specific thresholds  if the convertible notes are called for redemption  if specified distributions to holders of our common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur  if a fundamental change as defined occurs  or during the ten trading days prior to  but excluding  the maturity date

share repurchase on january   we repurchased million shares of our outstanding common stock for million  or per share 
these shares and all other shares held as treasury stock were retired during the second quarter of interest rate swaps in january  we entered into new three year interest rate swap agreements pursuant to which the libor portion of million of our us floating rate floor plan debt was fixed at 
this arrangement is in effect through january we may terminate this arrangement at any time  subject to the settlement at that time of the fair value of the swap arrangement 
the swap is designated as a cash flow hedge of future interest payments of libor based us floor plan borrowings

table of contents other financing arrangements we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into significant sale leaseback transactions to finance certain property acquisitions and capital expenditures  pursuant to which we sell property and or leasehold improvements to third parties and agree to lease those assets back for a certain period of time 
such sales generate proceeds which vary from period to period 
off balance sheet arrangements convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  at the option of the holder  based on certain conditions described above 
certain of these conditions are linked to the market value of our common stock 
this type of financing arrangement was selected by us in order to achieve a more favorable interest rate as opposed to other forms of available financing 
since we or the holders of the convertible notes can redeem these notes on april  a conversion or a redemption of these notes is likely to occur in such redemption conversion will include cash for the principal amount of the convertible notes then outstanding plus an amount payable in either cash or stock  at our option  depending on the trading price of our common stock 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased by million during the year ended december   and decreased by and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the major components of these changes are discussed below 
cash flows from continuing operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital 
we finance substantially all of our new and a portion of our used vehicle inventories under revolving floor plan notes payable with various lenders 
in accordance with the guidance under sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  we report all cash flows arising in connection with floor plan notes payable to the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows and all cash flows arising in connection with floor plan notes payable to a party other than the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows 
however  we believe that changes in aggregate floor plan liabilities are typically linked to changes in vehicle inventory and  therefore  are an integral part of understanding changes in our working capital and operating cash flow 
as a result  we have presented the following reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities as reported in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as if all changes in vehicle floor plan were classified as an operating activity for informational purposes year ended december  net cash from operating activities as reported floor plan notes payable non trade as reported net cash from operating activities including all floor plan notes payable cash flows from continuing investing activities cash used in investing activities was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and net expenditures for dealership acquisitions 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate primarily to improvements to our existing dealership facilities and the construction of new facilities 
proceeds from sale leaseback transactions were million  million and million during the years ended december   and

cash used in business acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  and included repayments of seller s floor plan notes payable of million  million and million  respectively 
the year ended december  also includes million of proceeds of other investing activities 
cash flows from continuing financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and cash used in financing activities was million during the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities include borrowings and repayments of long term debt  net borrowings or repayments of floor plan notes payable non trade  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  including proceeds from the exercise of stock options  repurchases of common stock and dividends 
during the year ended december  we issued million of subordinated debt and we paid million of financing costs 
proceeds of the million of subordinated debt issuance were used to repurchase one million shares of our common stock and to repay debt 
this activity  combined with borrowing to fund acquisition and other liquidity requirements  resulted in net repayments of long term debt of million during the year ended december  and allowed us to redeem our notes in early for million  including redemption premium of million 
in addition to these activities  we had other net repayments of long term debt of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had net borrowings of floor plan notes payable non trade of and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and net repayments of floor plan notes payable non trade of million during the year ended december  during the years ended december   and  we received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  from exercises of options for common stock 
during the years ended december   and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  of cash dividends to our stockholders 
cash flows from discontinued operations cash flows relating to discontinued operations are not currently considered  nor are they expected to be considered material to our liquidity or our capital resources 
management does not believe that there is any significant past  present or upcoming cash transactions relating to discontinued operations 
contractual payment obligations the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future payments relating to our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of any relevant agreements 
future events  including acquisitions  divestitures  entering into new operating lease agreements  the amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit agreements and floor plan arrangements and purchases or refinancing of our securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see section a risk factors 
less than more than total year to years to years years floorplan notes payable a long term debt obligations b operating lease commitments purchase obligations scheduled interest payments b c other long term liabilities d a floor plan notes payable are revolving financing arrangements 
payments are generally made as required pursuant to the floor plan borrowing agreements discussed above under inventory financing 

table of contents b interest and principal repayments under our million of senior subordinated notes due are reflected in the table above  however  at our option  certain of these amounts may be settled by in shares of common stock 
while these notes are not due until  in the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash 
this acceleration of ultimate repayment is not reflected in the table above  nor is any optional redemption on our part 
c estimates of future variable rate interest payments under floorplan notes payable and our credit agreements are excluded 
see inventory financing  us credit agreement  and us credit agreement above for a discussion of such variable rates 
d includes uncertain tax positions 
due to the subjective nature of our uncertain tax positions  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of payments arising in connection with the unrecognized tax benefits 
we have thus classified this as more than years 
we expect that the amounts above will be funded through cash flow from operations 
in the case of balloon payments at the end of the terms of our debt instruments  we expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business 
commitments we are party to a joint venture with respect to our honda of mentor dealership in ohio

cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience periods of decline and recession similar to those experienced by the general economy 
we believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  fuel prices  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  vehicle demand  and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts  is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk in the uk  vehicles sold after march and september of each year reflect a later date of sale  decreasing their perceived residual value 

table of contents effects of inflation we believe that inflation rates over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
we do not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services  however  we cannot be sure there will be no such effect in the future 
we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on various benchmarks 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation

risk factors 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include those mentioned in item a 
risk factors such as the following the ability of automobile manufacturers to exercise significant control over our operations  since we depend on them in order to operate our business  because we depend on the success and popularity of the brands we sell  adverse conditions affecting one or more automobile manufacturers may negatively impact our revenues and profitability  we may not be able to satisfy our capital requirements for acquisitions  dealership renovation projects or financing the purchase of our inventory  our failure to meet a manufacturer s consumer satisfaction requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships  our ability to obtain incentive payments from manufacturers and our profitability  our business and the automotive retail industry in general are susceptible to adverse economic conditions  including changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  fuel prices and credit availability  substantial competition in automotive sales and services may adversely affect our profitability  
table of contents if we lose key personnel  especially our chief executive officer  or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business could be adversely affected  because most customers finance the cost of purchasing a vehicle  increased interest rates in the us or the us may adversely affect our vehicle sales  our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles profitably  our automobile dealerships are subject to substantial regulation which may adversely affect our profitability  if state dealer laws in the us are repealed or weakened  our us automotive dealerships may be subject to increased competition and may be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their franchise agreements  our uk dealerships are not afforded the same legal franchise protections as those in the us so we could be subject to additional competition from other local dealerships in the uk  our automotive dealerships are subject to environmental regulations that may result in claims and liabilities  our dealership operations may be affected by severe weather or other periodic business interruptions  our principal stockholders have substantial influence over us and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree  some of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain related party transactions and other business interests  our level of indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions and may require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service  we may be involved in legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business  our operations outside of the us subject our profitability to fluctuations relating to changes in foreign currency valuations especially as between the us dollar and british pound  in addition the price of our common stock is subject to substantial fluctuation  which may be unrelated to our performance  and shares eligible for future sale  or issuable under the terms of our convertible notes  may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
certain balances under our credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on a margin over defined benchmarks 
based on the amount outstanding as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over defined benchmarks 
we continually evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follow established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our 
table of contents earnings and cash flows 
we are currently party to swap agreements pursuant to which a notional million of our floating rate floor plan debt was exchanged for fixed rate debt through january based on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements subject to variable interest payments during the year ended december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value of our swaps and fixed rate debt  including the notes  the convertible notes and certain seller financed promissory notes  but  with respect to such fixed rate debt instruments  do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk and germany 
in each of these markets  the local currency is the functional currency 
due to the limited number of cross border transactions we are party to and our intent to remain permanently invested in these foreign markets  we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
in the event our operations change or we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our international operations  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million change to our revenues for the year ended december  in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase the majority of our inventories in the local functional currency  our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility which may influence such manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the local jurisdictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
