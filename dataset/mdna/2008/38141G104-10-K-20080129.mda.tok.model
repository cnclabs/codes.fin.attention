return on average tangible common shareholders equity was and return on average common shareholders equity was for book value per common share increased to at year end 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total cost of billion 
in  we generated record diluted earnings per common share  which exceeded the prior year record results by 
each of our three segments produced record net revenues 
the increase in trading and principal investments reflected higher net revenues in equities  fixed income  currency and commodities ficc and principal investments 
net revenues in equities increased compared with  reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both our customer franchise businesses and principal strategies 
during  equities operated in an environment characterized by strong customer driven activity  generally higher equity prices and higher levels of volatility  particularly during the second half of the year 
the increase in ficc reflected significantly higher net revenues in currencies and interest rate products 
in addition  net revenues in mortgages were higher despite a significant deterioration in the mortgage market throughout the year  while net revenues in credit products were strong  but slightly lower compared with credit products included substantial gains from equity investments  including a gain of approximately million related to the disposition of horizon wind energy llc  as well as a loss of approximately billion  net of hedges  related to non investment grade credit origination activities 
during  ficc operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity and favorable market opportunities 
however  during the year  the mortgage market experienced significant deterioration and  in the second half of the year  the broader credit markets were characterized by wider spreads and reduced levels of liquidity 
we continued to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves and  accordingly  our market risk increased  particularly in interest rate and equity products 
in addition  our total assets surpassed trillion during the year  as we grew our balance sheet in order to support these opportunities  as well as to support increased activity in securities services 
the increase in principal investments reflected strong results in both corporate and real estate investing 
the increase in investment banking reflected a increase in financial advisory net revenues and a strong performance in our underwriting business 
the increase in financial advisory primarily reflected growth in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions 
the increase in underwriting reflected higher net revenues in debt underwriting  as leveraged finance activity was strong during the first half of our fiscal year  while net revenues in equity underwriting were strong but essentially unchanged from our investment banking transaction backlog at the end of was higher than it was at the end of net revenues in asset management and securities services also increased 
the increase in securities services primarily reflected significant growth in global customer balances 
the increase in asset management reflected significantly higher asset management fees  partially offset by significantly lower incentive fees 
during the year  assets under management increased billion  or  to a record billion  including net inflows of billion 
return on average tangible common shareholders equity rote is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity

table of contents in  we will remain focused on our clients  geographic expansion and the importance of effective risk management 
we continue to see opportunities for growth in the businesses and geographic areas in which we operate and  in particular  we believe continued expansion of the economies of brazil  russia  india and china  as well as those of the middle east  will offer opportunities for us to increase our presence in those markets 
though we generated particularly strong results in  our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally

table of contents certain risk factors that may affect our business we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses  including market  liquidity  credit  operational  legal and regulatory risks 
for a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks  see risk management below 
a summary of the more important factors that could affect our business follows below 
for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business  see risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
market conditions and market risk 
our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally  and these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  high global gross domestic product growth  stable geopolitical conditions  transparent  liquid and efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions  which can be caused by outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability  declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation  interest rates  exchange rate volatility  default rates or the price of basic commodities  corporate  political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets  natural disasters or pandemics  or a combination of these or other factors  have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business and profitability in many ways  including the following increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads  especially if such changes are rapid  may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses  and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold 
for example  beginning in the second half of  difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets resulted in a relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the availability of credit and credit spreads widened significantly  affecting volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity markets 
we have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading  specialist and investing positions 
market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions 
conversely  certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
increases in interest rates or credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit  can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis  which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
we seek to finance our less liquid assets on a secured basis and disruptions in the credit markets are likely to make it harder and more expensive to fund these assets 
in difficult credit markets  we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 
this could cause us to curtail our business activities and could increase our cost of funding  both of which could reduce our profitability 
industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our revenues and  because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly  our profit margins 
our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions 
the lack of available credit or increased cost of credit may adversely affect the size  volume and timing of our clients merger and acquisition transactions particularly large transactions and adversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses 
reductions in the level of the equity markets or increases in interest rates tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets 

table of contents increases in interest rates or attractive conditions in other investments could cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products 
even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions  investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors could result in a decline in assets under management and in the incentive and management fees we receive and might make it more difficult to attract new investors 
concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making  proprietary trading and investing  block trading  merchant banking  underwriting and lending businesses 
this risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer driven business 
an increase in market volatility increases our measured risk  which might cause us to reduce our proprietary positions or to reduce certain of our business activities 
in such circumstances  we may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure in a timely  cost effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset the increase in measured risk 
the volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and as a specialist or market maker may decline  which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads 
in our specialist businesses  we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market  including by purchasing shares in a declining market 
this may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity 
weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets  an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries  an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments  or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us  or even by the perception among market participants that we are experiencing greater liquidity risk 
the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex  as we employ structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves  and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress 
growth of our proprietary investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets  which could restrict liquidity for our positions 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time  as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis 
in addition  financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set off rights or the right to require additional collateral  including in difficult market conditions  which could further impair our access to liquidity 
our credit ratings are important to our liquidity 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts 
under these provisions  counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with goldman sachs or require us to post additional collateral 
termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements 
for a discussion of the potential impact on goldman sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings  see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below 
credit risk 
the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years  as has the breadth and size of the entities to which we have credit exposures 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against 
table of contents third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
in addition  deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes 
a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results 
while in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral for counterparties that experience financial difficulty  disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets 
in addition  as part of our clearing business  we finance our client positions  and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries  countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee  particularly as new business initiatives lead us to transact with a broader array of clients and expose us to new asset classes and new markets 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect us 
we have experienced  due to competitive factors  pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take 
in particular  corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments 
operational risk 
shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  or external events could lead to impairment of our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions  many of which are highly complex  across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
these transactions  as well as information technology services we provide to clients  often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
legal and regulatory risk 
we are subject to extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the world 
several of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements and  as a consolidated supervised entity cse  we are subject to minimum capital standards on a consolidated basis 
substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us  which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high 
for a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures  see use of estimates below 

table of contents critical accounting policies fair value the use of fair value to measure financial instruments  with related unrealized gains or losses generally recognized in trading and principal investments in our consolidated statements of earnings  is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
instruments that we own long positions are marked to bid prices  and instruments that we have sold  but not yet purchased short positions are marked to offer prices 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as of the beginning of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information on sfas no 
in determining fair value  we separate our financial instruments  owned at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value into two categories cash instruments and derivative contracts  as set forth in the following table financial instruments by category in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments financial instruments instruments sold  but not yet instruments sold  but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value cash trading instruments icbc smfg other principal investments principal investments cash instruments exchange traded over the counter derivative contracts total the fair value of our japanese yen denominated investment in the convertible preferred stock of sumitomo mitsui financial group  inc smfg includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation  for which we maintain an economic currency hedge 
includes interests of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
the fair value of our investment in the ordinary shares of industrial and commercial bank of china limited icbc  which trade on the stock exchange of hong kong  includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation for which we maintain an economic currency hedge 

table of contents the following table sets forth the principal investments in addition to our investments in icbc and smfg included within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment as of november corporate real estate total corporate real estate total in millions private public total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
represents an economic hedge on the shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
net of cash paid pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
cash instruments 
cash instruments include cash trading instruments  public principal investments and private principal investments 
cash trading instruments 
our cash trading instruments are generally valued using quoted market prices in active markets  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most us government and agency securities  many other sovereign government obligations  active listed equities and most money market securities 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include most investment grade and high yield corporate bonds  most mortgage products  certain corporate bank and bridge loans  less liquid listed equities  state  municipal and provincial obligations  most physical commodities and certain loan commitments 
certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency 
such instruments include private equity and real estate fund investments  certain corporate bank and bridge loans  less liquid mortgage whole loans  distressed debt instruments and certain loan commitments 
the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value 
accordingly  when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument  the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price 
this valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
public principal investments 
our public principal investments held within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment tend to be large  concentrated holdings resulting from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions  and are valued based on quoted market prices 
for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 

table of contents our most significant public principal investment is our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc 
our investment in icbc is valued using the quoted market prices adjusted for transfer restrictions 
the ordinary shares acquired from icbc are subject to transfer restrictions that  among other things  prohibit any sale  disposition or other transfer until april  from april  to october   we may transfer up to of the aggregate ordinary shares of icbc that we owned as of october  we may transfer the remaining shares after october  a portion of our interest is held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
we also have an investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
this investment is valued using a model that is principally based on smfg s common stock price 
as of november  the conversion price of our smfg convertible preferred stock into shares of smfg common stock was  this price is subject to downward adjustment if the price of smfg common stock at the time of conversion is less than the conversion price subject to a floor of 
as a result of downside protection on the conversion stock price  the relationship between changes in the fair value of our investment and changes in smfg s common stock price would be nonlinear for a significant decline in the smfg common stock price 
as of november  we had hedged approximately of the common stock underlying our investment in smfg and there were no restrictions on our ability to hedge the remainder 
private principal investments 
our private principal investments held within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment include investments in private equity  debt and real estate  primarily held through investment funds 
by their nature  these investments have little or no price transparency 
we value such instruments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations when evidence is available to support such adjustments 
such evidence includes transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
derivative contracts 
derivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter otc 
we generally value exchange traded derivatives within portfolios using models which calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing differences between the closing price of the exchange traded derivatives and their underlying cash instruments 
otc derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible  including market based inputs to models  model calibration to market clearing transactions  broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
where models are used  the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
valuation models require a variety of inputs  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 
certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information  and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult 
where we do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions  transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value 
accordingly  when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument  the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price 
subsequent to initial recognition  we only update valuation inputs when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions  third party 
table of contents pricing services and or broker or dealer quotations  or other empirical market data 
in circumstances where we cannot verify the model value to market transactions  it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 
see credit risk derivatives below for further information on our otc derivatives 
when appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity  bid offer spreads and credit considerations 
such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
fair value hierarchy level assets 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding sfas no 

table of contents the following table sets forth the fair values of assets classified as level within the fair value hierarchy  along with a brief description of the valuation technique for each type of asset level assets at fair value in millions as of valuation description november technique private equity and real estate fund investments  initially valued at transaction price

other financial assets and financial liabilities 
in addition to financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value  we have elected to account for certain of our other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
such financial assets and financial liabilities include i certain unsecured short term borrowings  consisting of all promissory notes and commercial paper and certain hybrid financial instruments  ii certain other secured financings  primarily transfers accounted for as financings rather than sales under sfas no 
and debt raised through our william street program  iii certain unsecured long term borrowings  including prepaid physical commodity transactions  iv resale and repurchase agreements  v securities borrowed and loaned within trading and principal investments  consisting of our matched book and certain firm financing activities  vi corporate loans  loan commitments and certificates of deposit issued by goldman sachs bank usa gs bank usa as well as securities held by gs bank usa previously accounted for as available for sale  vii receivables from customers and counterparties arising from transfers accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases under sfas no 
 and viii in general  investments acquired after the adoption of sfas no 
where we have significant influence over the investee and would otherwise apply the equity method of accounting 
see recent accounting developments below for a discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no 
controls over valuation of financial instruments 
a control infrastructure  independent of the trading and investing functions  is fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable 
we employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties 
senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies to our audit committee 
we seek to maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control functions are performed to the highest standards 
we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets  price verification  review of daily profit and loss  and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets 
these procedures are performed by personnel independent of the trading and investing functions 
for trading and principal investments where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable  we employ  where possible  procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions  analysis of actual to projected cash flows  comparisons with subsequent sales and discussions with senior business leaders

table of contents goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally slk llc slk in  the ayco company  lp ayco in and our variable annuity and life insurance business in  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments  which are components one level below our three business segments  for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings and price book multiples 
we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each operating segment 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fourth quarter and no impairment was identified 
the following table sets forth the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment goodwill by operating segment in millions as of november investment banking financial advisory underwriting trading and principal investments ficc equities principal investments asset management and securities services asset management securities services total primarily related to slk 
primarily related to ayco 
the increase in goodwill from november relates to our acquisition of macquarie imm investment management 
identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment loss  calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 

table of contents the following table sets forth the carrying value and range of remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class identifiable intangible assets by asset class in millions as of november range of estimated remaining useful carrying lives carrying value in years value customer lists new york stock exchange nyse specialist rights insurance related assets exchange traded fund etf specialist rights power contracts other total primarily includes our clearance and execution and nasdaq customer lists related to slk and financial counseling customer lists related to ayco 
consists of the value of business acquired voba and deferred acquisition costs dac 
voba represents the present value of estimated future gross profits of the variable annuity and life insurance business 
dac results from commissions paid by goldman sachs to the primary insurer ceding company on life and annuity reinsurance agreements as compensation to place the business with us and to cover the ceding company s acquisition expenses 
voba and dac are amortized over the estimated life of the underlying contracts based on estimated gross profits  and amortization is adjusted based on actual experience 
the seven year useful life represents the weighted average remaining amortization period of the underlying contracts certain of which extend for approximately years 
the reduction in power contracts from november is due to the sale of the majority of our ownership interests in power generation facilities during primarily includes marketing and technology related assets 
a prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i changes in market structure that could adversely affect our specialist businesses see discussion below  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or iii adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life insurance business 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of continuing weak operating results in our nyse specialist business  we tested our nyse specialist rights for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of our nyse specialist rights exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows of the business over the estimated remaining useful life of our nyse specialist rights 
projected undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of our nyse specialist rights  and accordingly  we did not record an impairment loss 

table of contents we expect that the nyse will enact numerous rule changes in that will further align its model with investor requirements for speed and efficiency of execution and will establish specialists as designated market makers dmms 
as dmms  specialists will retain their obligation to commit capital but for the first time  specialists will be able to trade on parity with other market participants 
in addition  we understand that the nyse plans to introduce a reserve order system that will allow for anonymous trade execution and is expected to increase liquidity and market share 
the new rules are expected to bolster the nyse s competitive position by simplifying trading and advancing the nyse s goal of increasing execution speeds 
in projecting the undiscounted cash flows of the business for the purpose of performing our impairment test  we made several important assumptions about the potential beneficial effects of the expected rule and market structure changes described above 
specifically  we assumed that overall equity trading volumes will continue to grow at a rate consistent with recent historical trends  the nyse will be able to recapture approximately one half of the market share that it lost in  and we will increase the market share of our nyse specialist business and  as a dmm  the profitability of each share traded 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions  rule or structure changes described above will result in sufficient cash flows to avoid future impairment of our nyse specialist rights 
as of november   the carrying value of our nyse specialist rights was million 
to the extent that there were to be an impairment in the future  it could result in a significant writedown in the carrying value of these specialist rights 
use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

the increase in investment banking reflected a increase in financial advisory net revenues and a strong performance in our underwriting business 
the increase in financial advisory primarily reflected growth in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions 
the increase in underwriting reflected higher net revenues in debt underwriting  as leveraged finance activity was strong during the first half of our fiscal year  while net revenues in equity underwriting were strong but essentially unchanged from net revenues in asset management and securities services also increased 
the increase in securities services primarily reflected significant growth in global customer balances

the increase in principal investments reflected a significant gain related to our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc and higher gains and overrides from other principal investments  partially offset by a smaller  but still significant  gain related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
the increase in investment banking was due to significantly higher net revenues in underwriting and financial advisory  as we benefited from strong client activity levels  reflecting favorable equity and financing markets  strong ceo confidence and growth in financial sponsor activity 

table of contents the increase in asset management and securities services was primarily due to higher assets under management and significantly higher incentive fees  as well as significantly higher global customer balances in securities services 
assets under management increased billion or to a record billion  including net asset inflows of billion during operating expenses our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation  headcount and levels of business activity

this amount represents the majority of the expense to be recognized with respect to these awards 
non compensation expenses of billion for increased compared with excluding non compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes  non compensation expenses were higher than  primarily due to higher brokerage  clearing  exchange and distribution fees in equities and ficc  and increased other expenses  primarily due to costs related to our insurance business  which was acquired in in addition  market development costs and professional fees were higher  reflecting increased levels of business activity  and occupancy expenses increased  primarily reflecting new office space and higher facility expenses

the fees that we charge vary by asset class  as do our related expenses 
in certain circumstances  we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund s return or when the return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other performance targets

our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  including total return swaps  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit and representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  including the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages  home equity and auto loans  government and corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets 
other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions  providing secondary market liquidity  making investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
we engage in transactions with variable interest entities vies and qualifying special purpose entities qspes 
such vehicles are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting 
while we are routinely involved with vies and qspes in connection with our securitization activities  we did not have off balance sheet commitments to purchase or finance collateralized debt obligations held by structured investment vehicles as of november the following table sets forth where a discussion of these and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in part ii  items and of the annual report on form k type of off balance sheet arrangement disclosure in annual report on form k retained interests or contingent interests in assets transferred by us to nonconsolidated entities see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k

table of contents equity capital the level and composition of our equity capital are principally determined by our consolidated regulatory capital requirements but may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to extreme and adverse changes in our business and market environments 
as of november  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion compared with total shareholders equity of billion as of november consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
in addition to total shareholders equity  we consider the billion of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts see discussion below to be part of our equity capital  as it qualifies as capital for regulatory and certain rating agency purposes 
consolidated regulatory capital requirements goldman sachs is regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec as a cse and  as such  is subject to group wide supervision and examination by the sec and to minimum capital adequacy standards on a consolidated basis 
minimum capital adequacy standards are principally driven by the amount of our market risk  credit risk and operational risk as calculated by methodologies approved by the sec 
eligible sources of regulatory capital include common equity and certain types of preferred stock  debt and hybrid capital instruments  including our junior subordinated debt issued to trusts 
the recognition of preferred stock  debt and hybrid capital instruments as regulatory capital is subject to limitations 
goldman sachs was in compliance with the cse capital adequacy standards as of november and november rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of the goldman sachs group  inc  which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of goldman sachs senior unsecured obligations 
the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings 
each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation 
see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below for further information regarding our credit ratings 
subsidiary capital requirements many of our principal subsidiaries are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements in the united states and or elsewhere 
goldman  sachs co 
and goldman sachs execution clearing  lp are registered us broker dealers and futures commissions merchants  and are subject to regulatory capital requirements  including those imposed by the sec  the commodity futures trading commission  the chicago board of trade  the financial industry regulatory authority finra and the national futures association 
goldman sachs international  our regulated uk broker dealer  is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the uk s financial services authority 
goldman sachs japan co  ltd  our regulated japanese broker dealer  is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by japan s financial services agency 
several other subsidiaries of goldman sachs are regulated by securities  investment advisory  banking  insurance  and other regulators and authorities around the world 
as of november and november  these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements 

table of contents as discussed above  many of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world 
subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines  rating agency requirements for entities with assigned credit ratings or internal policies  including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk 
see liquidity and funding risk conservative liability structure below for a discussion of our potential inability to access funds from our subsidiaries 
equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with parent company equity capital 
as of november  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion compared with its total shareholders equity of billion 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivative contracts and non us denominated debt 
in addition  we generally manage the non trading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entity s functional currency 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our regulated subsidiaries 
equity capital management our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal composition of equity capital 
we manage our capital through repurchases of our common stock and issuances of preferred stock  junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt 
we manage our capital requirements principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and or limits on risk  in each case at both the consolidated and business unit levels 
we attribute capital usage to each of our business units based upon the cse regulatory capital framework and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established 
share repurchase program 
we use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity and to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share based compensation 
the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open market purchases  the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital positions ie  comparisons of our desired level of capital to our actual level of capital but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock 
the following table sets forth the level of share repurchases for the years ended november and november as of november in millions  except per share amounts number of shares repurchased total cost average cost per share the repurchase program was increased by million shares on december  taking into account this increased authorization  the total remaining authorization under the repurchase program was million shares as of january  for additional information on our repurchase program  see market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in part ll  item of the annual report on form k 

table of contents preferred stock 
as of november  goldman sachs had  shares of perpetual non cumulative preferred stock issued and outstanding in four series as set forth in the following table preferred stock by series shares shares earliest redemption value series issued authorized dividend rate redemption date in millions a   month libor  with floor of per annum april  b   per annum october  c   month libor  with floor of per annum october  d   month libor  with floor of per annum may   each share of preferred stock issued and outstanding has a par value of  has a liquidation preference of  is represented by  depositary shares and is redeemable at our option at a redemption price equal to  plus declared and unpaid dividends 
dividends on each series of preferred stock  if declared  are payable quarterly in arrears 
our ability to declare or pay dividends on  or purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire  our common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event that we fail to pay or set aside full dividends on our preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period 
all series of preferred stock are pari passu and have a preference over our common stock upon liquidation 
junior subordinated debt issued to trusts in connection with normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities 
in the second quarter of  we issued billion of fixed rate junior subordinated debt to goldman sachs capital ii and million of floating rate junior subordinated debt to goldman sachs capital iii  delaware statutory trusts that  in turn  issued billion of guaranteed perpetual automatic preferred enhanced capital securities apex to third parties and a de minimis amount of common securities to goldman sachs 
the junior subordinated debt is included in unsecured long term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
in connection with the apex issuance  we entered into stock purchase contracts with goldman sachs capital ii and iii under which we will be obligated to sell and these entities will be obligated to purchase billion of perpetual non cumulative preferred stock that we will issue in the future 
goldman sachs capital ii and iii are required to remarket the junior subordinated debt in order to fund their purchase of the preferred stock  but in the event that a remarketing is unsuccessful  they will relinquish the subordinated debt to us in exchange for the preferred stock 
because of certain characteristics of the junior subordinated debt and the associated apex  including its long term nature  the future issuance of perpetual non cumulative preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts  our ability to defer payments due on the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure  it qualifies as regulatory capital for cse purposes and is included as part of our equity capital 
junior subordinated debt issued to a trust in connection with trust preferred securities 
we issued billion of junior subordinated debentures in the first quarter of to goldman sachs capital i  a delaware statutory trust that  in turn  issued billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests to third parties and million of common beneficial interests to goldman sachs 
the junior subordinated debentures are included in unsecured long term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
because of certain characteristics of the junior subordinated debt and the associated trust preferred securities  including its long term nature  our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure  it qualifies as regulatory capital for cse purposes and is included as part of our equity capital 

table of contents subordinated debt 
in addition to junior subordinated debt issued to trusts  we had other outstanding subordinated debt of billion as of november although not part of our shareholders equity  subordinated debt may be used to meet a portion of our consolidated capital requirements as a cse 
capital ratios and metrics the following table sets forth information on our assets  shareholders equity  leverage ratios and book value per common share as of november in millions  except per share amounts total assets adjusted assets total shareholders equity tangible equity capital leverage ratio x x adjusted leverage ratio x x debt to equity ratio x x common shareholders equity tangible common shareholders equity book value per common share tangible book value per common share adjusted assets excludes i low risk collateralized assets generally associated with our matched book and securities lending businesses which we calculate by adding our securities borrowed and financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell  at fair value  and then subtracting our nonderivative short positions  ii cash and securities we segregate for regulatory and other purposes and iii goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts 
we do not deduct identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts from total assets in order to be consistent with the calculation of tangible equity capital and the adjusted leverage ratio see footnote below 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of total assets to adjusted assets as of november in millions total assets deduct securities borrowed   financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell  at fair value   add financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value less derivative liabilities   subtotal   deduct cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts   adjusted assets 
table of contents tangible equity capital equals total shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to trusts less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts 
we do not deduct identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts from total shareholders equity because  unlike other intangible assets  less than of these assets are supported by common shareholders equity 
we consider junior subordinated debt issued to trusts to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to certain characteristics of the debt  including its long term nature  our ability to defer payments due on the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure 
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity capital as of november in millions total shareholders equity add junior subordinated debt issued to trusts   deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts   tangible equity capital leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses 
debt to equity ratio equals unsecured long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity 
tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts 
we do not deduct identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts from total shareholders equity because  unlike other intangible assets  less than of these assets are supported by common shareholders equity 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible common shareholders equity as of november in millions total shareholders equity deduct preferred stock   common shareholders equity deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts   tangible common shareholders equity book value per common share is based on common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements  of million and million as of november and november  respectively 
tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements

our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements 
this excess space  the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred  is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future 
we regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels

we may incur additional exit costs in and thereafter to the extent we i reduce our space capacity or ii commit to  or occupy  new properties in the locations in which we operate and  consequently  dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth 
these exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

table of contents as of november and november  we had construction related obligations of million and billion  respectively  including outstanding commitments of million and million as of november and november  respectively  related to our new world headquarters in new york city  which is expected to cost between billion and billion 
we are partially financing this construction project with tax exempt liberty bonds 
we borrowed approximately billion and approximately million in and  respectively  through the issuance of liberty bonds 
in addition  we entered into an agreement in to acquire litton  the mortgage servicing unit of credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass

in connection with our lending activities  we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of billion as of november compared with billion as of november since these commitments may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty s request  the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements 
our commercial lending commitments are generally extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and other types of corporate lending as well as commercial real estate financing 
we may seek to reduce our credit risk on these commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to other investors 
in addition  commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended to be short term in nature  as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources 

table of contents substantially all of the commitments provided under the william street credit extension program are to investment grade corporate borrowers 
commitments under the program are extended by william street commitment corporation commitment corp  a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of group inc whose assets and liabilities are legally separated from other assets and liabilities of goldman sachs  william street credit corporation  gs bank usa  goldman sachs credit partners lp or other consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries of group inc the commitments extended by commitment corp

with respect to most of the william street commitments  smfg provides us with credit loss protection that is generally limited to of the first loss we realize on approved loan commitments  up to a maximum of billion 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  upon our request  smfg will provide protection for of the second loss on such commitments  up to a maximum of billion 
we also use other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain william street commitments not covered by smfg 
our commitments to extend credit also include financing for the warehousing of financial assets to be securitized 
these financings are expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the related securitizations for which we may or may not act as underwriter 
these arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets  primarily consisting of corporate bank loans and commercial mortgages as of november and residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities  corporate bank loans and commercial mortgages as of november see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our commitments  contingencies and guarantees 
risk management management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of goldman sachs 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor  evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these risks include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal and reputational exposures 
risk management structure we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial  credit  operational  compliance and legal reporting systems 
in addition  a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process  as described further below 
these committees including their subcommittees  meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units 
segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process 
in addition to the committees described below  functions that are independent of the revenue producing units  such as compliance  finance  legal  management controls internal audit and operations  perform risk management functions  which include monitoring  analyzing and evaluating risk 
management committee 
all risk control functions ultimately report to our management committee 
through both direct and delegated authority  the management committee approves all of our operating activities and trading risk parameters 
risk committees 
the firmwide risk committee reviews the activities of existing trading businesses  approves new businesses and products  approves firmwide market risk limits  reviews business unit market risk limits  approves market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and 
table of contents business units  approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group  and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements 
the divisional risk committee sets market risk limits for our trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk limits  based on a number of measures  including var  stress tests and scenario analyses 
several other committees oversee various risk  valuation  operational  credit and business practice issues related to our asset management business 
business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks 
trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
market risk limits are monitored by the finance division and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee 
limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and business unit managers and addressed  as necessary 
credit risk limits are also monitored by the finance division and reviewed by the appropriate risk committee 
business practices committee 
the business practices committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance and operational risks and related reputational concerns  seeks to ensure the consistency of our policies  practices and procedures with our business principles  and makes recommendations on ways to mitigate potential risks 
firmwide capital committee 
the firmwide capital committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital 
such capital commitments include  but are not limited to  extensions of credit  alternative liquidity commitments  certain bond underwritings and certain distressed debt and principal finance activities 
the firmwide capital committee is also responsible for establishing business and reputational standards for capital commitments and seeking to ensure that they are maintained on a global basis 
commitments committee 
the commitments committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities  primarily with respect to offerings of equity and equity related securities  and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal  reputational  regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities 
in addition to reviewing specific transactions  the commitments committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices

finance committee 
the finance committee establishes and oversees our liquidity policies  sets certain inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk  the size and composition of our balance sheet and capital base  and our credit ratings 
the finance committee regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events  risks and exposures 
new products committee 
the new products committee  under the oversight of the firmwide risk committee  is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and businesses globally 
operational risk committee 
the operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies  framework and methodologies  and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management 
structured products committee 
the structured products committee reviews and approves structured product transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal  regulatory  tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to goldman sachs 

table of contents market risk the potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk 
such positions result from market making  proprietary trading  underwriting  specialist and investing activities 
substantially all of our inventory positions are marked to market on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues 
categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
a description of each market risk category is set forth below interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
we seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
for example  we may hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract 
the ability to manage an exposure may  however  be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument 
in addition to applying business judgment  senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk for financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
these tools include risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as var  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and inventory position limits for selected business units 

table of contents var var is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
for the var numbers reported below  a one day time horizon and a confidence level were used 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
thus  shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported var would be anticipated to occur  on average  about once a month 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
we use historical data to estimate our var and  to better reflect current asset volatilities  we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
different var methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different var 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
the following tables set forth the daily var average daily var in millions year ended november risk categories interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var  where var is not the most appropriate measure of risk eg  due to transfer restrictions and or illiquidity 
see other market risk measures below 
equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure and volatility in interest rates and equity prices 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in we increased our level of exposure across all risk categories  particularly equity prices and interest rates 

table of contents daily var in millions year ended as of november november risk categories high low interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our daily var increased to million as of november from million as of november the increase primarily reflected higher levels of exposure to interest rates  currency rates and commodity prices  as well as increased levels of volatility in interest rates  partially offset by the benefit of increased diversification effects among different risk categories

table of contents trading net revenues distribution the following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in var for the year ended november daily trading net revenues in millions bar chart as part of our overall risk control process  daily trading net revenues are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day 
trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on ten occasions during other market risk measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var  where var is not the most appropriate measure of risk eg  due to transfer restrictions and or illiquidity 
the market risk related to our investments in the ordinary shares of icbc and the convertible preferred stock of smfg is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in the icbc ordinary share price and a decline in the smfg common stock price  respectively 
the market risk related to the remaining positions is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in asset values 
the sensitivity analyses for equity and debt positions in our trading portfolio and equity  debt primarily mezzanine instruments and real estate positions in our non trading portfolio are measured by the impact of a decline in the asset values including the impact of leverage in the underlying investments for real estate positions in our non trading portfolio of such positions 
the fair value of the underlying positions may be impacted by factors such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
the sensitivity analysis of our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc excludes interests held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
the sensitivity analysis of our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg  net of the economic hedge on a substantial portion of the common stock underlying our investment  is 
table of contents measured by the impact of a decline in the smfg common stock price 
this sensitivity should not be extrapolated to a significant decline in the smfg common stock price  as the relationship between the fair value of our investment and the smfg common stock price would be nonlinear due to downside protection on the conversion stock price 
the following table sets forth market risk for positions not included in var 
these measures do not reflect diversification benefits across asset categories and  given the differing likelihood of the potential declines in asset categories  these measures have not been aggregated sensitivity amount as of november asset categories sensitivity measure in millions trading risk equity underlying asset value  debt underlying asset value  non trading risk icbc icbc ordinary share price smfg smfg common stock price other equity underlying asset value  debt underlying asset value real estate underlying asset value  in addition to the positions in these portfolios  which are accounted for at fair value  we make investments accounted for under the equity method and we also make direct investments in real estate  both of which are included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for information on other assets 
relates to interests in our real estate investment funds 
the increase in our sensitivity measures during in our trading and non trading portfolios excluding icbc and smfg was primarily due to new investments 
in addition  as of november and november  in our bank and insurance subsidiaries we held approximately billion and billion of securities  respectively  primarily consisting of mortgage backed  federal agency and investment grade corporate bonds 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us  or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or other instruments  including otc derivatives  we hold 
our exposure to credit risk principally arises through our trading  investing and financing activities 
to reduce our credit exposures  we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
in addition  we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by i entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis  ii seeking third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations  and or iii transferring our credit risk to third parties using credit derivatives and or other structures and techniques 
to measure and manage our credit exposures  we use a variety of tools  including credit limits referenced to both current exposure and potential exposure 
potential exposure is generally based on projected worst case market movements over the life of a transaction 
in addition  as part of our market risk management process  for positions measured by changes in credit spreads  we use var 
table of contents and other sensitivity measures 
to supplement our primary credit exposure measures  we also use scenario analyses  such as credit spread widening scenarios  stress tests and other quantitative tools 
our global credit management systems monitor credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates 
these systems also provide management  including the firmwide risk and credit policy committees  with information regarding credit risk by product  industry sector  country and region 
while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties  we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment funds and other institutional clients  resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry 
in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty  borrower or issuer 
as of november and november  we held billion of total assets and billion of total assets  respectively  of us government and federal agency obligations including securities guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation included in financial instruments owned  at fair value and cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
as of november and november  we held billion of total assets and billion of total assets  respectively  of other sovereign obligations  principally consisting of securities issued by the governments of japan and the united kingdom 
in addition  as of november and november  billion and billion of our financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed  respectively  were collateralized by us government and federal agency obligations 
as of november and  billion and billion of our financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed  respectively  were collateralized by other sovereign obligations 
as of november and november  we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded of our total assets 
however  over the past several years  the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing  due to  among other factors  the growth of our lending and otc derivative activities and market evolution toward longer dated transactions 
a further discussion of our derivative activities follows below 
derivatives derivative contracts are instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps or option contracts  that derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into to facilitate client transactions  to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management 
in addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes  we enter into derivative contracts to manage currency exposure on our net investment in non us operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings 
derivatives are used in many of our businesses  and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged  or as part of a broader trading strategy 
accordingly  the market risk of derivative positions is managed together with our nonderivative positions 
the fair value of our derivative contracts is reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and is reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
for an otc derivative  our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract 

table of contents the following tables set forth the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity otc derivatives in millions as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total includes credit derivatives 
we enter into certain otc option transactions that provide us or our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the underlying contract 
the fair value of these option contracts is not material to the aggregate fair value of our otc derivative portfolio 
in the tables above  for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument  the remaining contractual maturity is generally classified based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument 
in those instances where the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash  the remaining contractual maturity is generally based upon the option expiration date 

table of contents the following table sets forth the distribution  by credit rating  of substantially all of our exposure with respect to otc derivatives as of november  after taking into consideration the effect of netting agreements 
the categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents otc derivative credit exposure in millions as of as of november november exposure percentage of percentage of collateral net of total exposure total exposure credit rating equivalent exposure held collateral net of collateral net of collateral aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion

includes credit derivatives 

table of contents derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty  that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty 
we attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction 
in addition  certain derivative transactions eg  credit derivative contracts involve the risk that we may have difficulty obtaining  or be unable to obtain  the underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical settlement requirement 
liquidity and funding risk liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector 
most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances 
accordingly  goldman sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both goldman sachs specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund goldman sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenues  even under adverse circumstances 
management has implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework excess liquidity we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment including financing obligations 
asset liability management we seek to maintain funding sources that are sufficiently long term in order to withstand a prolonged or severe liquidity stressed environment without having to rely on asset sales 
conservative liability structure we access funding across a diverse range of markets  products and counterparties  emphasize less credit sensitive sources of funding and conservatively manage the distribution of funding across our entity structure 
crisis planning we base our liquidity and funding management on stress scenario planning and maintain a crisis plan detailing our response to a liquidity threatening event 
excess liquidity our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity 
this global core excess liquidity is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
we believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
our global core excess reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
goldman sachs businesses are diverse  and its cash needs are driven by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater 
table of contents balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our unsecured liabilities 
the size of our global core excess is based on an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
our liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis  including  but not limited to upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit  potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt  adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding  derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows  including those due to market moves  potential cash outflows associated with our prime brokerage business  additional collateral that could be called in the event of a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings  draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by william street funding corporation  and upcoming cash outflows  such as tax and other large payments 
the following table sets forth the average loan value the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities of our global core excess year ended november in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total global core excess the us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered us government securities  us agency securities and highly liquid us agency mortgage backed securities  all of which are federal reserve repo eligible  as well as overnight cash deposits 
our non us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds and euro  british pound and japanese yen overnight cash deposits 
we strictly limit our global core excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash because we believe they are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
we do not believe other potential sources of excess liquidity  such as lower quality unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities  are as reliable in a liquidity crisis 
the majority of our global core excess is structured such that it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and all of its subsidiaries 
the remainder is held in our principal non us operating entities  primarily to better match the currency and timing requirements for those entities potential liquidity obligations 
in addition to our global core excess  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities 
these assets  which are located in the united states  europe and asia  include other government bonds  high grade money market securities  corporate bonds and marginable equities 
we do not include these securities in our global core excess 
the global core excess excludes liquid assets of billion held separately by william street funding corporation 
see contractual obligations and commitments above for a further discussion of the william street credit extension program 

table of contents we maintain global core excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that  if pledged or sold  would provide the funds necessary to replace at least of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature or where holders have the option to redeem within the next months 
we assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions asset class by asset class 
the estimated aggregate loan value of our global core excess and our other unencumbered assets averaged billion and billion for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
asset liability management we seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily 
we utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
we believe that these limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard position limits 
although our balance sheet fluctuates due to seasonal activity  market conventions and periodic market opportunities in certain of our businesses  our total assets and adjusted assets at financial statement dates are not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods 
we seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due  even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress 
we do not rely on immediate sales of assets other than our global core excess to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment  although we recognize orderly asset sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity crisis 
in order to avoid reliance on asset sales  our goal is to ensure that we have sufficient total capital unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity to fund our balance sheet for at least one year 
the amount of our total capital is based on an internal liquidity model  which incorporates  among other things  the following long term financing requirements the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming conservative loan values  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets  derivative and other margin and collateral requirements  anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments  and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that is in excess of their long term financing requirements 
see conservative liability structure below for a further discussion of how we fund our subsidiaries 

table of contents certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress 
accordingly  we generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments 
the table below sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments as of november in millions mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities bank loans high yield securities emerging market debt securities private equity and real estate fund investments emerging market equity securities icbc ordinary shares smfg convertible preferred stock other restricted public equity securities other investments in funds excludes billion of mortgage whole loans that were transferred to securitization vehicles where such transfers were accounted for as secured financings rather than sales under sfas no 
we distributed to investors the securities that were issued by the securitization vehicles and therefore do not bear economic exposure to the underlying mortgage whole loans 
includes funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary trading activities 
includes interests in our merchant banking funds 
such amounts exclude assets related to consolidated investment funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  for which goldman sachs does not bear economic exposure 
includes interests of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
includes interests in other investment funds that we manage 
a large portion of these assets are funded through secured funding markets or nonrecourse financing 
we focus on demonstrating a consistent ability to fund these assets on a secured basis for extended periods of time to reduce refinancing risk and to help ensure that they have an established amount of loan value in order that they can be funded in periods of market stress 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold 

table of contents conservative liability structure we seek to structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce refinancing risk and the risk that we may redeem or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity 
our conservative liability structure reflects the following policies we fund a substantial portion of our inventory on a secured basis 
we believe secured financing provides goldman sachs with a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured financing  as it is less sensitive to changes in our credit due to the underlying collateral 
our liquidity depends to an important degree on the stability of our short term unsecured financing base 
accordingly  we prefer the use of promissory notes in which goldman sachs does not make a market over commercial paper  which we may repurchase prior to maturity through the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
as of november and november  our unsecured short term borrowings  including the current portion of unsecured long term borrowings  were billion and billion  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our unsecured short term borrowings 
we recognize that secured funding transactions have greater refinancing risk when the underlying collateral is more difficult to fund 
consequently  we seek longer maturities for secured funding transactions collateralized by these assets 
in some cases  we use extendible maturity features to obtain a rolling minimum term to the funding 
we issue substantially all of our unsecured debt without provisions that would  based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows or stock price  trigger a requirement for an early payment  collateral support  change in terms  acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding 
we make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets  as well as other secured funding markets 
in addition  we issue debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other bond offerings  us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances  and other methods 
we also arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf 
we benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own sales force to a large  diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
our creditors include banks  governments  securities lenders  pension funds  insurance companies and mutual funds 
we access funding in a variety of markets in the americas  europe and asia 
we have imposed various internal guidelines on investor concentration  including the amount of our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors 

table of contents to mitigate refinancing risk  we have created internal guidelines on the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year 
the following table sets forth our quarterly unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile through unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile in millions maturity profile bar chart the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long term borrowings as of november was approximately seven years 
we swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into us dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements 
for a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to access the capital markets  see certain risk factors that may affect our business above as well as risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
subsidiary funding policies 
substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company  group inc the parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing and capital requirements 
in addition  the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an assumption that  unless legally provided for  funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
as such  we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries 
in addition  we assume that the global core excess held in our principal non us operating entities will not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities 

table of contents we also manage our liquidity risk by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company 
this policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent company s third party borrowings 
in addition  many of our subsidiaries and affiliates maintain unencumbered assets to cover their intercompany borrowings other than subordinated debt in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries  for example  as of november  group inc had billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in goldman  sachs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs international  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a us registered broker dealer  and billion invested in goldman sachs japan co  ltd  a regulated japanese broker dealer 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of november  as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
crisis planning in order to be prepared for a liquidity event  or a period of market stress  we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario assumptions 
our planning incorporates several market based and operational stress scenarios 
we also periodically conduct liquidity crisis drills to test our lines of communication and backup funding procedures 
in addition  we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event 
the plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on goldman sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on the severity of the event 
it also lists the crisis management team and internal and external parties to be contacted to ensure effective distribution of information 
credit ratings we rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings 
credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions  including otc derivatives 
we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance and the external operating environment 
see certain risk factors that may affect our business above for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings 
the following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings as of november short term debt long term debt subordinated debt preferred stock dominion bond rating service limited r middle aa low a high a fitch  inc f aa a a moody s investors service p aa a a standard poor s a aa a a rating and investment information  inc a aa not applicable not applicable 
table of contents as of november  collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately million would have been required in the event of a one notch reduction in our long term credit ratings 
in evaluating our liquidity requirements  we consider additional collateral or termination payments that would be required in the event of a two notch downgrade in our long term credit ratings  as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and  consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our business 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing and investing activities  primarily through the issuance of unsecured borrowings  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
we used net cash of billion in our operating activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents decreased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term borrowings as well as through secured financings  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves 
operational risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes  people or systems  or from external events 
operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents related to  for example  major systems failures 
operational risk may also cause reputational harm 
thus  efforts to identify  manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss 
we manage operational risk through the application of long standing  but continuously evolving  firmwide control standards which are supported by the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks across goldman sachs  and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis 
together  these elements form a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize operational risk exposure 
the operational risk department  an independent risk management function  is responsible for developing and implementing a standardized framework to identify  measure  monitor  and report operational risks to support active risk management across goldman sachs 
this framework  which evolves with the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance  incorporates analysis of internal and external operational risk events  business environment and internal control factors  and scenario analysis 
the framework also provides regular reporting of our operational risk exposures to our board  risk committees and senior management
