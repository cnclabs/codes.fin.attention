item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial statements  including a brief discussion of our business and products  key factors that impacted our performance  and a summary of our operating results 
this executive summary should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this item  risk factors in item a and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report 
overview of our business and products we are a manufacturer of semiconductor materials and devices primarily based on sic  gan and related compounds 
we currently focus our expertise in sic and gan on led products  which consist of led chips  led components and led lighting solutions 
we also develop power and rf products  including power switching and rf devices 
we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our led products 
we also generate revenue from sales of sic and gan materials  including gemstone materials  and we earn revenue under government contracts that support some of our research and development programs to the extent the contract funding exceeds our direct cost of performing those activities 
we generate revenues from the following product lines led products 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of our led products 
our led products consist of our led chips  led components  including our xlamp led components and high brightness led components  and led lighting solutions 
materials products 
these products include our sic and gan wafers  which are used in manufacturing leds  rf and microwave devices  power devices and for research and development 
they also include sic material in bulk crystal form  which is used in gemstone applications 
power and rf products 
these products include power switching devices made from sic  which provide faster switching speeds than comparable silicon based power devices  and also include rf devices made from sic or gan  which allow for higher power densities as compared to silicon or gallium arsenide 
contracts with government agencies 
government agencies provide us with funding to support the development of primarily sic and gan based new technology 
the majority of our products historically have been manufactured at our main production facilities in north carolina 
we also have been increasingly utilizing our facility in huizhou  china for the manufacture of certain of our led components and use contract manufacturers in asia for certain aspects of our manufacturing process 
operating segments we currently operate our business as one reportable segment 
in fiscal  we operated our business in two reportable segments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of the cree microwave segment  our silicon based rf and microwave semiconductor business located in sunnyvale  california 
effective december   we reported cree microwave as a discontinued operation 
for further information about this business closure  see note  discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
industry dynamics our business is primarily focused on selling our led products 
leds are currently used to provide energy efficient lighting in the automotive  mobile phone  liquid crystal display lcd backlighting  gaming  signals  
table of contents indoor and outdoor illumination and video screen markets 
led lighting products are in the initial stages of introduction to the general illumination market 
as led technology continues to develop and improve  the potential market for led lighting applications is expanding 
select industry factors affecting our business include  among others overall demand for products and applications using leds 
led lighting is a developing technology especially as it concerns the general illumination market 
the pace of adoption of led lighting technology in the general illumination market and others will impact the demand for leds 
intense and constantly evolving competitive environment 
competition in the industry is intense 
product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share 
to remain competitive  market participants generally must increase product performance and reduce costs to support lower average sales prices 
intellectual property issues 
market participants rely on patented and non patented proprietary information relating to product development  manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business 
protection of intellectual property is critical 
as such  steps such as additional patent applications  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements  as well as other security measures are generally taken 
to enforce or protect intellectual property rights  litigation or threatened litigation commonly occurs 
fiscal highlights the following is a summary of key financial results and certain non financial results achieved for the year ended june  our revenues from continuing operations for the year increased to million 
we experienced strong sales growth in our led products  which increased million or from the prior year 
revenues from the sale of our led components increased substantially from the prior year  more than offsetting a decline in revenues attributable to sales of our led chips 
revenues from the sales of our led components represented approximately half of our total revenues from led products in fiscal our gross margin was similar to the prior year at of revenue  reflecting the continued investment in new product introductions and a competitive environment for our led chips 
we achieved consolidated net income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we generated positive cash flow from operations of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal combined cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments increased million or to million at june  compared to million at june  we purchased and retired nearly two million outstanding shares of our common stock 
we made significant progress in the integration of cotco into our business 
we initiated the transition of our production process from a three inch to four inch wafer 
this transition is targeted to improve our chip yield per wafer and consequently lower our cost per chip 
on february   we closed the acquisition of llf 
through this acquisition we acquired what we believe to be key technologies to drive retrofit solutions to convert existing lighting infrastructure to energy efficient lighting and to accelerate the adoption of led lighting into the general illumination market 

table of contents business outlook we project that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal we anticipate focusing on the following key areas  among others  in response to this competitive environment continue efforts to enable led lighting 
we plan to continue to invest in and support initiatives that we believe will enable and potentially accelerate the adoption of led lighting in the general illumination market 
we believe these efforts can ultimately help to increase the demand for our led products 
invest in technology  product development and infrastructure 
we plan to continue enhancing our existing products  developing new products and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property through significant investments in research and development 
in addition  to support unit volume growth and to meet anticipated capacity needs in our asian operations  we target investing no less in capital expenditures in fiscal than we have on average in recent history 
expand our global sales and distribution channels 
we intend to continue to expand our global direct sales force  agents  partnerships and distributor relationships 
continue focus on operating improvements 
we continue focusing on identifying new ways to improve our operating efficiency and processes in all facets of our operations  including those outside of manufacturing  to maintain and improve our profitability 
this includes shifting production to our lower cost manufacturing facility in huizhou  china or contract manufacturers in asia  leveraging investments in information technology  constant monitoring and adjustment of our working capital to fluctuations in our business  robust budgeting and planning processes and continuing efforts to streamline our processes and procedures to properly manage operating expenses 
continue to focus on growing our power and rf product revenue 
we have had success in winning new designs in certain volume applications  yet we still have a limited number of customers 
our goal over the next year is to begin to realize more of the potential of power and rf products by expanding sales to a broader customer base  which should provide the increased volume needed to reduce costs and improve margins on these products 
evaluate strategic opportunities 
we intend to continue to evaluate and potentially pursue appropriate strategic opportunities such as technology licensing arrangements  acquisitions  partnerships or joint ventures that complement or expand our existing business

overall declines in blended average selling prices were offset by lower costs per unit 
gross margin from continuing operations in fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal our gross margin percentage decreased from to of revenue caused primarily by lower margins on sales of led chips as average selling prices declined faster than product costs  higher costs related to our new led component products and lower factory utilization 
contract gross margins were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin percentage related to contracts will fluctuate year to year based upon the mix of active contracts between cost share versus for profit research arrangements  and mix of work actually performed on those contracts in any given year

table of contents sales  general and administrative expenses  from continuing operations increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in costs in fiscal is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of the acquired operations of cotco in fiscal as opposed to only one quarter in fiscal and increased spending on sales and marketing 
additionally  costs increased due to the general expansion of our business  increased employee compensation costs  including costs related to salaries  stock based compensation and higher costs related to certain patent litigation 
in fiscal  sales  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase primarily related to increased costs incurred in connection with patent litigation  increased spending on sales and marketing to support our new product lines and additional expenses related to our acquisitions of intrinsic and cotco 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded various intangible assets including customer relationships and developed technologies 
amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions is as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to intrinsic cotco llf total amortization of acquisition related intangibles from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is due primarily to an increase in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal resulting from our acquisition of cotco in fiscal during fiscal  we acquired intrinsic and cotco  resulting in million of amortizable intangible assets principally composed of customer relationships and developed technology 
in fiscal  we acquired llf  resulting in an additional million of amortizable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were principally composed of developed technology  that specifically relates to technologies underlying the development of led lighting products for the general illumination market 
loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets we operate a capital intensive business 
as such  we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change whether due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes 
due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process  we regularly review our equipment for possible impairments in value 
the following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets we recorded a net loss of million on the disposal of long lived assets in fiscal consistent with the net loss recognized in fiscal the fiscal loss was composed of losses due to the impairment of certain equipment  the impairment of capitalized patent costs and losses on the disposal of equipment 
the decrease in losses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a one time million write off in fiscal of building improvement and computer software that were no longer being used at our durham  north carolina facility 

table of contents gain on sale of investments  net the following table sets forth our gain on sale of investments  net in dollars in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to gain on sale of investments  net the gain on sale of investments was million in fiscal compared to a gain of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these gains principally relate to the sale of our holdings of color kinetics incorporated color kinetics common stock over the respective three fiscal years 
during fiscal  and  we sold  shares   shares  and  shares of color kinetics common stock  respectively 
as of june  we have fully liquidated our holdings in color kinetics 
interest income  net we have historically invested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities  and other fixed interest rate investments 
the primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal while maximizing our yields 
the following table sets forth our interest income in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to interest income  net net interest income was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  investment income was largely consistent with fiscal as higher average investment balances offset declining interest rates earned on our fixed rate securities and cash and cash equivalent holdings 
in fiscal  investment income increased to million from million in fiscal largely due to higher interest rates received on our fixed rate securities 
for a discussion of certain risks related to our investment holdings  see the section entitled financial and market risks that is included in this item as well as the discussion of risks pertaining to our investments included in item a risk factors of this annual report 
income tax expense the following table sets forth our income tax expense in dollars and our effective tax rate from continuing operations in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income tax expense effective tax rate on continuing operations we recorded income tax expense of million from continuing operations in fiscal as compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the change is primarily due to certain discrete tax events in fiscal  including the release of contingent tax reserves  the resolution of internal revenue service audits of our fiscal  and federal tax returns and the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to federal capital loss carryforwards 

table of contents income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in fiscal  we discontinued the operations of our cree microwave subsidiary 
the following table sets forth our income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax during fiscal  we recorded after tax income of million from our discontinued operations compared to after tax income of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal in fiscal we recorded our estimate of the expected losses from the closure of our cree microwave business 
in fiscal  the primary driver of the after tax income was the release of contingent tax reserves relating to our former cree microwave business as a result of the completion of internal revenue service audits of fiscal  and in the amount of million  which was partially offset by continued expenses arising from the sunnyvale facility operating lease 
in fiscal  the income was due primarily to our sale of certain patents associated with our cree microwave business that resulted in a net gain of million  which was then offset by continued expenses arising from the sunnyvale facility operating lease 
liquidity and capital resources overview we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  and to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  marketable investments and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating  financing and investing needs 
we have no debt or lines of credit and have minimal lease commitments 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations  and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities and potential investments in complementary businesses and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
we may also issue debt  additional shares of common stock  or use available cash on hand for the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities 
contractual obligations at june   payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations cotco contingent consideration other long term liabilities total 
table of contents operating leases include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non cancelable operating leases 
these leases expire at various times through december all of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent up to specific limits  property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recorded as rent expense  if applicable 
purchase obligations generally relate to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials  supplies and capital equipment 
our purchase obligations represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
as the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition achieved certain defined ebitda targets for the year ended june   we are contractually obligated to make a payment in the amount of million to the former shareholder of cotco or its designees in fiscal  which we elected to pay in cash 
if certain defined ebitda targets are met by the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition in fiscal  an additional contingent payment of up to million may be due to the former shareholder 
this additional contingent payment may be settled in cash or common stock at our option  subject to certain limitations 
as part of the acquisition of llf  additional consideration of up to million may be payable to the former shareholders of llf if defined product development targets and key employee retention measures are achieved over our next three fiscal years 
these product development targets may or may not be met 
financial condition our liquidity and capital resources depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital 
our working capital increased to million as of june  from million at june   primarily due to positive cash flows from operations and cash generated through the exercise of employee stock options 
at june   our inventory days on hand  calculated on an annual basis  were as compared to days at june  the decrease in inventory days reflects our efforts to integrate the operations and product lines acquired through our acquisition of cotco 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding  calculated on an annual basis  were days at june  as compared to days at june  accounts receivable days increased as we had a greater percentage of our sales fall later in the fourth fiscal quarter in fiscal as compared to fiscal and a shift in sales mix to customers who have generally longer payment terms or practices 
with our strong working capital position  we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and  when necessary or appropriate  make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio or secure key intellectual properties 
the significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by trade accounts payable  accrued salaries and wages and other current liabilities 
we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations in fiscal  and during fiscal  as a result of a strategic change in the use of invested funds  changes in market factors surrounding certain underlying securities and consideration of the current conditions in the capital markets  we determined that we would make our complete portfolio of marketable securities available for current operations 
as a result of this determination  investments with amortized cost of million were transferred from held to maturity to available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are required to be carried at fair value  which resulted in a net increase in the carrying value of these investments of million with a corresponding increase in accumulated other comprehensive income net of the related tax effects 
from this point forward  our investments in marketable securities will be accounted for at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income net of the related tax effects 
as of june   substantially all of our investments had investment grade ratings  and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at june  were in such position due to interest rate 
table of contents changes  sector credit rating changes or company specific rating changes 
as we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value  we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities 
when evaluating our investments for possible impairment  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below our cost basis  the financial condition of the entity in which the investment is made  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
the declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and  accordingly  we do not believe these securities are impaired as of june  we believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we have and may continue to use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents  or funds underlying our marketable securities  to repurchase shares of our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to operate a cash positive business in fiscal cash flows as discussed above  one of the primary sources of our liquidity is our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations 
the following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities decreased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of lower net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities  such as an increase in accounts and interest receivable as opposed to a decrease in fiscal cash provided by operating activities decreased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of lower net income adjusted for a million gain on sales of investments and changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily an increase in inventories 
during fiscal   and  our cash flows from operations were primarily derived from earnings from operations prior to non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  gains realized on the sale of investments and deferred income tax income or expense  and changes in our working capital  which is primarily composed of accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by changes in current expenses such as accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash flows from investing activities in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
our investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our 
table of contents investments  strategic acquisitions  purchase of property  plant and equipment and purchase of patent and or license rights 
cash provided by investing activities increased on a year over year basis during fiscal primarily as a result of increased cash generated from the maturity of our fixed income investments offset by reinvestment amounts  lower capital expenditures and less cash spent on strategic acquisitions 
cash used in financing activities decreased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of a higher rate of investment in investment securities than maturities 
acquisition related cash outflows were million in fiscal  relating to the cash consideration component of our acquisition of llf  and million in fiscal  relating to the cash consideration components of our acquisitions of intrinsic and cotco 
see note  acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these acquisitions 
our investment in new property and equipment amounted to million  million and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
capital expenditures increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal due to spending on major plant initiatives  which increased in fiscal but then decreased in fiscal as the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition achieved certain defined ebitda targets for the year ended june   we are contractually obligated to make a payment in the amount of million to the former shareholder of cotco or its designees in fiscal  which we elected to pay in cash 
this additional payment is reflected as a current obligation and increase to goodwill in our consolidated financial statements 
if certain defined ebitda targets are met by the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition in fiscal  an additional contingent payment of up to million may be due to the former shareholder 
this additional contingent payment may be settled in cash or common stock at our option  subject to certain limitations 
if this remaining contingent payment were to occur  it would result in an increase to purchased goodwill 
as part of the acquisition of llf  additional consideration of up to million may be payable to the former shareholders of llf if defined product development targets and key employee retention measures are achieved over our next three fiscal years 
these product development targets may or may not be met but if such contingent payments occur  these will be considered as additional purchase price and result in an increase in goodwill 
we will continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures  while making strategic investments to develop our existing products  pursue strategic initiatives where appropriate and invest in our manufacturing and information technology infrastructure to meet the needs of our business 
we target investing no less in capital expenditures in fiscal than we have on average in recent history 
cash flows from financing activities in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our cash flows from financing activities are principally composed of cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases offset by cash outflows related to our repurchase of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of higher net proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by our spending on the repurchase of common stock 
cash used in financing increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to higher spending on the repurchase of common stock than cash proceeds received from the issuance of common stock 

table of contents as of june   there remained approximately million shares of our common stock approved for repurchase under the repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
since the inception of our stock repurchase program  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
at the discretion of our management  the repurchase program can be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions 
we will determine the time and extent of repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
financial and market risks we are exposed to financial and market risks  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and investment risk 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks  however  we may choose to do so in the future 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at june  and june  actual results may differ materially 
interest rates we maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities  and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
in order to minimize risk  we only acquire investments rated a grade or better in accordance with our cash management policy 
at june   we had million invested in these securities  compared to million at june  although these securities generally earn interest at fixed rates  the historical fair values of such investments have not differed materially from the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market price was approximately million at june  and million at june  currency exchange rates as we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
additionally  certain of our foreign subsidiaries operate with a functional currency other than the us dollar  our reporting currency 
this requires that results of these foreign operations be translated at average exchange rates into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities 
our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between the us dollar  the chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 
investment risk we have made and may make future investments in public or privately held companies having operations or technologies in areas within our strategic focus 
these investments may be marketable in the case of investments in the common stock of other publicly traded companies or potentially non marketable in certain instances with investments in privately held companies 
whether marketable or non marketable  investments can be inherently risky as markets for the technologies or products of these companies may be in the early stages of development and may never materialize 
as of june   we held a long term investment in the equity securities of color kinetics  which was treated for accounting purposes as an investment in available for sale securities 
as such  this investment was carried at fair market value based upon the quoted market price of the stock  with any net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
during  we fully liquidated our investments in the common stock of color kinetics 
we received proceeds of million and recognized a pre tax gain of million from the sale during the period 
as of june   we have no significant investments in individual public or privately held companies 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our us and international facilities in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of june  are detailed above in liquidity and capital resources in the section entitled contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
in the application of us gaap we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates 
in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  recoverability of long lived assets  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  tax contingencies  valuation of inventories  contingent liabilities  and accruals for other liabilities  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with us gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require a high degree of management judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates  each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and product warranty claims 
in addition  certain of our sales arrangements provide for limited product exchanges and the potential for reimbursement of certain sales costs 
as a result  we record an allowance  which is recorded as a reduction of product revenue in the consolidated statements of income and as a reduction to accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate our allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
specifically  we 
table of contents review historical sales returns and other relevant data and match returns or other credits to the quarter when the sales were originally recorded 
based on historical return percentages and other relevant factors  we estimate our potential future exposure on recorded product sales 
the allowance for sales returns at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  we also record an asset for the estimated value of these product returns that we believe will be returned to inventory and resold 
as of june  and june   we estimated the cost of future product returns at million and million  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for awards of stock based compensation under our employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as prescribed by sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
accordingly  we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards we currently use the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
due to the inherent limitations of option valuation models available today  including future events that are unpredictable and the estimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the stock based awards  the ultimate value realized by award holders may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in our financial statements 
for restricted stock awards  grant date fair value is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
this fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
sfas r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
our determination of an estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based upon a review of historical experience but may also include consideration of other facts and circumstances we believe are indicative of future activity 
the assessment of an estimated forfeiture rate will not alter the total compensation expense to be recognized  only the timing of this recognition as compensation expense is adjusted to reflect instruments that actually vest 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions  we may be required to adjust compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
recoverability of long lived assets our assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets involves significant judgment and estimation 
factors that may require estimates when performing recoverability and impairment tests include  among others  the economic life of the asset  sales volumes  prices  cost of capital  tax rates and capital spending 
these factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 
we may also use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that may indicate potential impairment 
testing is performed at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment analysis is performed 
the second step is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
table of contents with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
however  it should be noted that the loss recognized shall not be in excess of the carrying amount 
once a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying value shall be its new accounting basis 
we evaluate certain other long lived assets such as property  equipment and definite lived intangible assets such as patents for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recorded in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  we first determine if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset being evaluated 
if so  an impairment loss is measured and recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset being tested exceeds its fair value 
we may use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of assets in these cases  including cash flow analyses and appraisals 
if future results are not consistent with our current assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be required to record additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
we do not restore a previously recognized impairment loss if the asset s carrying value decreases below its estimated fair value 
we recorded million  million and million of long lived asset impairment charges during the fiscal years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances we have established a valuation allowance for capital loss carryforwards where we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the items will not be realized due to insufficient availability of capital gains in the carryforward period 
in addition  we have established a valuation allowance related to state income tax credits recorded on the financial statements during the year for which we believe we will have insufficient state taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize the losses 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors  including historical and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
when we establish or increase a valuation allowance  our income tax expense increases in the period such determination is made 
if we decrease a valuation allowance  our income tax expense decreases in the period such determination is made 
tax contingencies we are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal  state and local agencies 
the audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 we evaluate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
fin states that a tax benefit should not be recognized for financial statement purposes for an uncertain tax filing position where it is not more likely than not likelihood of greater than to be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
in accordance with the provisions of fin  we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to the deferred tax asset or as an increase to the fin liability account included in other liabilities to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain  we presume the tax position will 
table of contents be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fully resolved 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which we have recorded an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recorded  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand 
in particular  we fully reserve for all inventory greater than months old  unless there is an identified need for the inventory 
we also analyze sales levels by product type  including historical and future estimated customer demand for those products to determine if any additional reserves are appropriate 
for example  we take reserve for items that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes or new product introductions that may eliminate demand for the product 
if our estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate  or market conditions and technology change in ways that are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
contingent liabilities we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
in accordance with sfas  a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as defined by sfas  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and whether such loss is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable  we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability  opinions of legal counsel and recent legal rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies  among other factors 
as additional information becomes available  we reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see also a discussion of specific contingencies in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 

table of contents accruals for other liabilities we make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for our self funded medical insurance and general services  including legal fees  accounting fees and other expenses 
our liabilities contain uncertainties because we must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating our liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including interviewing our service providers for bills that have not yet been received 
for self insured liabilities  we estimate our liabilities based on historical claims experience 
if actual costs billed to us are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  our expenses could be understated or overstated and these adjustments could materially affect our net income
