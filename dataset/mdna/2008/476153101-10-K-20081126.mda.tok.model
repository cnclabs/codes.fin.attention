all obligations of the related company and the unconsolidated licensees due as of august   were paid based on the payment terms of days from end of month 
however  at any given time  the related company owes us approximately million for the services and goods we provide to it 
we assume that like other retailers and us  the related company has been adversely affected by the economy 
if the related company were unable to pay the amounts due to us  it would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
the related company also provides fabric protection services to our jennifer segment customers and  if the related company were unable to provide such services  we would have to find an alternative provider in order to sell those services to our customers in the future and would  as a matter of customer relations  likely have to pay for such provider to supply services with respect to previously sold fabric protection services 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement and a security agreement the security agreement with caye home furnishings  llc agent  caye upholstery  llc and caye international furnishings  llc collectively  caye 
under the credit agreement  caye agrees to make available to us a credit facility the caye credit facility of up to million  effectively extending caye s payment terms for merchandise shipped to us from days to days after receipt of goods 
the amount available under this facility may be reduced in the event that we do not maintain a specified level of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and cash in deposit accounts 
we must pay each extension of credit under the credit agreement within days after receipt of goods 
for the period between and days after receipt of goods  the annual interest rate will be the prime rate plus 
if the borrowings are not repaid after days the interest rate increases to prime plus 
on april   we amended the credit agreement 
under the amendment to the credit agreement  caye agreed to increase the caye credit facility from million to million 
the credit agreement contains various negative covenants restricting our ability to enter into a merger or sale  make guarantees  pay dividends to common stockholders  incur debt or take other actions  without the consent of the agent 
in addition  the credit agreement provides for the following a fixed charge coverage ratio  a cross default with certain other of our debt  appraisal rights  periodic reporting requirements  and other customary terms 
we may terminate the credit agreement at any time  so long as all outstanding amounts have been paid in full 
we may also terminate the credit agreement if we have i maintained a tangible net worth of at least million for days and ii adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of at least million for four fiscal quarters 
pursuant to the security agreement  so long as amounts are outstanding under the credit agreement  caye will have a first priority security interest in all of our assets and properties  including inventory  accounts receivable and equipment  as well as a license to our intellectual property in the event of a default 
on october   we entered into the second amendment to the credit agreement and first amendment to security agreement with caye  pursuant to which such agreements were amended to permit us to open and operate several licensed ashley furniture homestores in new york 
on july  we entered into the third amendment to the credit agreement and second amendment to security agreement with caye  pursuant to which such agreements were amended to increase the caye credit facility from million to million and reduce the amount we are required by us to maintain in the deposit account to a balance no less at all times from million to million in the restricted deposit account 
on april   the company entered into the fourth amendment to the credit agreement and third amendment to security agreement to expand the scope of the caye credit facility to include ashley stores in additional new york metropolitan areas and increase the amount of capital expenditures allowable in certain new york metropolitan areas 
as of august   we owed caye approximately  no portion of which exceeded the day payment terms 
we have obtained a waiver expiring on august   for breach of the fixed charge coverage ratio in the credit agreement with caye 
based on current economic conditions it is uncertain we will be in compliance when the waiver expires 
if caye does not extend the waiver  caye will be entitled to stop supplying us credit and to accelarate all amounts currently due to caye 
caye has advised us that  as a result of current economic conditions and conditions in the credit market  it may substantially decrease the amount of inventory it supplies us 
caye has indicated that it expects to continue to supply us at least through the end of march but it is uncertain whether it will continue after such date to take orders from us  except for orders from its domestic factories  which represent approximately of our business with caye 
given the time lag between the taking of orders and delivery  that means that after june  we may need to get substantially all of our inventory from other sources 
the chinese company which currently manufactures approximately of what we order through caye  has given us a letter agreement to the effect that if caye stops supplying us prior to november   it will  for at least a year thereafter  supply us with goods and provide us days to pay for those goods without interest or penalty and an additional days grace period on amounts over days at a per annum rate of over prime  provided that in no event will the amount payable by us exceed million 
this arrangement is substantially the same as our current arrangement with caye except that under the caye agreement we can owe up to million 
settlement agreements between us and the related company impact our liquidity  capital resources and operations in a number of ways as more fully discussed under certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
the transactions with the related company  including our assumption of the warehousing responsibilities  adversely affected our operating results by  in fiscal and improved our operating results by  in fiscal and  in fiscal  compared to the results we would have achieved based on the same sales levels under the agreements effective prior to the initial operating agreement as more fully described under the caption certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
on november   we entered into a fifth amendment to the warehousing agreement with the related company which provides that effective january  the warehousing fee will be raised from to on the net sales price of goods sold by the related company for a one year period 
based on related company delivered sales during the fiscal month end of january to the fiscal month end of august  this change would have equated to an additional  of income during our fiscal year ended august  we are assuming  however  that the related company s sales  like ours  may be lower than last year due to current economic conditions and  therefore  the benefit for the fiscal year ending august  may be less than on november   we entered into a fifth amendment to the management agreement and license  pursuant to which the related company also agreed  for a one year period commencing january  to increase its advertising contribution from  per month to  per month  an increase of  per year  and to contribute an additional  in three monthly installments of  beginning on january   for a planned television advertising campaign 
in addition  we eliminated the reductions to the related company s share of the advertising costs  which reductions were tied to shortfalls in the related company s net delivered sales 
the credit card companies have  for the past several years  paid us shortly after credit card purchases by our customers 
however  they have indicated to us that in light of current economic and credit conditions they are reexamining their payment policies 
extensions of the time they take to pay us would adversely affect our cash flow 
in this connection  we have entered into an agreement with one of our credit card companies for the interim period ending december   pursuant to which there will be a  reserve established as  in effect  a performance bond against delivery by us of the merchandise ordered by their credit card customers 
based on the current level of operations at our stores  and after giving effect to cost cutting programs we intend to implement  and the recently amended arrangements with the related company described above  we anticipate that we will have the capital resources to operate for at least the next months 
however  if current economic and credit conditions prevail beyond the next year or worsen  there would be significant doubt as whether we could continue to operate significantly beyond that time without an infusion of capital or other measures  the availability of which there can be no assurance 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations in total  for each of the next five years and thereafter  as of august  such obligations include the retail store and warehouse leases  the lease for the executive office  written employment contracts for two of our executive officers  and agreements to pay the related company royalties 
dollars in thousands thereafter total operating leases for retail stores  warehouses and executive office    capital leases for equipment royalty payments to the related company   employment contracts fabric protection fees to the related company total contractual obligations     the obligation to make these payments terminates on the earliest of i the closing of the asset acquisition following an exercise by us of our option to purchase substantially all of the assets of the related company under the option agreement  ii april   unless the parties extend the license term  in which case the date shall be december   iii the termination of manager s role as manager under the agreement  or iv on such date as is determined by an arbitrator or a court 
for purposes of calculating the amount we have assumed the license will run out on april  for the fiscal years ended august  and august  we had  and  respectively  in capital expenditures from continuing operations 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal to open a third ashley homestore and to refurbish existing facilities 
we do not anticipate needing outside financing for such capital expenditures
