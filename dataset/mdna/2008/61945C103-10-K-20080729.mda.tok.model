item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our strong cash flows during fiscal and the latter part of fiscal allowed us to prepay billion in debt from may  through december   achieving our goal of reducing our long term debt and marking a key milestone toward our goal of obtaining an investment grade credit rating 
during the remainder of fiscal  our cash flows allowed us to accumulate significant cash and we were able to eliminate a restriction on capital expenditures from our debt covenants  which should help enable us to grow our businesses in the future 
by early june  two of three credit rating agencies  fitch inc and standard and poor s ratings services  that rate our senior notes due and senior notes due the new senior notes had upgraded their ratings of the new senior notes and other unsecured debt to investment grade status 
as a result  most of the restrictive covenants relating to the new senior notes have fallen away 
certain restrictive covenants of the senior notes  as well as the restrictive covenants under our senior secured bank credit facility  continue to apply 
we have included additional information about our debt reduction  cash flows  capital resources and liquidity  and debt covenants in note of our consolidated financial statements and in our management s analysis

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
although a security rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  any such revision or withdrawal would not affect the fall away of the covenants relating to the senior notes 
each rating should be evaluated separately from any other rating
