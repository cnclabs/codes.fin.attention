item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview headquartered in sunnyvale  california  we are a leader in semiconductors for the secure storage  distribution and presentation of high definition content 
we are dedicated to the promotion of technologies  standards and products that facilitate the movement of digital content between and among digital devices across the consumer electronics ce  personal computer pc and storage spaces 
we have shipped more than million hdmi compliant chips to date 
we are the leading provider of semiconductor intellectual property solutions for high definition multimedia and data storage applications 
silicon image s hdmi products have been selected by many of the world s leading ce companies 
our products have driven the transition to industry leading hdmi products with features including deep color tm and lossless hd audio 
in the pc market  we continue to be a leader in the dvi market 
the growth of digital tvs with hdmi inputs provides a source of demand for our pc products as consumers increasingly seek to connect their pcs to their dtvs to play games  watch high definition dvds and view photos 
because hdmi is backwards compatible with the dvi standard  hdmi enabled pcs can also connect directly to the enormous installed base of pc monitors with dvi inputs 
we believe the consumer trend of increasingly purchasing and downloading content eg music  tv programs and movies from the internet will create a growing awareness and need for low cost  simple  secure and reliable storage 
in  we released our second generation storage processors compatible with sata  external sata esata and universal serial bus usb hosts 
in addition  we offer one of the most robust and comprehensively tested technology platforms in the consumer electronics industry through our simplay labs simplay hd tm testing program 
simplay labs  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of silicon image  is a leading provider of testing technologies  tools and services for high definition consumer electronics devices such as hdtvs  set top boxes  a v receivers and dvd players  helping manufacturers to achieve compatibility and deliver the highest quality hdtv experience to consumers 
we completed two important transactions in that enhance our ability to offer higher levels of integration and greater price performance value to our customers 
we entered into a cross license agreement with sunplus technology company  ltd 
for advanced ip to use in dtv semiconductor products  which we believe will offer us greater opportunities to develop semiconductor solutions for the home and mobile device environment 
the license agreement provides for the payment of an aggregate of million to sunplus by silicon image  million of which is payable in consideration for the licensed technology and related deliverables and million of which is payable in consideration for sunplus support and maintenance obligations 
as of december   we had paid approximately million towards the million obligation 
in addition  while we are still validating the technology received from sunplus  we began to integrate a portion of this technology into a new product development project 
as a result  we began to amortize the million in the fourth quarter of in addition  our acquisition of sci worx gmbh sci worx  now silicon image  germany provides us a combination of additional advanced ip and a highly skilled pool of engineers who will help leverage our research and development efforts into new products 
we acquired sci worx gmbh for a net cash consideration of million 
during  the company completed the integration of the sci worx engineers and began utilizing this resource to drive development of existing and newly created product development projects 
we believe that the intellectual property licensed from sunplus  along with the engineering talent and intellectual property acquired in the sci worx transaction  will enhance our ability to continue to develop a broader array of product offerings 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the accounting policies discussed in our notes to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy complies with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and rights of return  is generally recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer which typically occurs upon shipment 
reserves for sales returns are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
for products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns  we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer 
our estimate of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
pursuant to our distributor agreements  older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
for these products  revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue for includes approximately million of product revenue and cost of revenue includes approximately million related to distributor sales for the month of december historically  the company had deferred the recognition of sell through revenue from distributor sales for the third month of a quarter until the following quarter due to the unavailability of reliable sell through information in a timely manner 
as a result of improved business processes  the company was able to eliminate this delay beginning with the fourth quarter of  resulting in fiscal year revenue including an additional month of product revenue from distributor sales in december this one time effect of the inclusion of an additional month of revenue for fiscal year is an increase to net income by approximately million and an increase to net income per share  basic and diluted  by approximately at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred margin on sale to distributors  a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred margin on the sale to distributor effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor 
however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sale to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions 
we sell each item in our product price book to all of our distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer  product  quantity  geography  competitive pricing and other factors 
the majority of our distributors resale are priced at a discount from list price 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed 
thus  a portion of the deferred margin on the sale to distributor balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future 
the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred margin on the sale to distributor that will be remitted back to the distributors 
we reduce deferred margin by anticipated or determinable future price concessions 
we derive revenue from license of our internally developed intellectual property ip 
we enter into ip licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
revenue earned under contracts with our licensees is classified as development  licensing and royalties 
our license fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and for 
table of contents multiple deliverable arrangements we follow the guidance in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method  if objective and reliable evidence of fair value does not exist for delivered elements 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
the ip licensing agreements generally include a nonexclusive license for the underlying ip 
fees under these agreements generally include a license fees relating to our ip b maintenance and support  typically for one year  and c royalties payable following the sale by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
the license for our ip has standalone value and can be used by the licensee without maintenance and support 
further  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for maintenance and support 
accordingly  license fees and maintenance and support fees are each treated as separate units of accounting 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
for contracts related to licenses of our technology that involve significant modification  customization or engineering services we recognize revenue in accordance the provisions of sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues derived from such license contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we determine progress to completion based on input measures using labor hours incurred by our engineers 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total contract fees and the percentage of completion achieved 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
if there is significant uncertainty about customer acceptance  or the time to complete the development or the deliverables by either party  we consider applying completed contract method 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
stock based compensation prior to  our stock based employee compensation plans were accounted for under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
our employee stock purchase plan espp qualified as a non compensatory plan under apb therefore  no compensation cost was recorded in relation to the discount offered to employees for purchases made under the espp 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 as adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
stock 
table of contents based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to december  was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  our espp is considered a compensatory plan and we are required to recognize compensation cost for grants made under the espp 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis for all share based payment awards over the respective requisite service period of the awards 
for purposes of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we followed the alternative transition method discussed in fasb staff position no 
r transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
cash equivalents and short term investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and fasb staff position  or fsp  sfas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date 
the investments are adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity and such amortization is included in interest income 
we follow the guidance provided by eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the statements of income 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the longer the duration of our investment securities  the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields 
as yields increase  those securities purchased with a lower yield at cost show a mark to market unrealized loss 
all unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields 
we expect to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity or sale 
the classification of our investments into cash equivalents and short term investments is in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
cash equivalents consist of short term  highly liquid financial instruments with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
short term investments consist of taxable commercial paper  united states government agency obligations  corporate municipal notes and bonds with high credit quality and money market preferred stock 
these securities have maturities greater than three months from the date of purchase 
we believe all of the financial instruments recorded values approximate current fair values because of their nature and respective durations 
the fair value of marketable securities is determined using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectability of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer and the reason for the delinquency 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
write offs to date have not been material 
increase in the allowance in as compared to is primarily due to the inclusion of allowance on receivables due to the purchase accounting of sci worx  now silicon image gmbh 
while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 

table of contents inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost  adjusted for variances between standard and actual 
standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs  manufacturing yields  costs to assemble  test and package our products and allocable indirect costs 
we record differences between standard costs and actual costs as variances 
these variances are analyzed and are either included on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statement of income in order to state the inventories at actual costs on a fifo basis 
standard costs are evaluated at least annually 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
once a provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
long lived assets consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to depreciate long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying amount of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows  attributable to such assets 
in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s fair value 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult and requires the use of significant judgment 
we assign the following useful lives to our fixed assets three years for computers and software  one to five years for equipment and five to seven years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life  which ranges from two to five years 
depreciation expense was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and goodwill and intangible assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether impairment may exist 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company has determined based on the criteria of sfas that we have one reporting unit for this purpose 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by comparing our market capitalization as of the date of the impairment testing to the carry amount of equity 
the impairment test for 
table of contents other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased other intangible assets to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
significant assumptions are inherent and highly subjective in this process 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
advertising and research and development advertising and research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
advertising expenses were insignificant in  and it is the company s policy to record a reduction to research and development expense for funding received from outside parties for research and development projects 
during the year ended december   such funding was immaterial 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a reduction to research and development expense totaling approximately million related to funding received from outside parties for one engineering project 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a reduction to research and development expense totaling approximately million related to funding received from outside parties for three engineering projects 
such funding was provided irrespective of the results of the projects 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
deferred tax assets we account for deferred tax assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the first quarter of  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
requires that management determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
for income taxes we use an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
in general  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for valuation allowances 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets  related primarily to stock based compensation  accruals and reserves that are not currently deductible and tax credit carry forwards of million 
at december  our gross deferred tax assets of million consisted primarily of tax credit carryforwards and stock based compensation not currently deductible for tax purposes 
prior to  we had provided a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets 
in  we determined that our net deferred tax assets as of december  were more likely than not to be realized 
therefore  in  we released the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million that had reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as of december  approximately million of the valuation allowance release related to prior years windfall tax benefits on employee stock transactions that were included in the deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of december  this portion of the valuation allowance release was recorded as a direct increase to additional paid in capital instead of a reduction to the tax provision 

table of contents accrued liabilities certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
our estimates are based on historical experience  input from sources outside the company and other relevant facts and circumstances 
guarantees  indemnifications and warranty liabilities certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to the intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
at the time of revenue recognition  we provide an accrual for estimated costs included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to be incurred pursuant to our warranty obligation 
our estimate is based primarily on historical experience 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss accumulated other comprehensive loss of  as of december   was comprised of net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of  and foreign currency translation adjustments of  accumulated other comprehensive loss of  as of december   was comprised of net unrealized losses on available for sale securities of  and foreign currency translation adjustments of 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oem s rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of our revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in microtek comprised  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
innotech corporation  comprised  and of our revenue in  and respectively 
world peace inc  comprised  and of our revenue in  and respectively 
our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are incorporated into flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
recent accounting pronouncements in september   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
this statement also requires expanded disclosures on the inputs used to measure fair value and for recurring fair value measurements using unobservable inputs  which affects the earnings for the period 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  additionally  prospective application of this 
table of contents statement is required as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement but do not expect that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement but do not expect that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas r will significantly change current practices regarding business combinations 
among the more significant changes  sfas r expands the definition of a business and a business combination  requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests including goodwill  measured at fair value at the acquisition date  requires acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination  requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contractual and non contractual contingencies to be recognized at their acquisition date fair values with subsequent changes recognized in earnings  and requires in process research and development to be capitalized at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  reporting them as equity separate from the parent entity s equity  as well as requiring expanded disclosures 
sfas r and sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas r and sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
annual results of operations revenue by product line was as follows in thousands change change dollars in thousands consumer electronics personal computer storage total product revenue percentage of total revenue development  licensing and royalties percentage of total revenue total revenue revenue including development  licensing and royalty revenues collectively  licensing revenue  by product line change change dollars in thousands consumer electronics personal computer storage products total revenue total revenue for was million and represented a sequential growth of over and over revenue for includes approximately million of product revenue and cost of revenue includes approximately million related to distributor sales for the month of december historically  the company 
table of contents had deferred the recognition of sell through revenue from distributor sales for the third month of a quarter until the following quarter due to the unavailability of reliable sell through information in a timely manner 
as a result of improved business processes  the company was able to eliminate this delay beginning with the fourth quarter of  resulting in fiscal year revenue including an additional month of product revenue from distributor sales in december the increase in product revenue in as compared to and was primarily driven by increased unit shipments  recognition of distributor revenue for december  partially offset by declines in average selling prices asp across all product categories 
we currently expect average selling prices to continue to decline for all of our product categories in the first quarter of additionally  we expect to be a product transition year 
as part of this transition we currently expect to sample and subsequently announce a number of design wins throughout we expect volume shipments for the new products to start occurring in the first half of accordingly  we expect our total revenue to decline in total revenue for was million and represented a sequential growth of over driven by increased sales  of our ce products 
the increase in the ce product revenue relative to was due primarily to strong sales volumes of hdmi receivers and transmitters 
the increase in pc product revenue was driven primarily by pc transmitters that incorporate our dvi technology and our intelligent panel controllers  which are key components in lcd displays  partially offset by modest erosion in the average selling prices of products 
revenue from our dvi products are expected to decline in the future as dvi technology is replaced by hdmi and displayport 
the decrease in storage product revenue was due to the trend of declining sales of our legacy storage systems products  which are being phased out of customer applications  partially offset by contributions from our new sata and steelvine products 
we have experienced erosion of average selling prices for all of our product categories 
our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology 
most of the intellectual property we license includes a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building a chip in direct competition with those market segments we have chosen to pursue 
revenue from development for licensees  licensing and royalties accounted for  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in licensing revenues in as compared to is primarily due to recognition of million of revenue for the delivery of the ip technology sold  which represented the million license amount less million for the fair value of support and maintenance which we are required to provide to sunplus for one year 
we completed the delivery of ip technology sold to sunplus under the license agreement and received final acceptance 
the increase in was primarily due to recognition of million of royalty revenues related to the settlement agreement with genesis microchip in the fourth quarter of and the recognition of revenue for certain development projects that were previously deferred 
licensing contracts are complex and the recognition of related revenue depends upon many factors that require significant judgments including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
revenues from products sold into the ce market have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenues and generated  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we include licensing revenues  these percentages would be  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the ce product revenue in was due primarily to strong sales volumes of hdmi receivers and transmitters partially offset by decrease in asps 
our hdmi chips are targeted towards the dtv  av receiver  blu ray recorders  hd dvd  dvd  game console and mobile markets 
we believe that as the market acceptance of the hdmi standard continues to grow and with our anticipated new product offerings in are introduced sales of our ce products will contribute a significant percentage of our ce revenues 
product revenues from the pc market have declined in as compared to and and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenues in if we include licensing revenues  these percentages would be  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in pc revenues as compared to and is primarily due to lower shipments coupled with declines in asps of our hdmi and dvi products 
the decrease in asp in the pc business is due to the competitive nature of the pc business 
we expect the pc revenues in absolute dollars to decline in as compared to 
table of contents the slight increase in pc revenue for as compared to is primarily as a result of dvi sales increasing in due to the peaking of the adoption of the standard 
while revenues grew in absolute dollars  our pc product revenues were negatively affected by battery recalls by major computer manufacturers as well as the late launch of windows vista operating system 
licensing revenues included in our revenues from the pc market increased substantially in due to the recognition of royalty revenues related to the settlement agreement with genesis microchip 
products sold into the storage market  as a percentage of our total revenues  generated  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we include storage related licensing revenues  these percentages were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in storage revenues is due primarily to the integration of sata into pc chipsets obviating the need for our sata controllers in all but the highest value pc motherboards 
the decline in storage revenue from to is primarily due to declining sales in sata controllers partially offset by an increase in storage processor products 
demand for our storage products is dependent upon market acceptance of our steelvine architecture and the extent to which sata is integrated into chipsets and controllers offered by other companies  which would make our discrete devices unnecessary 
cost of revenue and gross margin change change dollars in thousands cost of revenue total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenue includes stock based compensation expense benefit cost of revenue consists primarily of costs incurred to manufacture  assemble and test our products  as well as related overhead costs 
gross margin revenue minus cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenue in as compared to and is primarily due to increased unit volume associated with increased sales partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and cost of sales associated with licensing revenue that has not increased proportionately to licensing sales 
cost of revenue for includes approximately million related to million of product revenue recognized from distributor sales for the month of december 
historically  we have deferred the recognition of sell through revenue and the related costs from distributor sales for the third month of a quarter until the following quarter due to the unavailability of reliable sell through information in a timely manner 
as a result of improved business processes  we have been able to eliminate this delay beginning with the fourth quarter of  resulting in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year cost of revenues to increase 
this increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs by lower negotiated vendor expenses as well as increased use of company owned testers 
decrease in gross margins in as compared to and is primarily due to increased competition in all business lines reflected in decline in asps erosion partially offset by increase in units sold

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
the following represents the potential decrease to the value of our investments given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the following represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and short term investments and accounts receivable 
a majority of our cash and investments are maintained with two major financial institutions headquartered in the united states 
as part of our cash and investment management processes  we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from investments held at these financial institutions 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our investment securities consist of various major corporations and financial institutions of high credit standing 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and may require collateral  such as letters of credit  to secure accounts receivable if deemed necessary 
we maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of collectability 
foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  the south korean won  taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our future operating results or cash flows as any such increases in our currency exchange rate may result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs as well as ongoing operating activities in our foreign operations 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices or vice versa  for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results 
cash balances held in foreign 
table of contents countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
as of december   cash held in foreign countries was approximately million
