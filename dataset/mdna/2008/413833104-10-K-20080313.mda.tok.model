background and overview we incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in august in  we completed an initial public offering and invested  in otisville biotech  inc  which also completed an initial public offering later that year 
in  charles e 
harris purchased a controlling interest in us which also made him the control person of otisville 
we then divested our other assets and became a financial services company  with the investment in otisville as the initial focus of our business activity 
in  we registered as an investment company under the act  commencing operations as a closed end  non diversified investment company 
in  we elected to become a business development company subject to the provisions of sections through of the act 
throughout our corporate history  we have made early stage venture capital investments in a variety of industries 
we define venture capital investments as investments in start up firms and small businesses with exceptional growth potential 
we have invested a substantial portion of our assets in venture capital investments of private  development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth  have little or no history of operations and are developing unproven technologies 
at december    or percent  of our net assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  at december    or percent  of our net assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  since our investment in otisville in through december   we have made a total of venture capital investments  including four private placement investments in securities of publicly traded companies 
we have sold of these investments  realizing total proceeds of  on our invested capital of  as measured from first dollar in to last dollar out  the average and median holding periods for these investments were years and years  respectively 
as measured by the separate rounds of investment within these investments  the average and median holding periods for the separate rounds of investment were years and years  respectively 
in  we made our first tiny technology investment 
from august through december   all of our initial investments have been in tiny technology 
from august through december   we have invested a total before any subsequent write ups  write downs or dispositions of  in tiny technology 
we currently have active tiny technology companies in our portfolio  including one tiny technology investment made prior to at december   from first dollar in  the average and median holding periods for these active tiny technology investments were years and years  respectively 
the following is a summary of our initial and follow on investments in tiny technology from to the present 
we consider a round led to be a round where we were the new investor or the leader of a set of new investors in an investee company 
typically  but not always  the lead investor negotiates the price and terms of a deal with the investee company 
total incremental investments no 
of new investments no 
of follow on investment rounds no 
of rounds led average dollar amount initial average dollar amount follow on n a we value our private venture capital investments each quarter as determined in good faith by our valuation committee  a committee of independent directors  within guidelines established by our board of directors in accordance with the act 
see footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
in the years through  the company recorded the following gross write ups in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year boy  gross write downs in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year  and net write ups write downs in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year

however  we invest primarily in illiquid equity securities of private companies 
generally  these investments take the form of preferred stock  are subject to restrictions on resale and have no established trading market 
our principal objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation 
therefore  a significant portion of our investment portfolio provides little or no income in the form of dividends or interest 
we earn interest income from fixed income securities  including us government and agency securities 
the amount of interest income we earn varies with the average balance of our fixed income portfolio and the average yield on this portfolio 
interest income is secondary to capital gains and losses in our results of operations 
we present the financial results of our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance during any period is the net increase decrease in our net assets resulting from our operating activities  which is the sum of the following three elements net operating income loss the difference between our income from interest  dividends  and fees and our operating expenses 
net realized income loss on investments the difference between the net proceeds of sales of portfolio securities and their stated cost  plus income from interests in limited liability companies 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments the net unrealized change in the value of our investment portfolio 
owing to the structure and objectives of our business  we generally expect to experience net operating losses and seek to generate increases in our net assets from operations through the long term appreciation of our venture capital investments 
we have relied  and continue to rely  on proceeds from sales of investments  rather than on investment income  to defray a significant portion of our operating expenses 
because such sales are unpredictable  we attempt to maintain adequate working capital to provide for fiscal periods when there are no such sales 
results of operations years ended december    and during the years ended december    and  we had net decreases increases in net assets resulting from operations of   and  respectively 
investment income and expenses during the years ended december    and  we had net operating losses of   and  respectively 
the variation in these results is primarily owing to the changes in investment income and operating expenses  including non cash expense of  in and  in associated with the granting of stock options 
during the years ended december    and  total investment income was   and  respectively

during the twelve months ended december   our average holdings of such securities were  as compared with  at december operating expenses  including non cash  stock based compensation expenses  were  and  for the twelve months ended december   and december   respectively 
the increase in operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december   was primarily owing to increases in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expenses and to increases in administration and operations expense  professional fees and directors fees and expenses 
salaries  benefits and non cash  stock based compensation expense increased by  or percent  through december   as compared to december   primarily as a result of an increase in non cash expense of  through december   associated with the harris harris group  inc equity incentive plan the stock plan 
while the non cash  stock based  compensation expense for the stock plan increased our operating expenses by  this increase was offset by a corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital  resulting in no net impact to our net asset value 
the non cash  stock based  compensation expense and corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital may increase in future quarters 
salaries and benefits also increased for the twelve months ended december   owing to an increase in our headcount as compared with that of the same period in at december   we had full time employees  as compared with full time employees and one part time employee at december  administration and operations expense increased by  or percent  for the twelve months ended december   as compared with the same period in  owing to an increase in nasdaq global market fees related to the increase in our number of outstanding shares and increased office related and travel expenses related to the increase in headcount 
professional fees increased by  or percent  primarily as a result of an increase in legal fees  an increase in audit fees and corporate consulting costs for the audit of our compliance program 
directors fees and expenses increased by  or percent  primarily as a result of additional meetings held in the period ended december   as compared with the period ended december   as well as an increase in the monthly retainers paid to committee chairs and to the lead independent director

salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense increased by  or percent  for the year ended december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of non cash expense of  associated with the stock plan adopted during the second quarter of and secondarily as a result of an increase in the number of full time employees 
the increase in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense reflects expenses associated with ten full time employees and one part time employee during the year ended december   as compared with an average of nine full time employees during the year ended december  salaries  benefits and stock based compensation include  of non cash expense associated with the stock plan  versus no such charge in directors fees and expenses increased by  or percent  as a result of additional meetings held in related to the adoption of the stock plan 
administrative and operations expense decreased by  or percent  primarily as a result of a decrease in our directors and officers liability insurance expense and decreases in the cost of proxy related expenses 
profit sharing expense for the year ended december   was  as compared with  for december   owing to the termination of the profit sharing plan effective may  we recorded  of profit sharing expense toward the remainder of the profit sharing payment in the year ended december   because of updated estimates of our ultimate tax liability for professional fees decreased by  or percent  for the year ended december   as compared with december  professional fees were lower for the year ended december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of the elimination of consulting costs incurred for a temporary senior controller in and the reduction of some of our sarbanes oxley related compliance costs incurred in the increase in operating expenses during was primarily owing to increases in the profit sharing provision  salaries and benefits  professional fees  administration and operations  rent expense and directors fees and expenses 
profit sharing expense for was  an increase of  as compared with profit sharing expense increased primarily as a result of the gains realized on the sale of neurometrix  inc  offset by the taxes payable by the company on the deemed dividend and taxes payable on built in gains 
the profit sharing expense was also impacted by the company s decision to retain its net realized long term capital gains for reinvestment for growth  rather than distribute them as a cash dividend 
when the company chooses to retain its net realized long term capital gains  it declares a deemed dividend and pays taxes on behalf of shareholders 
conversely  when the company distributes its net realized long term capital gains as a cash dividend  the shareholders pay all of the taxes 
the taxes payable by the company on behalf of shareholders reduce the amount of profit against which the profit sharing payable to employees is calculated 
had the company chosen to distribute its net realized long term capital gains as a cash dividend  the provision for employee profit sharing would have been  for  rather than the actual provision for employee profit sharing of  for for the year ended december   as compared with  salaries and benefits increased by  or percent  primarily as a result of the addition of three employees 
professional fees increased by  or percent  reflecting in part the expenses associated with ongoing compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of administration and operations increased by  or percent  primarily as the result of increases in travel expenses associated with additional investments in portfolio companies  increases in expenses related to the preparation and distribution of the annual and quarterly reports and proxy statement owing to the increased number of shareholders  and an increase in the premium expense for director and officer liability insurance

directors fees and expenses in increased by  or percent as a result of an increase in the fees paid to the directors for monthly retainer and meeting attendance 
realized income and losses on investments during the years ended december    and  we had net realized income from investments of   and  respectively 
the variation in these results is primarily owing to variations in gross realized income from investments and income taxes in each of the three years

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the footnote to the consolidated schedule of investments 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be critical stock based compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
management uses the black scholes option pricing model because of the lack of the historical option data that is required for use in other  more complex models 
other models may yield fair values that are significantly different from those calculated by the black scholes option pricing model 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  require the use of subjective input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
in the black scholes model  variations in the expected volatility or expected term assumptions have a significant impact on fair value 
as the volatility or expected term assumptions increase  the fair value of the stock option increases 
in the black scholes model  the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
a higher assumed dividend rate yields a lower fair value  whereas higher assumed interest rates yield higher fair values for stock options 
we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin because of the lack of historical information about option exercise patterns 
future exercise behavior could be materially different than that which is assumed by the model 
expected volatility is based on the historical fluctuations in the company s stock 
the company s stock has historically been volatile  which increases the fair value 
sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited owing to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after the grant date is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
such adjustments would affect our operating expenses and additional paid in capital  but would have no effect on our net asset value 
valuation of portfolio investments as a business development company  we invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of private companies 
these investments are generally subject to restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
we value substantially all of our equity investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our valuation committee on a quarterly basis 
the valuation committee  comprised of all of our non interested board members  reviews and approves the valuation of our investments within the valuation procedures established by the board of directors 
fair value is generally defined as the amount that an investment could be sold for in an orderly disposition over a reasonable time 
generally  to increase objectivity in valuing our assets  external measures of value  such as public markets or third party transactions  are utilized whenever possible 
valuation is not based on long term work out value  nor immediate liquidation value  nor incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated 
this difference could be material 
pension and post retirement benefit plan assumptions the company provides a retiree medical benefit plan for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability values related to our post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about the discount rate  the rate of increase in healthcare costs  and mortality  among others 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the post retirement benefit liabilities could be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments for plan participants 
in estimating this rate  we consider rates of return on high quality fixed income investments included in published bond indexes 
we consider the moody s aa corporate bond index and the citigroup pension liability index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we utilized to measure our post retirement benefit obligation as of december   and to calculate our expense was percent  which is an increase from the percent rate used in determining the expense 
recent developments portfolio companies two of our portfolio companies have been considering with their advisors the possibility of filing for initial public offerings ipos in there can be no assurance that either of them will file for an ipo in  and a variety of factors  including stock market and general business conditions  could lead either or both of them to terminate such considerations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk and the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates 
although we are risk seeking rather than risk averse in our investments  we consider the management of risk to be essential to our business 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which market quotations are readily available and ii fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see the valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
neither our investments nor an investment in us is intended to constitute a balanced investment program 
we have invested a substantial portion of our assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be based on new technology and to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth and have not attained profitability or have no history of operations 
because of the speculative nature and the lack of a public market for these investments  there is significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
we expect that some of our venture capital investments will be a complete loss or will be unprofitable and that some will appear to be likely to become successful but never realize their potential 
even when our private equity investments complete initial public offerings ipos  we are normally subject to lock up agreements for a period of time  and thereafter  the market for the unseasoned publicly traded securities may be relatively illiquid 
because there is typically no public market for our interests in the small privately held companies in which we invest  the valuation of the equity interests in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our valuation committee  comprised of the independent members of our board of directors  in accordance with our valuation procedures 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the determined value of our portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments 
changes in valuation of any of our investments in privately held companies from one period to another may be volatile 
we also invest in short term money market instruments  and both short and long term us government and agency securities 
to the extent that we invest in short and long term us government and agency securities  changes in interest rates result in changes in the value of these obligations which result in an increase or decrease of our net asset value 
the level of interest rate risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment  the expectations of future price and market movements  and the quantity and duration of both the short and long term us government and agency securities held by the company  and it will vary from period to period 
if the average interest rate on us government and agency securities at december   were to increase by  and basis points  the weighted average value of these securities held by us at december   would decrease by approximately   and  respectively  and our net asset value would decrease correspondingly 
most of our investments are denominated in us dollars 
we currently have one investment denominated in canadian dollars 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to potential changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value on this investment resulting from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is  at december  in addition  in the future  we may from time to time opt to borrow money to make investments 
our net investment income will be dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest such funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in the event we choose to borrow funds for investing purposes
