item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview scana  through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in parts of south carolina and the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary  scana markets natural gas to retail customers in georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast 
other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units 
additionally  a service company subsidiary of scana provides administrative  management and other services to the other subsidiaries 
the following map indicates areas where the company s significant business segments conducted their activities  as further described in this overview section 

table of contents the following percentages reflect revenues and net income earned by the company s regulated and nonregulated businesses and the percentage of total assets held by them 
of revenues a regulated nonregulated of net income b regulated nonregulated of assets regulated nonregulated a in  revenues reflects the change in business model in the gas transmission segment

key earnings drivers for the company over the next five years will be additions to rate base at south carolina electric gas company sce g  carolina gas transmission corporation cgtc and public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy  consisting primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities  new generating capacity and system expansion 
other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment  customer growth in each of the regulated utility businesses  consistent earnings in the natural gas marketing business in georgia and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses 
electric operations the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce g  south carolina generating company  inc genco and south carolina fuel company  inc fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in south carolina 
at december  sce g provided electricity to  customers in an area covering nearly  square miles 
genco owns a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to sce g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce g s nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements 
operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
sce g s allowed return on equity may not exceed  with rates set at 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
sce g is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and  therefore  the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
legislative and regulatory initiatives  including the energy policy act of the energy policy act also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment 
the energy policy act became law in august  and it provided  among other things  for the establishment of an electric reliability organization ero to propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for transmission systems and for procedures governing enforcement actions by the ero and federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
consistent with reliability provisions of the energy policy act  on july   ferc issued a final rule certifying the north american electric reliability council nerc as the ero 
on march   ferc issued a final rule establishing mandatory  enforceable reliability standards for the nation s bulk power system 
in the final rule  ferc approved of the mandatory reliability standards submitted by the nerc and compliance with these standards became mandatory on june  ferc has subsequently approved critical infrastructure protection standards which are mandatory and enforceable 
the company cannot predict when or if ferc will advance other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities 
new legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted  and if it is  the conditions it would impose on utilities 
gas distribution the gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of sce g and psnc energy  and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december  this segment provided natural gas to  customers in areas covering  square miles 
operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
significant supply disruptions occurred in september and october as a result of hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements 
while supply disruptions were not experienced in or  the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure 
the long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined 
gas transmission cgtc operates an open access  transportation only interstate pipeline company regulated by ferc 
cgtc s operating results are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
demand for cgtc s services is closely linked to demand for natural gas and is affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
cgtc provides transportation services to sce g for its gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs and to scana energy marketing  inc semi for natural gas marketing 
cgtc also provides transportation services to other natural gas utilities  municipalities and county gas authorities and to industrial customers 
effective november  scg pipeline merged into south carolina pipeline corporation scpc and the merged company changed its name to carolina gas transmission corporation 
prior to the merger  the gas transmission segment was comprised solely of scpc  which owned and operated an intrastate pipeline engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies including sce g and industrial customers throughout most of south carolina 
scpc s operating results were primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
retail gas marketing scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to over  customers as of december  throughout georgia 
scana energy s total customer base represents over a share of the approximately million customers in georgia s deregulated natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
scana energy s competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in georgia s energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana energy s ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
as georgia s regulated provider  scana energy serves low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the georgia public service commission gpsc  and it receives funding from the universal service fund for some of the bad debt associated with the low income group 
scana energy s service as georgia s regulated provider of natural gas ends august  scana energy files financial and other information periodically with the gpsc  and such information is available at www

at december   scana energy s regulated division served over  customers 

table of contents scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments  including commodity swaps and futures contracts  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
further  there can be no assurance that georgia s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve 
in february the consumer affairs staff the staff of the gpsc alleged to the gpsc that scana energy and the state s largest natural gas marketer the marketers had overcharged certain of their respective customers 
the staff alleges that the marketers failed to inform customers with more expensive rate plans that a lower rate plan was available  charged customers in excess of the published price  and failed to give proper notice of a change in methodology for computing variable rates 
scana energy believes it complied with all applicable rules and regulations  that none of its customers were treated unfairly  and that all requests it received from customers to be switched to a lower rate plan were honored 
scana energy has responded that these types of pricing plans exist in many deregulated markets  such as telecommunications  and are a natural development in a competitive environment 
the gpsc has indicated that it may launch a formal investigation into the matter  and is expected to rule on the matter on march  separately  without admitting fault  the other marketer has offered to settle the matter before the gpsc by agreeing to improve communications and to pay million to the low income home energy assistance program 
scana energy is currently in discussions with the gpsc to settle the matter 
while the company cannot determine the final outcome  it believes that a resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
on february   a purported class action was filed in us district court for the northern district of georgia  styled weiskircher  et al 
v 
scana energy marketing  inc  containing similar allegations to those alleged by the staff and seeking damages on behalf of a class of georgia customers 
scana energy has not been served with this lawsuit and has not yet had the opportunity to evaluate it 
energy marketing the divisions of semi  excluding scana energy energy marketing  comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to customers 
the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
in addition  certain pipeline capacity available for energy marketing to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by scana energy in the retail market 

results of operations the company s reported earnings are prepared in accordance with gaap 
management believes that  in addition to reported earnings under gaap  the company s gaap adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performance period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data 
in management s opinion  gaap adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the company s primary businesses 
this measure is also a basis for management s provision of earnings guidance and growth projections  and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions 
this non gaap performance measure is not intended to replace the gaap measure of net earnings  but is offered as a supplement to it 
a reconciliation of reported gaap earnings per share to gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share is provided in the table below reported gaap earnings per share deduct cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax reduction in charge related to propane litigation gains from sales of telecommunications investments gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share cash dividends declared per share discussion of above adjustments the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulted from the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the reduction in charge related to propane litigation resulted from litigation arising from the prior sale of the company s propane business being settled for an amount that was less than had been accrued previously 
this reduction appears in the income statement as a reduction to other expenses 
realized gains in were recognized on sales of telecommunications investments 
management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining the non gaap financial performance measure 
management utilizes such measure in exercising budgetary control  managing business operations and determining eligibility for certain incentive compensation payments 
the non gaap measure  gaap adjusted net earnings per share from operations  provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by excluding the cumulative effect on per share earnings of the accounting change resulting from the company s adoption of sfas r  the effect on per share earnings of transactions involving the company s telecommunications investments and of litigation related to the sale of a prior business

recognition of synthetic fuel tax credits sce g holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel  the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits 
under an accounting methodology approved by the scpsc in a january order  construction costs related to the lake murray back up dam project are recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account  outside of rate base  and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis  subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits 
the synthetic fuel tax credit program expired at the end of the level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits  less partnership losses and other expenses  net of taxes 
as a result  the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account declines as accelerated depreciation is recorded 
although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income  they can have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement 
in addition  sce g records non cash carrying costs on the unrecovered investment 
the accelerated depreciation  synthetic fuel tax credits  partnership losses and the income tax benefit arising from such losses recognized by sce g during and are as follows millions of dollars depreciation and amortization expense income tax benefits from synthetic fuel tax credits from accelerated depreciation from partnership losses total income tax benefits losses from equity method investments impact on net income the amounts are estimates based on preliminary benchmark information and reflect the likelihood that credits available in will be phased down pursuant to regulations which limit the credits based on the relative commodity price of crude oil 
amounts in reflect the recognition of previously deferred tax credits 
see discussion below 
the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits is dependent on the average annual domestic wellhead price per barrel of crude oil as published by the us government 
under a phase out provision included in the program  if the domestic wellhead reference price of oil per barrel for a given year is below an inflation adjusted benchmark range for that year  all of the synthetic fuel tax credits that have been generated in that year would be available for use 
if that price is above the benchmark range  none of the tax credits would be available 
if that price falls within the benchmark range  a calculated portion of the credits would be available 
the benchmark price range for resulted in a phase out of for sce g s analysis indicates that the available synthetic fuel tax credits for also are likely to be impacted by the phase out calculation 
as such  in the company recorded synthetic fuel tax credits and applied those credits to allow the recording of accelerated depreciation related to the balance in the dam remediation project account based on an estimate that only of credits generated in will be available phase out of 
the u 
s 
government is expected to publish the benchmark price range for in the second quarter of  after which the company will finalize its estimate of available credits 
the company does not expect available credits to be sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of dam remediation 
to the extent that available credits are not sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of the dam remediation  regulatory action to allow recovery of those remaining costs will likely be sought 
as of december   remaining unrecovered costs  based on management s recording of accelerated depreciation and related tax benefits  were million 
the company expects these costs to be recoverable through rates 

table of contents finally  scana  through a subsidiary  provided management and maintenance services for a non affiliated synthetic fuel production facility 
reduced synthetic fuel tax credit availability under the above phase out provisions also adversely impacted the level of payment scana received for these services 
these services ceased on december   concurrent with the expiration of the synthetic fuel tax credit program 

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements for scana s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs  funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to scana 
the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought 
the future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief  if requested 
sce g expects to add additional base load electric generation in the to timeframe 
based on an evaluation of alternatives  sce g and santee cooper  a state owned utility in south carolina joint owners of summer station have selected the summer station site as the preferred site if new nuclear generation is built 
due to the significant lead time required for construction of nuclear generation  the joint owners are preparing an application to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for a combined construction and operating license col that would cover two new nuclear units 
the col application  if submitted  would be reviewed by the nrc for an estimated three years 
sce g is uncertain if or when a col would be submitted to the nrc 
while sce g s current plans are to pursue the development of one or both of these nuclear units  these plans will continue to be influenced by many factors  including nrc licensing attainment  ongoing evaluation of relative construction and operating costs  the cost of competing fuels  regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market conditions 
in may  the base load review act the act became law in south carolina 
this law is intended to allow a utility to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs associated with new nuclear or coal fired base load electric generating facilities larger than megawatts 
based on an application filed by the utility under the act  the scpsc would review and rule on the prudency of the decision to build the plant 
if the decision was found to be prudent  that finding would be binding on all future proceedings so long as the plant is constructed in accordance with the schedules  estimates and projections set forth in the approved application 
in addition  beginning with the initial proceeding  the utility would be allowed to file revised rates with the scpsc each year to incorporate any nuclear construction work in progress incurred 
requested rate adjustments would be based on the utility s updated cost of debt and capital structure 
the cost of service and rate design would be based on the rates approved in the utility s most recent electric rate order 
the utility may choose to file for a project specific return on common equity or use the return from its most recent rate proceeding if the proceeding is less than five years old 
scana s leverage ratio of debt to capital was approximately at december  scana has publicly announced its desire to maintain this leverage ratio at to  but scana s ability to do so depends on a number of factors 
if scana is not able to maintain its leverage ratio  scana s debt ratings may be affected  it may be required to pay higher interest rates on its long and short term indebtedness  and its access to the capital markets may be limited 
the company s current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for  which are subject to continuing review and adjustment  are as follows

forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary make whole or default provisions  but are not considered to be take or pay contracts 
certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses  therefore  the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates 
also included in other commercial commitments is a take and pay contract for natural gas which expires in and estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so 
the company may terminate such arrangements without penalty 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations above  the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees 
the pension plan is adequately funded  and no further contributions are anticipated until after cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were million in  and such annual payments are expected to increase to the million range in the future 
in addition  the company is party to certain new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash

no such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal  interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes 
at december   the ten percent test would have limited total issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately million 
unsecured indebtedness at december   totaled million  and was comprised primarily of short term borrowings 
financing cash flows during the company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of million primarily due to the payment of dividends  which were partially offset by net increases in short term borrowings 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
these swap agreements provide for the company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments 
the company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge 
payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s swaps totaled a million gain related to combined notional amounts of million 
in anticipation of the issuance of debt  the company may use interest rate lock or similar swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
these arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges 
payments made or received upon termination of such agreements by regulated subsidiaries are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities  respectively  and if by the holding company  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
payments made or received are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt 
as permitted by sfas statement of cash flows net reporting of certain cash receipts and cash payments and classification of cash flows from hedging transactions  payments received or made are classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in june scana entered into an agreement to issue and sell floating rate senior notes due june   in an aggregate principal amount of between million and million

environmental matters the company s regulated operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes 
applicable statutes and rules include the clean air act  as amended caa  the clean air interstate rule cair  the clean air mercury rule camr  the clean water act  the nuclear waste policy act of nuclear waste act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  among others 
compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs  which the company expects to recover through existing ratemaking provisions 

table of contents for the three years ended december   the company s capital expenditures for environmental control totaled million 
these expenditures were in addition to environmental expenditures included in other operation and maintenance expenses  which were million during  million during  and million during it is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters  but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the company are million for and million for the four year period these expenditures are included in the company s estimated capital expenditures table  discussed in liquidity and capital resources  and include the matters discussed below 
in addition  the company is monitoring federal legislative proposals that  among other things  may require significant reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions widely believed to contribute to global climate change 
such legislation could impose a tax based on the carbon content of primary fossil fuels used by the company  such as coal and natural gas 
other proposals call for implementation of a cap and trade program as a means of meeting stringent new emissions standards 
a national mandatory renewable portfolio standard rps may also be considered 
under an rps  electric utilities would be required to generate a specific percentage of their power from sources deemed to be climate friendly  such as solar  wind  geothermal and agricultural waste  over varying periods of time 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these proposals 
at the state level  no significant environmental legislation that would affect the company s operations advanced during the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be introduced or enacted in  or if new regulations or changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be implemented in the coming year 
air quality the united states environmental protection agency epa issued cair as a final rule in known as cair 
cair requires the district of columbia and states  including south carolina  to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels 
cair sets emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nitrogen oxide and beginning in and  respectively  for sulfur dioxide 
numerous states  environmental organizations  industry groups and individual companies have challenged the rule  seeking a change in the method cair uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
the company believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to meet the cair requirements 
although compliance plans and costs to comply with the rule have not been determined  it is believed that such costs will be material and will be recoverable through rates 
the epa issued a final rule referred to as camr in establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants that required limits to be met in two phases  in and numerous parties challenged the rule 
on february   the united states circuit court for the district of columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units 
the company cannot predict the effect of this ruling on implementation of camr state implementation plans sips and newly promulgated camr regulations by the states 
the epa has undertaken an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry  and the united states department of justice doj has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
at least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided neither favorable to the industry 
one of the decisions is not believed to be binding as precedent and the other one  described more fully below  may be 
on april   in a unanimous ruling  the us supreme court vacated a decision by the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit that effectively halted the epa enforcement action against duke energy corporation duke for allegedly performing plant modifications without a required permit 
such modifications for life extension and modernization as performed by duke and other utilities  including sce g  were common within the industry 
hence this decision may heighten the potential exposure of utilities to enforcement actions such as those already brought against duke and others  many of which had not proceeded pending this supreme court decision 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa  under a stringent rule known as new source review nsr  that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
on october   epa published a final revised nsr rule in the federal register with an effective date of december  the rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the nsr enforcement initiative 
however  on motion of several northeastern states  the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the effect of the final rule 
the ultimate application of the final rule to the company is uncertain 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
the current state of continued doj enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation  but it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce g and genco  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the company s compliance with the caa would be without merit 
the company has completed installation of selective catalytic reactors at wateree and williams for nitrogen oxides control and is proceeding with plans to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers at both of these stations to meet cair regulations 
these actions would mitigate many of the concerns with nsr 
sce g and genco expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately million over the period to install this new equipment 
sce g and genco expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million in and million in and each year thereafter 
to meet compliance requirements for the years  sce g and genco anticipate additional capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
water quality the clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under the clean water act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all  and renewed for nearly all  of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges  has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures  and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the clean water act 
such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards 
these provisions  if passed  could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company  sce g and genco 
hazardous and solid wastes the nuclear waste act required that the united states government accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by january  the nuclear waste act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available 
sce g entered into a standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste with the doe in as of december   the federal government has not accepted any spent fuel from summer station or any other utility  and it remains unclear when the repository may become available 
sce g has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of summer station through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available 
the provisions of cercla authorize the epa to require the clean up of hazardous waste sites 
in addition  the states of south carolina and north carolina have similar laws 
the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up 
in addition  regulators from the epa and other federal or state agencies periodically notify the company that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations 
such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
the company has assessed the following matters 
electric operations sce g has been named  along with others  by the epa as a potentially responsible party prp at the alternate energy resources  inc aer superfund site located in augusta  georgia 
the epa placed the site on the national priorities list on april  aer conducted hazardous waste storage and treatment operations from to  when the site was abandoned 
while operational  aer processed fuels from waste oils  treated industrial coolants and oil water emulsions  recycled solvents and blended hazardous waste fuels 
during that time  sce g occasionally used aer for the processing of waste solvents  oily rags and oily wastewater 
the epa and the state of georgia have documented that a release or releases have occurred at the site leading to contamination of groundwater  surface water and soils 
the epa and the state of georgia have conducted a preliminary assessment and site inspection 
the site has not been remediated nor has a clean up cost been estimated 
although a basis for the allocation of 
table of contents clean up costs among the prps is unclear  sce g does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
any cost allocated to sce g arising from the remediation of this site  net of insurance recoveries  if any  is expected to be recoverable through rates 
sce g has been named  along with others  by the epa as a prp at the carolina transformer superfund site located in fayetteville  north carolina 
the carolina transformer company ctc conducted an electrical transformer rebuilding and repair operation at the site from approximately to during that time  sce g occasionally used ctc for the repair of existing transformers  purchase of new transformers and sale of used transformers 
in  the epa initiated a remediation of pcb contaminated soil and groundwater at the site 
the epa reports that it has spent million to date 
in  sce g  along with other parties  reached a settlement with the epa and the us department of justice on this matter 
the settlement  which is subject to court approval  would result in an allocation of cost  net of insurance recoveries  to sce g that is not material  and such cost is expected to be recoverable through rates 
gas distribution sce g is responsible for four decommissioned manufactured gas plant mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
these sites are in various stages of investigation  remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until and will cost an additional million 
in addition  the national park service of the department of the interior made an initial demand to sce g for payment of million for certain costs and damages relating to the mgp site in charleston  south carolina 
sce g expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of these four sites through rates 
at december   deferred amounts  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million 
psnc energy is responsible for environmental clean up at five sites in north carolina on which mgp residuals are present or suspected 
psnc energy s actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
psnc energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  which reflects its estimated remaining liability at december  psnc energy expects to recover through rates any costs  net of insurance recoveries  allocable to psnc energy arising from the remediation of these sites through rates 

regulatory matters material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to the jurisdiction of the scpsc as to retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term borrowings and other matters 
in may  the law was changed to revise the statutory definition of fuel costs to include certain variable environmental costs such as ammonia  lime  limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions 
the revised definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide  and mercury and particulates 
the natural gas rate stabilization act of allows natural gas distribution companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment 
such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the scpsc 
public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the ncuc as to gas rates  issuance of securities other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less  accounting and other matters 
on february   psnc energy filed a letter of intent with the ncuc indicating its intention to file an application for a general increase in its rates and charges on or about march  
table of contents the united states congress passed the pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety act  directing the united states department of transportation dot to establish the integrity management rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations 
of psnc energy s approximately miles of transmission pipeline subject to the pipeline safety act  approximately miles are located within these areas 
fifty percent of these miles of pipeline were required to be assessed by december  and the remainder by december through december  psnc energy has achieved a completion rate of eighty five percent 
depending on the assessment method used  psnc energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline approximately every seven years 
though cost estimates for this program were developed using various assumptions  each of which is subject to imprecision  psnc energy currently estimates the total cost through december to be million for the initial assessments  not including any subsequent remediation that may be required 
effective november  the ncuc authorized deferral accounting for certain expenses incurred to comply with dot s pipeline integrity management requirements 
in accordance with an october ncuc rate order  million in costs incurred and deferred through june  are now being recovered through rates over a three year period 
additionally  the rate order approved continuance of deferred accounting treatment for certain pipeline integrity management expenses until resolution of psnc energy s next general rate proceeding 
carolina gas transmission corporation cgtc has approximately miles of transmission line that are covered by the integrity management rule of the pipeline safety act 
though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions  each of which is subject to imprecision  cgtc currently estimates the total cost to be million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through december 
critical accounting policies and estimates following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
utility regulation scana s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity or financial position of the company s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company s environmental assessment program 
the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in those assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december   the company s net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately billion and million  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of the company s utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of million at december  and million at december   compared to total revenues for each year and of billion 

table of contents provisions for bad debts and allowances for doubtful accounts as of each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts  assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts  credit scores for residential customers in georgia when available  and consideration of actual write off history 
the distribution segments of the company s regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that tend to improve the recoverability of accounts and enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts 
the company s retail gas marketing segment operates in georgia s deregulated natural gas market in which customers may obtain service from others without necessarily paying outstanding amounts and in which there are certain limitations on the company s ability to effect timely shut off of service for nonpayment 
as such  estimation of the provision for bad debts for these accounts is subject to greater imprecision 
nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
sce g s two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination  totals million  stated in dollars 
santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in summer station 
the cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use 
under sce g s method of funding decommissioning costs  amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds  and interest on proceeds  less expenses 
the trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies held by the trust 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the company follows sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas  employees accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  in accounting for the cost of its defined benefit pension plan 
the company s plan is adequately funded and as such  net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations pension income 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets 
net pension income of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension income amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have decreased the company s pension income by million 
had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been  the company s pension income for would have been reduced by million 
the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted 
the company determines the fair value of a majority of its pension assets utilizing market quotes  with the remaining fair value derived from modeling techniques that incorporate market data 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical performance  targeted allocation amounts and expected payment terms 
the plan s historical   and year cumulative performance showed actual returns of   and  respectively  all of which have been in excess of related broad indices 
the expected long term rate of return of was based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate 
for  the expected rate of return will be 

table of contents the pension trust is adequately funded  and no contributions have been required since management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after similar to its pension accounting  the company follows sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended by sfas  in accounting for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
the company used a discount rate of  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and recorded a net sfas cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been million higher 
because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs  healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded 
asset retirement obligations sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  together with financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets aro 
sfas applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation 
because such obligation relates primarily to the company s regulated utility operations  sfas and fin have no significant impact on results of operations 
as of december   the company has recorded an aro of million for nuclear plant decommissioning as discussed above and an aro of million for other conditional obligations related to generation  transmission and distribution properties  including gas pipelines 
all of the amounts recorded in connection with sfas and fin are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision  particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will be recorded over time  however  these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the company s utilities remains in place 

other matters off balance sheet transactions although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  or as described in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
scana does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions  although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture  equipment and rail cars
