item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which highlight additional considerations about healthsouth 
strategic repositioning in  we completed our strategic repositioning of the company as the largest provider of post acute rehabilitation services 
our determination to undertake this restructuring was based on a number of factors  including our realization that we had excessive debt for a health services company of our size and our desire to reduce our debt with the net proceeds received from the divestitures  allowing us to pursue growth opportunities in the inpatient rehabilitation and post acute care industries  our determination that our high leverage precluded appropriate investment in our businesses  limiting our ability to pursue growth opportunities  our belief that a post acute strategy would build on our core competencies in the area of inpatient rehabilitative care and would be responsive to industry trends  our conclusion that there were very few strategic or financial synergies in operating our divisions as one company  and  in some instances  our recognition that the strategic interests of the divisions were at cross purposes with one another  and our opportunity to benefit from the strong credit markets existing at the time to divest our non core assets 
the results of the repositioning are summarized in the table below and described in greater detail in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
division buyer close date net proceeds outpatient select medical corporation may  million surgery centers an affiliate of texas pacific group june  million diagnostic an affiliate of the gores group july  million after deducting deal and separation costs  purchase price adjustments  and any debt assumed by the respective purchaser  also includes net proceeds received for facilities sold after the initial close date 
other than with respect to certain facilities for which regulatory approvals had not yet been received 
historically  we reported five segments inpatient  surgery centers  outpatient  diagnostic  and corporate and other 
based on our strategic focus in the inpatient rehabilitation industry and the reclassification of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions to discontinued operations  we modified our segment reporting from five reportable segments to one reportable segment in the first quarter of amounts historically reported as part of our corporate and other segment  which primarily represented the corporate overhead costs associated with our operating divisions  are no longer considered a reportable segment by our chief operating decision maker due to our strategic repositioning as a pure play post acute care provider and the change in the manner in which we now manage the company 
rather  these corporate overhead costs are now presented on the line entitled general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the consolidated results of operations of the company presented herein represent the continuing operations of our inpatient division  including corporate overhead 
for additional information  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
leverage and liquidity many of the transactions in which we engaged in improved our leverage and liquidity 
during  we used the net proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions to pay down debt 
in addition  in october  we used approximately million of our million income tax recovery from the irs see note  long term debt  and note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to further reduce our outstanding debt 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we also used available cash and borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem approximately million of our senior notes due  which carry a higher interest rate than borrowings under our credit agreement see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we remain highly leveraged  our total debt outstanding has decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  we also made the final payments related to our medicare program settlement and our sec settlement see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in with these settlement payments behind us  we now will be able to redirect our operating cash elsewhere in the company 
based on our current borrowing capacity and leverage ratio required under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
our long term debt excluding notes payable to banks and others and capital lease obligations as of december  and is summarized in the following table as of december  as of december  in millions revolving credit facility term loan facility bonds payable as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excludes approximately million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities  which are assets whose use is restricted because of various obligations we have under lending agreements  partnership agreements  and other arrangements primarily related to our captive insurance company 
we expect our cash flow to improve  which should allow us to further reduce our debt 
any proceeds we may receive from additional income tax refunds  the expected sale of the corporate campus see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  and certain derivative litigation see note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements will also be used to further pay down our debt 
while we intend to direct a portion of our free cash flow into our development activities  focusing on joint ventures and other transactions that require a minimal initial outlay of cash  our primary focus in will be to pay down debt

securities litigation settlement on january   we received final court approval of the previously announced settlement agreements collectively  the settlement agreement with the lead plaintiffs in the federal securities class actions and the derivative actions  as well as certain of our insurance carriers collectively  the carriers  to settle litigation filed against us  certain of our former directors and officers and certain other parties in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama and the circuit court in jefferson county  alabama relating to financial reporting and related activity that occurred at healthsouth during periods ended in march the million settlement includes healthsouth common stock and warrants valued at million and cash payments by certain of our insurance carriers of million  with a contingent payout to the federal securities class of certain amounts that may be recovered by healthsouth in the future 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we are also required to indemnify the carriers  to the extent permitted by law  for any amounts that they become legally obligated to pay to any non settling defendants

income tax recovery in the third quarter of  we settled all federal income tax issues outstanding with the irs for the tax years through  and the joint committee of congress reviewed and approved the associated income tax refunds due to the company 
in october  we received a total cash refund of approximately million  including million in federal income tax refunds and million of associated interest 
approximately million of this federal income tax recovery was used to pay down long term debt  as discussed in note  long term debt  and in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inpatient rehabilitation business we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitation services 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide comprehensive services to patients who require intensive institutional rehabilitation care 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by a physician order 
internal case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation of patient status  achievement of goals  functional outcomes and efficiency 
we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and long term acute care hospitals and provide treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis 
as of december   our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs had  licensed beds 
as of december   we operated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals including hospitals which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
we are the sole owner of of these hospitals 
we retain a to ownership in the remaining jointly owned hospitals 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals are located in states  with a concentration of hospitals in texas  pennsylvania  florida  tennessee  and alabama 
as of december   we also had two hospitals in puerto rico  one of which began accepting patients in april as of december   we also operated freestanding ltchs  of which we own and one of which is a joint venture in which we have retained an ownership interest 
we also operated outpatient satellites located within or near and operated by our hospitals  of which are wholly owned and of which are jointly owned 
of these facilities  are located on property owned by us and the remaining locations are leased 
we also provide home health services through hospital based home health agencies 
in addition to healthsouth hospitals  we manage inpatient rehabilitation units  outpatient satellites  and one gamma knife radiosurgery center through management contracts 
because of our size  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the following ways quality 
our hospitals provide a broad base of clinical experience from which we have developed clinical best practices and protocols 
we believe these clinical best practices and protocols help ensure the delivery of consistently high quality rehabilitative services across all of our hospitals 
technology 
as a market leader in inpatient rehabilitation  we have devoted substantial resources to creating and leveraging rehabilitative technology 
for example  we have developed an innovative therapeutic device called the autoambulator  which can help advance the rehabilitative process for patients who experience difficulty walking 
in addition to clinical technology  we have also improved our business technology by migrating to one common billing and collections system  which has improved our administrative efficiency 
efficiency and cost effectiveness 
our size helps us provide inpatient rehabilitative services on a very cost effective basis 
specifically  because of our large number of inpatient hospitals  we can utilize standardized staffing models and take advantage of certain supply chain efficiencies 
we have also developed a program called teamworks  which is an operations focused initiative using identified best practices to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across a wide spectrum of operational areas 
now that we have concluded our strategic repositioning  we will focus on enhancing the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and growing our inpatient rehabilitation business through bed expansion  consolidation in existing markets through joint venturing or acquisition  de novo projects in existing and new markets  and acquisitions in new markets 
for the next two years  we will focus on growing our inpatient rehabilitation business 
once we reduce our leverage and have a balance sheet capable of withstanding additional risk  we will consider growth opportunities in other post acute services complementary to our existing services such as long term acute care  home health  and hospice 
in focusing on our inpatient rehabilitation business  we commenced or completed the following development projects we opened our second inpatient rehabilitation hospital in puerto rico in april in april  we signed an agreement to partner with wellmont health system wellmont to own and operate a new inpatient rehabilitation hospital in bristol  virginia and to partner with wellmont at our existing inpatient rehabilitation hospital in kingsport  tennessee 
although the certificate of need con application for the virginia hospital was denied on december   we have appealed this decision and meanwhile are continuing to operate the tennessee hospital on a stand alone basis 
we opened a new bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in fredericksburg  virginia in july we filed a con application for a new bed rehabilitation hospital in louden county  virginia on october   and have signed an agreement to acquire the property on which the hospital will be built 
regulatory challenges to the inpatient rehabilitation industry our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide services to patients who require intensive inpatient rehabilitative care 
inpatient rehabilitation patients typically experience significant physical disabilities due to various conditions  such as head injury  spinal cord injury  stroke  certain orthopedic problems  and neuromuscular disease 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide the medical  nursing  therapy  and ancillary services required to comply with local  state  and federal regulations  as well as accreditation standards of the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and  for some facilities  the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities 
over the last several years  changes in regulation governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created a challenging operating environment for inpatient rehabilitation services 
specifically  on may   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet the requirements of the rule would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
however  the impact of the rule was significantly greater than cms initially envisioned  and it required us to deny admissions to our hospitals 
the compliance threshold of the rule was in the process of being phased in over time  and was already at or higher for all of our hospitals at the end of however  on december   the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the medicare act was signed  permanently setting the compliance threshold at instead of  and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitation care under the rule 
we believe the freeze at the compliance threshold will stabilize much of the volatility in patient volumes created by the rule 
an additional element to the medicare act is a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of the medicare pricing roll back 
the roll back is effective from april  until september  the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold is positive  and we expect the negative impact of the pricing roll back to be offset by volume increases created by the fact that more patients now have access to our high quality inpatient rehabilitation services 
although the volume volatility created by the rule has had a significant negative impact on our net operating revenues over the past few years see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have been able to partially mitigate the impact of the rule on our operating earnings by implementing the following strategies refocused marketing 
the rule reduced the number of patients seeking treatment for orthopedic and other diagnostic conditions that we could accept in our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
consequently  we focused our marketing efforts on neurologists  neurosurgeons  and internists who could refer patients that require treatment for one of the designated medical conditions identified by the rule  such as stroke  spinal cord injury  brain injury  and various neurological disorders 
broadened services 
to make up for a potentially reduced inpatient rehabilitation patient census  we increased the number of other post acute care services performed at or complementary to our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  such as home health services 
reduced costs 
we aggressively reduced our costs in proportion to patient census declines in our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
competition the inpatient rehabilitation industry is highly fragmented  and we have no single  similar direct competitor 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units and skilled nursing units  many of which are within acute care hospitals in the markets we serve 
our ltchs compete with other ltchs or with intensive care units also within acute care hospitals in the markets we serve 
several smaller privately held companies are beginning to compete with us in select geographic markets in texas and the west 
in addition  there are public companies that operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and ltchs  but these are generally secondary services to their core businesses 
because of the attractiveness of the industry  other providers of post acute care services may also become competitors in the future 
for example  over the past few years  the number of nursing homes marketing themselves as rehabilitation providers has increased 
in some states where we operate  the construction or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  or the introduction of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory agencies under a certificate of need or con program 
see this item  regulation certificates of need 
we potentially face opposition any time we initiate a certificate of need project or seek to acquire an existing facility or certificate of need 
this opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed certificate of need project 
the necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition 
we have generally been successful in obtaining certificates of need or similar approvals when required  although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future 
we rely significantly on our ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses  therapists  and other clinical personnel for our hospitals 
we compete for these professionals with other health care companies  hospitals  and potential clients and partners 
in addition  the lifting by cms of the moratorium on new specialty hospitals has enabled physicians and others to open inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in direct competition with us  particularly in states in which a con is not required to build a hospital  which has made it more difficult and expensive to hire the necessary personnel for our hospitals 
sources of revenues we receive payment for patient care services from the federal government primarily under the medicare program  state governments under their respective medicaid or similar programs  managed care plans  private insurers  and directly from patients 
in addition  we receive payment for non patient care activities from various sources 
the following table identifies the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total revenues and receivables from government agencies have always been significant to our operations 
our focus on the post acute care sector and inpatient rehabilitation services subsequent to our divestiture transactions has increased this significance 
for example  prior to our divestitures  approximately of our net operating revenues related to patients participating in the medicare program as reported in our form k for the fiscal year ended december  and prior to the reclassification of our surgery centers  outpatient and diagnostic divisions to discontinued operations 
as can be seen in the table above  subsequent to our divestiture transactions and the associated reclassification of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions to discontinued operations  this percent increased to approximately of our net operating revenues 
unlike health care providers who rely heavily on managed care and other discount plans  we should always be able to participate in the medicare program  as long as we continue to maintain the required certifications as discussed below in the regulation section 
with managed care and other discount plans  health care providers may not be successful in negotiating contracts and may be unable to provide services to patients participating in those plans 
in addition  with medicare s prospective payment system  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  low cost providers 
our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services  including blue cross and blue shield bcbs  other private insurance companies  employers  health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos  and other managed care plans 
these discount programs  which are often negotiated for multi year terms  limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs 
patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  bcbs plans  hmos  or ppos  but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles  copayments  or coinsurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles  copayments  and coinsurance has been increasing each year 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
medicare reimbursement medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons  and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicaid is a jointly administered federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care 
medicare  through statutes and regulations  establishes reimbursement methodologies for various types of health care facilities and services 
these methodologies have historically been subject to periodic revisions that can have a substantial impact on existing health care providers 
in accordance with authorization from congress  cms generally makes annual upward or downward adjustments to medicare payment rates in most areas 
the medicare act includes a roll back in pricing for the period from april  through september   which will result in a decrease in actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases in costs 
we expect congress and cms will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of health care settings over the next several years 
any downward adjustment to rates for the types of facilities we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
a basic summary of current medicare reimbursement in our service areas follows inpatient rehabilitation and the rule 
on august   cms published a final rule that updates the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for the federal fiscal year covering discharges occurring on or after october  and on or before september  
specifically  the final rule included a market basket update of to the standard payment rate 
we estimated this final rule would have increased our net operating revenue by approximately million per quarter for federal fiscal year as compared to federal fiscal year however  due to the medicare pricing roll back effective from april  to september   we will only receive the benefits of the update in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as discussed previously in this item at inpatient rehabilitation business regulatory challenges to the inpatient rehabilitation industry  the medicare act recently amended the rule to permanently establish a compliance threshold  to include comorbidities as a qualifying factor  and to temporarily roll back the pricing of services 
although the refocus of admissions we undertook during the past few years resulted in volume volatility  it has resulted in our achieving full compliance with the compliance level during the freeze at should provide us with permanent relief from much of the volume volatility we have experienced since may  and should allow us to increase patient volumes going forward 
anticipated increases in patient revenues may be offset in the short term due to the medicare pricing roll back under the medicare act 
as noted above  this roll back applies to the period from april  through september  while the short term effect of this amendment will be the roll back of medicare pricing to the levels existing in the third quarter of  the long term effects of the medicare act will be positive due to the increased number of patients we will be able to serve 
although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent the most significant challenges to our business  coverage policies can also affect our operations 
for example  medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local level  that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
in the absence of a national coverage determination  local medicare contractors may specify more restrictive criteria than otherwise would apply nationally 
we cannot predict how these local coverage rules will affect us 
on december   the medicare modernization act of authorized cms to conduct a demonstration program known as the medicare recovery audit contractor rac program 
this demonstration was first initiated in three states california  florida  and new york and authorizes cms to contract with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits 
these audits are in addition to those conducted by existing medicare contractors  and the contracted racs are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered 
racs receive claims data directly from medicare contractors on a quarterly basis and  after october   are authorized to review claims up to three years from the date a claim was paid 
on december   the tax relief health care act of directed cms to expand the rac program to the rest of the country by we cannot predict how this new program will affect us 
outpatient services provided by our hospitals 
on november   cms issued a final rule that will update payments under the physician fee schedule beginning january  specifically  the rule would reduce the standard conversion factor by to 
further  the rule provided for a negative budget neutrality factor of to the work relative value unit 
these changes will result in lower reimbursement to us for outpatient services 
however  the medicare act amended the physician fee schedule pricing reduction to provide for an increase in the standard conversion factor of for the period january  through june  absent congressional intervention  the pricing reductions discussed above would be reinstated on july  long term acute care hospitals 
ltchs provide medical treatment to patients with chronic diseases and or complex medical conditions 
in order for a hospital to qualify as an ltch  patients discharged from the hospital in any given cost reporting year must have an average length of stay in excess of days  among other requirements 
ltchs are currently reimbursed under a prospective payment system ltch pps pursuant to which medicare classifies patients into distinct medicare severity diagnosis related groups ms ltc drgs based upon specific clinical characteristics and expected resource needs 
on may   cms issued final regulations that updated payment rates under the ltch pps for rate year  which are effective for discharges occurring on or after july  through june  this rule implements various payment changes and also indicates that a budget neutrality requirement will be implemented starting with the october  update to the ltc drgs  relative weights and average length of stays 
this rule also extended the hospital within hospital referral limitation to freestanding  satellite and grandfathered ltchs see this item  regulation hospital within hospital rules for a further discussion of this rule change 
this final rule did not materially impact our net operating revenues in  nor is it expected to materially impact our net operating revenues 
on august   cms issued final regulations that updated the inpatient hospital prospective payment system ipps and ltch pps 
the final rule implemented the ms ltc drg system by expanding the current number of drgs from to  resulting in changes to the ltch relative payment weights and average lengths of stay 
these changes were effective beginning october  this final rule is not expected to have a material impact on our net operating revenues during federal fiscal year however  the medicare act provides regulatory relief  for a three year period to ltchs to ensure continued access to current long term care hospital services  while also imposing a limited moratorium on the development of new long term care hospitals 
specifically  the legislation would freeze the market basket update for ltchs for the last quarter of rate year additionally  the medicare act would prevent cms from implementing the new payment provision for short stay outlier cases and the extension of the referral limitation to freestanding  satellite and grandfathered ltchs that was included in the rate year final rule 
see this item  regulation hospital within hospital rules for a further discussion of this rule 
medicaid reimbursement medicaid programs are jointly funded by federal and state governments 
as the medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of cms in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines  there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state 
many states have experienced shortfalls in their medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates 
additionally  certain states control medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of certain services 
continuing downward pressure on medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in our net operating revenues 
cost reports because of our participation in medicare  medicaid  and certain blue cross plans  we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs  and expenses associated with the services provided by our inpatient hospitals to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due healthsouth under these reimbursement programs 
these audits are used for determining if any under or over payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years 
the majority of our revenues are derived from prospective payment system payments  and even if we amend previously filed cost reports we do not expect the impact of those amendments to materially affect our results of operations 
managed care and other discount plans most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services  including managed care plans  bcbs  other private insurance companies  and employers 
managed care contracts typically have terms of between one and three years  although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year unless a party elects to terminate the contract 
while some of our contracts provide for annual rate increases of three to five percent  we cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases 
regulation the health care industry is subject to significant federal  state  and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided  requiring licensure or certification of our hospitals  regulating the use of our properties  and controlling our growth 
corporate integrity agreement on december   we entered into a corporate integrity agreement the cia with the hhs oig 
the cia has an effective date of january  and a term of five years from that effective date 
it incorporated a number of compliance program changes already implemented by us and required  among other things  that not later than days after the effective date we form an executive compliance committee made up of our compliance officer and other executive management members  which shall participate in the formulation and implementation of healthsouth s compliance program  require certain independent contractors to abide by our standards of business conduct  provide general compliance training to all healthsouth personnel as well as specialized training to personnel responsible for billing  coding  and cost reporting relating to federal health care programs  report and return overpayments received from federal health care programs  notify the hhs oig of any new investigations or legal proceedings initiated by a governmental entity involving an allegation of fraud or criminal conduct against healthsouth  notify the hhs oig of the purchase  sale  closure  establishment  or relocation of facilities furnishing items or services that are reimbursed under federal health care programs  and submit annual reports to the hhs oig regarding our compliance with the cia 
the cia also required that we engage an independent review organization iro to assist us in assessing and evaluating our billing  coding  and cost reporting practices with respect to our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  our billing and coding practices for outpatient items and services furnished by outpatient departments of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  and certain other obligations pursuant to the cia and the related settlement agreement 
we engaged pricewaterhousecoopers llp to serve as our iro 
on april   we submitted an implementation report to the hhs oig stating we had  within the day time frame  materially complied with the initial requirements of the cia 
since that time  we have reported annually to the hhs oig regarding our compliance with the cia  including the submission of an annual report by our iro 
as discussed in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we entered into a first addendum to our cia which requires additional compliance training and annual audits of billing practices relating to prosthetic and orthotic devices 
the addendum has a term of three years and will run concurrently with our existing five year cia 
on december   we entered into a second addendum to our cia  which requires additional compliance training and annual audits related to arrangements with referral sources 
this addendum also runs concurrently with our existing five year cia 
failure to meet our obligations under our cia could result in stipulated financial penalties 
failure to comply with material terms  however  could lead to exclusion from further participation in federal health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  which currently account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
licensure and certification health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal  state  and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  maintenance of adequate records  fire prevention  and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
our hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and non governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure 
all of our inpatient hospitals are currently required to be licensed 
in addition  hospitals must be certified by cms to participate in the medicare program and generally must be certified by medicaid state agencies to participate in medicaid programs 
all of our inpatient hospitals participate in or are awaiting the assignment of a provider number to participate in the medicare program 
our medicare certified hospitals undergo periodic on site surveys in order to maintain their certification 
failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals ineligible for medicare or medicaid reimbursement 
in addition  medicare or medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant facilities or otherwise impose sanctions on noncompliant facilities 
non governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if a facility loses its medicare or medicaid certification 
we have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities  however  given the complex nature of governmental health care regulations  there can be no assurance that medicare  medicaid  or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance 
certificates of need in some states where we operate  the construction or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  or the introduction of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory agencies under certificate of need laws 
certificate of need laws often require the reviewing agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services 
certificate of need laws generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  ltchs  and acute care hospitals  if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds 
in addition  the certificate of need laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity commitments as a condition for approving a certificate of need 
any time a certificate of need is required  we must obtain it before acquiring  opening  reclassifying  or expanding a health care facility or starting a new health care program 
false claims act over the past several years  an increasing number of health care providers have been accused of violating the federal false claims act 
that act prohibits the knowing presentation of a false claim to the united states government  and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to  per claim 
in addition  the false claims act allows private persons  known as relators  to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints 
because of the sealing provisions of the false claims act  it is possible for health care providers to be subject to false claims act suits for extended periods of time without notice of such suits or an opportunity to respond to them 
because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations  a billing error or cost reporting error could result in significant civil or criminal penalties under the false claims act or other laws 
due to the actions of prior management  we have entered into substantial settlements of claims under the false claims act  as discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  certain regulatory actions 
see also note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
relationships with physicians and other providers the anti kickback law 
various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of health care services  including employment or service contracts and investment relationships 
among the most important of these restrictions is a federal criminal law prohibiting the offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the medicare or medicaid programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering  arranging for  or recommending the lease  purchase  or order of any item  good  facility  or service covered by such programs the anti kickback law 
in addition to federal criminal sanctions  including penalties of up to  for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims  violators of the anti kickback law may be subject to exclusion from the medicare and or medicaid programs 
in  the hhs oig issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the anti kickback law the safe harbor rules 
the safe harbor rules create certain standards safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that  if fully complied with  assure participants in the particular arrangement that the hhs oig will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the anti kickback law or as the basis for an exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions 
the hhs oig closely scrutinizes health care joint ventures involving physicians and other referral sources for compliance with the anti kickback law 
in  the hhs oig published a fraud alert that outlined questionable features of suspect joint ventures  and has continued to rely on such fraud alert in later pronouncements 
we currently operate some of our rehabilitation hospitals as general partnerships  limited partnerships  or limited liability companies collectively  partnerships with third party investors  including other institutional health care providers but also including  in one case  physician investors 
some of these partners may be deemed to be in a position to make or influence referrals to our hospitals 
those partnerships that are providers of services under the medicare program  and their owners  are subject to the anti kickback law 
a number of the relationships we have established with physicians and other health care providers do not fit within any of the safe harbors 
the safe harbor rules do not expand the scope of activities the anti kickback law prohibits  nor do they provide that failure to fall within a safe harbor constitutes a violation of the anti kickback law  however  the hhs oig has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny 
while we do not believe our rehabilitation hospital partnerships engage in activities that violate the anti kickback law  there can be no assurance such violations may not be asserted in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our defense against any such assertion would be successful 
we have entered into agreements to manage many of our hospitals that are owned by partnerships 
most of these agreements incorporate a percentage based management fee 
although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts  this safe harbor requires  among other things  the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance 
because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues  the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement 
however  we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and they comply with the anti kickback law 
the hhs oig has taken the position that percentage based management agreements are not protected by a safe harbor  and consequently  may violate the anti kickback law 
on april   the hhs oig issued advisory opinion which reiterates this position 
this opinion focused on areas the hhs oig considers problematic in a physician practice management context  including financial incentives to increase patient referrals  no safeguards against overutilization  and incentives to increase the risk of abusive billing 
the opinion reiterated that proof of intent to violate the anti kickback law is the central focus of the hhs oig 
we have implemented programs designed to safeguard against overbilling and otherwise to achieve compliance with the anti kickback law and other laws  but there can be no assurance the hhs oig would find our compliance programs to be adequate 
while several federal court decisions have aggressively applied the restrictions of the anti kickback law  they provide little guidance as to the application of the anti kickback law to our partnerships  and we cannot provide any assurances a federal or state agency charged with enforcement of the anti kickback law and similar laws might not claim some of our partnerships have violated or are violating the anti kickback law 
such a claim could adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or other health care providers or result in the imposition of penalties on us or on particular healthsouth hospitals 
any conviction of a partnership for violations of the anti kickback law would have severe consequences on that partnership s ability to be a viable entity and our ability to attract investors to other partnerships and could result in substantial fines as well as our exclusion from medicare and medicaid 
moreover  even the assertion of a violation of the anti kickback law by one or more of our partnerships could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
stark exceptions 
the stark provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amend the federal medicare statute to prohibit the making by a physician of referrals for designated health services including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  physical therapy  occupational therapy  radiology services  or radiation therapy  to an entity in which the physician has an investment interest or other financial relationship  subject to certain exceptions 
such prohibition took effect on january  and applies to our partnerships with physician partners and to our other financial relationships with physicians 
final phase i stark regulations were published in the federal register on january  and had an effective date of january  final phase ii stark regulations were published in the federal register on march  and had an effective date of july  final phase iii stark regulations were published in the federal register on september   and had an effective date of december  the final regulations substantially clarified compensation arrangements with physicians and recruitment arrangements among health care facilities  individual physicians  and group practices 
while we do not believe our financial relationships with physicians violate the stark statute or the associated regulations  no assurances can be given that a federal or state agency charged with enforcement of the stark statute and regulations or similar state laws might not assert a contrary position or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships  or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships  might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us or on particular healthsouth hospitals 
even the assertion of a violation could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  a number of states have passed or are considering statutes which prohibit or limit physician referrals of patients to facilities in which they have an investment interest 
any actual or perceived violation of these state statutes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
hipaa also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by medicare beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services 
in addition  hipaa created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including the medicare integrity program  and an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to  for providing information on medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least of medicare funds 
federal enforcement officials now have the ability to exclude from medicare and medicaid any investors  officers  and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud  even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud 
hipaa also contains certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
hhs has issued regulations implementing the hipaa administrative simplification provisions and compliance with these regulations became mandatory for our hospitals on october  although hhs temporarily agreed to accept noncompliant medicare claims  cms stopped processing non hipaa compliant medicare claims beginning october  we believe that the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
hipaa also requires hhs to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health related information 
hhs released regulations containing privacy standards in december and published revisions to the regulations in august compliance with these regulations became mandatory on april  the privacy regulations regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information  whether communicated electronically  on paper  or orally 
the regulations also provide patients with significant new rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed 
hhs released security regulations on february  the security regulations became mandatory on april  and require health care providers to implement administrative  physical  and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically 
the privacy regulations and security regulations have increased costs on our hospitals in order to comply with these standards 
penalties for violations of hipaa include civil and criminal monetary penalties 
in addition  there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns 
facilities will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these statutes vary and could impose additional penalties 
hospital within hospital rules effective october   cms enacted final regulations that provide if a long term acute care hospital within hospital has medicare admissions from its host hospital that exceed or an adjusted percentage for certain rural or metropolitan statistical area msa dominant hospitals of its medicare discharges for its cost reporting period  the ltch will receive an adjusted payment for its medicare patients of the lesser of the otherwise full payment under the ltch pps or a comparable payment that medicare would pay under the acute care inpatient prospective payment system 
in determining whether an ltch meets the criterion  patients transferred from the host hospital that have already qualified for outlier payments at the acute host facility would not count as part of the host hospital s allowable percentage 
cases admitted from the host hospital before the ltch crosses the threshold will be paid under the ltch pps 
under the final regulation  this rule is being phased in over a four year period which began on october  on may   cms published a final rule that would extend the hospital within hospital patient threshold to freestanding  satellite and grandfathered ltchs 
these new ltch requirements are phased in over a year period beginning with cost report periods beginning on or after july  the first year of the phase in would limit referrals to the lesser of or the percentage of referrals in the cost report period ending in rate year upon completion of the full phase in  rural  urban single and msa dominant ltchs shall not be subject to any payment adjustment if no more than of the hospital s medicare discharges are admitted from a co located hospital 
urban ltch hospitals shall not be subject to any payment adjustment if no more than of the hospital s medicare discharges are admitted from a co located hospital 
the medicare act made certain changes to the hospital within hospital rules 
specifically  the bill would prevent application of the patient threshold payment adjustment to freestanding  satellite  and grandfathered ltchs 
further  the bill increases the percentage that hospital within hospital ltchs may admit from a co located hospital 
rural  urban single and msa dominant ltch hospitals shall not be subject to any payment adjustment if no more than of the hospital s medicare discharges are admitted from another hospital 
urban ltch hospitals shall not be subject to any payment adjustment if no more than of the hospital s medicare discharges are admitted from another hospital 
these provisions are effective for cost report periods beginning on or after december  for a three year period 
additionally  other excluded hospitals or units of a host hospital  such as inpatient rehabilitation facilities and or units  must meet certain hospital within hospital requirements in order to maintain their excluded status and not be subject to ipps 
risk management and insurance we insure a substantial portion of our professional  general liability  and workers compensation risks through a self insured retention program underwritten by our wholly owned offshore captive insurance subsidiary  hcs limited hcs  which we fund annually 
for  hcs provided our first layer of insurance coverage for professional and general liability risks and workers compensation claims 
we maintained professional and general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by hcs 
healthsouth and hcs maintained reserves for professional  general liability  and workers compensation risks 
management considers such reserves  which are based on actuarially determined estimates  to be adequate for those liability risks 
however  there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed management s estimates 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  self insured risks  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these reserves 
we also maintain director and officer  property  and other typical insurance coverages with unrelated commercial carriers 
our director and officer liability insurance coverage for our current officers and directors includes coverage for individual directors and officers in circumstances where we are legally or financially unable to indemnify these individuals 
examples of a company s inability to indemnify would include judgments in connection with shareholder derivative lawsuits  bankruptcy financial restraints  and claims that are against public policy 
within our coverage  we have a self insured retention for indemnifiable loss 
see note  settlements  insurance coverage litigation  for a description of various lawsuits that have been filed to contest coverage under certain directors and officers insurance policies 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately  were full time employees 
we are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages  hours  benefits  and other terms and conditions relating to employment 
except for approximately employees at one inpatient rehabilitation hospital about of that hospital s workforce  none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we are not aware of any current activities to organize our employees at other hospitals 
we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 
like most health care providers  our labor costs are rising faster than the general inflation rate 
in some markets  the lack of availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to health care providers 
to address this challenge  we are implementing initiatives to improve retention  recruiting  compensation programs  and productivity 
the shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel  including physical therapists  may require us to increase utilization of more expensive temporary personnel

risk factors our business  operations  and financial position are subject to various risks 
some of these risks are described below  and you should take such risks into account in evaluating healthsouth or any investment decision involving healthsouth 
this section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to our company  our industry  or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors 
more detailed information concerning the risk factors described below is contained in other sections of this annual report 
we are highly leveraged 
as a consequence  a down turn in earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement and could impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary 
although we improved our leverage and liquidity during  we remain highly leveraged 
as discussed in item  business  recent significant events  we reduced our long term debt from billion to approximately billion during we believe the reduction in our long term debt has eliminated significant uncertainty regarding our capital structure  improved our financial position  increased our liquidity and enhanced our operational flexibility 
based on the current borrowing capacity and leverage ratio required under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
a down turn in earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement and impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms as favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
the recent tightening in the credit markets will make additional financing more expensive and difficult to obtain 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement 
certain trends in our business  including acute care volume weakness and pricing pressure  have created a challenging operating environment  and future changes could place additional pressure on our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  we are subject to numerous contingent liabilities  to prevailing economic conditions  and to financial  business  and other factors beyond our control 
although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions  we cannot assure you that changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying obligations under our debt 
reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third party payors and other regulatory changes affecting our industry could adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our net operating revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
see item  business  sources of revenues  for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues 
historically  congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the health care system 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on and  in some cases  significant reductions in the levels of  payments to health care providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
the recent medicare act has frozen the increase in medicare payments to inpatient rehabilitation hospitals from april  through september  if we are not able to increase our volumes sufficiently to offset this price reduction  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our results could be further adversely affected by other changes in laws or regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as possible changes to or expansion of the audit processes conducted by medicare contractors or medicare recovery audit contractors 
for a discussion of the rule and other factors affecting reimbursement for our services  see item  business  sources of revenues medicare reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures from many third party payors to control health care costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
our relationships with managed care and non governmental third party payors  such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  are generally governed by negotiated agreements 
these agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third party payors 
additionally  our third party payors may  from time to time  request audits of the amounts paid to us under our agreements with them 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if the audits uncover substantial overpayments made to us 
competition for staffing may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our management and medical support personnel  such as physical therapists  nurses  and other health care professionals 
we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals 
in some markets  the lack of availability of physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to health care providers 
this shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
if our labor costs increase  we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs 
because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed  prospective payments  our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited 
our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel  or to control our labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the adoption of more restrictive medicare coverage policies at the national or local levels could have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain medicare reimbursement for inpatient rehabilitation services 
medicare providers also can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local levels  describing whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
in the absence of a national coverage determination  local medicare contractors and carriers may specify more restrictive criteria than otherwise would apply nationally 
for instance  cahaba government benefit administrators  the medicare contractor for many of our hospitals  has issued a local coverage determination setting forth very detailed criteria for determining the medical appropriateness of services provided by inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
we cannot predict whether other medicare contractors will adopt additional local coverage determinations or other policies or how these will affect us 
if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement  or if the hhs oig determines we have violated federal laws governing kickbacks and self referrals  we could be subject to severe sanctions  including substantial civil money penalties 
in december  we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the united states department of health and human services hhs office of the inspector general hhs oig to promote our compliance with the requirements of medicare  medicaid  and all other federal health care programs 
we have also entered into two addendums to this agreement 
under the agreement and addendums  which are effective for five years from january   we are subject to certain administrative requirements and are subject to review of certain medicare cost reports and reimbursement claims by an independent review organization 
our failure to comply with the material terms of the corporate integrity agreement could lead to suspension or exclusion from further participation in federal health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  which currently account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
further  if the hhs oig determines that we have violated the anti kickback law or the federal stark statute s general prohibition on physician self referrals  we may be subject to significant civil monetary penalties  and may be excluded from further participation in federal health care programs 
any of these sanctions would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to health care providers  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
as a health care provider  we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these laws and regulations relate to  among other things licensure  certification  and accreditation  coding and billing for services  requirements of the compliance threshold  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  including physician self referral and anti kickback laws  quality of medical care  use and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment  maintenance and security of medical records  acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  and disposal of medical and hazardous waste 
in the future  changes in these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our investment structure  facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs  operating procedures  and contractual arrangements 
although we have invested substantial time  effort  and expense in implementing internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties  including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals  and exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state health care programs 
our hospitals face national  regional  and local competition for patients from other health care providers 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
although we are the largest provider of rehabilitative health care services  in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that this competition  or other competition which we may encounter in the future  will not adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  weakening certificate of need laws in some states could potentially increase competition in those states 
we remain a defendant in a number of lawsuits  and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases  the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we have settled the major litigation pending against us  we remain a defendant in numerous lawsuits which are discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our principal executive offices are located in birmingham  alabama  where  as of december   we owned and maintained a headquarters building of approximately  square feet located on an acre corporate campus 
in addition to our headquarters building  as of december   we leased or owned business locations through various consolidated entities to support our operations 
our hospital leases  which represent the largest portion of our rent expense  generally have initial terms of years 
most of our leases contain one or more options to extend the lease period for up to five additional years for each option 
our consolidated entities are generally responsible for property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and routine maintenance expenses  particularly in our leased hospitals 
other than our headquarters campus and a contiguous acre tract of land that includes an incomplete story building formerly called the digital hospital  none of our other properties is materially important 
we and those of our subsidiaries that are guarantors under our credit agreement as defined in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements have pledged substantially all of our property as collateral to secure the performance of our obligations under our credit agreement

prior to  we marketed the digital hospital for sale extensively as a hospital but were unable to find a buyer 
following the march  sale of our acute care hospital located in birmingham  alabama  we no longer owned the certificate of need that would enable us to market the digital hospital as a hospital 
see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of the impairment charges we recognized in   and relating to the digital hospital 
in january  we entered into an agreement to sell our corporate campus  including the digital hospital  to daniel corporation  a birmingham based  full service real estate organization for million in cash and a residual interest in the digital hospital 
under the terms of the agreement  we entered into a long term lease arrangement to maintain our corporate headquarters on the corporate campus 
the transaction is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter of see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during  in transactions other than the divestitures of our outpatient  surgery centers  and diagnostic divisions and other sales of operating facilities  we sold non core properties and buildings for net proceeds of million 
additionally  on october   we closed a transaction for the property associated with our new hospital in fredericksburg  virginia 
we received net proceeds of million in this transaction and entered into a lease with a base term of years for the property 
our headquarters  hospitals  and other properties are suitable for their respective uses and are  in general  adequate for our present needs 
our properties are subject to various federal  state  and local statutes and ordinances regulating their operation 
management does not believe compliance with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

as a result of our adoption of this statement  our results of operations for and included approximately million and million of compensation expense related to stock options 
these costs are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and as discussed in more detail in note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we were involved in a legal dispute regarding the lease of braintree rehabilitation hospital in braintree  massachusetts and new england rehabilitation hospital in woburn  massachusetts 
in  a judgment was entered against us that upheld the landlord s termination of our lease of these two hospitals and placed us as the manager  rather than the owner  of these two hospitals 
accordingly  our and results of operations include only the million and million management fee we earned for operating these hospitals during the nine months ended september  and the year ended december   respectively 
in and  the results of operations of these two hospitals were included in our consolidated statements of operations on a gross basis

the impairment of the digital hospital in each year was determined using either its estimated fair value based on the estimated net proceeds we expected to receive in a sale transaction or using a weighted average fair value approach that considered an alternative use appraisal and other potential scenarios 
the remainder of the impairment charges in each period relate to long lived assets at various hospitals that were examined for impairment due to hospitals experiencing negative cash flow from operations 
we determined the fair value of the impaired long lived assets at a hospital primarily based on the assets estimated fair value using valuation techniques that included discounted future cash flows and third party appraisals

executive overview as described in item  business  we have spent considerable effort in strategically repositioning healthsouth through divestitures and debt reduction  both of which reinforce our role as the nation s preeminent provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
in we entered into an agreement with select medical corporation select medical  a privately owned operator of specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation facilities  to sell our outpatient rehabilitation division for approximately million in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
this transaction closed on may   other than with respect to certain facilities for which approvals for the transfer to select medical had not yet been received as of such date 
subsequent to closing  we received approval and transferred the remaining facilities to select medical 
we entered into an agreement to sell our surgery centers division to asc acquisition llc asc  a delaware limited liability company and newly formed affiliate of tpg partners v  lp tpg  a private investment partnership 
the purchase price consisted of cash consideration of million  subject to certain adjustments  and a contingent option to acquire up to a equity interest of the new company 
this transaction closed on june   other than with respect to certain facilities for which approvals for the transfer to asc had not yet been received as of such date 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we received approval and transferred a portion of these facilities  but others remained pending as of december  we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of the gores group  a private equity firm  to sell our diagnostic division for approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
this transaction closed on july   other than with respect to one facility for which approval for the transfer had not yet been received as of such date 
we settled all federal income tax issues outstanding with the internal revenue services the irs for the tax years through  and the joint committee of congress reviewed and approved the associated tax refunds due to the company 
in october  we received a total cash refund of approximately million  including million of federal income tax refunds and million of associated interest 
we used the net proceeds from our divestitures and the majority of our federal income tax recovery to reduce our total debt outstanding from billion as of december  to billion as of december  this decrease in average borrowings year over year reduced our interest expense by approximately million in compared to we made the final payments under our medicare program settlement and united states securities and exchange commission sec settlement see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we settled certain matters with the united states department of health and human services hhs office of the inspector general hhs oig which previously had been self disclosed in by agreeing to pay a penalty in the amount of million 
we paid million of this penalty in the fourth quarter of and will pay the remaining million in the first quarter of in addition to our own accomplishments in  new legislation was signed into law on december  that permanently set the compliance threshold for the rule at  which gives permanent relief from the primary regulatory uncertainties that had faced the company and its industry for the past few years see the regulatory challenges to the inpatient rehabilitation industry section below 
with this regulatory uncertainty resolved  our repositioning complete  and our deleveraging plan on track  we are well positioned for the future 
changes to the historic presentation of our financial statements as a result of the divestitures discussed above  our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions are reported as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these transactions 
in addition  we historically reported five segments inpatient  surgery centers  outpatient  diagnostic  and corporate and other 
based on our strategic focus in the inpatient rehabilitation industry and the reclassification of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions to discontinued operations  we modified our segment reporting from five reportable segments to one reportable segment in the first quarter of amounts historically reported as part of our corporate and other segment  which primarily represented the corporate overhead costs associated with our operating divisions  are no longer considered a reportable segment by our chief operating decision maker due to our strategic repositioning as a pure play post acute care provider and the change in the manner in which we now manage the company 
rather  these corporate overhead costs are now presented on the line entitled general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the consolidated results of operations of the company presented herein represent the continuing operations of our inpatient division  including corporate overhead 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies  reclassifications  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
regulatory challenges to the inpatient rehabilitation industry over the last several years  changes in regulation governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created a challenging operating environment for inpatient rehabilitation services 
specifically  on may   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet the requirements of the rule would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
however  the impact of the rule was significantly greater than cms initially envisioned  and it required us to deny admissions to our hospitals 
the compliance threshold of the rule was in the process of being phased in over time  and was already at or higher for all of our hospitals at the end of however  on december   the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the medicare act was signed  permanently setting the compliance threshold at instead of  and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitation care under the rule 
we believe the freeze at the compliance threshold will stabilize much of the volatility in patient volumes created by the rule 
an additional element to the medicare act is a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of the medicare pricing roll back 
the roll back is effective from april  until september  the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold is positive  and we expect the negative impact of the pricing roll back to be offset by volume increases created by the fact that more patients now have access to our high quality inpatient rehabilitation services 
see item  business  for additional information regarding industry regulations 
our business we are the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitation hospital services in terms of revenues  number of hospitals  and patients treated 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide comprehensive services to patients who require intensive institutional rehabilitation care 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by a physician order 
internal case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation of patient status  achievement of goals  functional outcomes  and efficiency 
we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and long term acute care hospitals ltchs and provide treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis 
as of december   we operated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals including hospitals which we account for using the equity method of accounting  freestanding ltchs  outpatient satellites located within or near and operated by our hospitals  and home health agencies 
in addition to healthsouth hospitals  we manage inpatient rehabilitation units  outpatient satellites  and one gamma knife radiosurgery center through management contracts 
our inpatient hospitals are located in states  with a concentration of hospitals in texas  pennsylvania  florida  tennessee  and alabama 
as of december   we also had two hospitals in puerto rico  one of which began accepting patients in april net patient revenues from our hospitals increased by from to due primarily to an increase in our patient case mix index and compliant case growth  both of which increased our revenue per discharge 
operating earnings as defined in note  quarterly data unaudited  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements increased by approximately million during due to the increased revenues discussed above and decreased professional fees 
see the results of operations section of this item for additional information 
key challenges while we achieved significant milestones in  we continue to face challenges  including leverage and liquidity 
we are highly leveraged 
our high leverage increases our cost of borrowing and decreases our net income 
however  our leverage and liquidity are improving 
during  we used the net proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  as well as the majority of our federal income tax recovery  to pay down debt 
we also used available cash and borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem approximately million of our senior notes due  which carry a higher interest rate than borrowings under our credit agreement 
as a result of these transactions  our total debt outstanding has decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  we have scheduled principal payments of million and million in and related to long term debt obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we made the final payments related to our medicare program settlement and sec settlement see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
with these settlement payments behind us  we are now able to redirect our operating cash elsewhere in the company 
in addition  we expect to use cash flows from the expected sale of our corporate campus see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the receipt of additional federal and state income tax refunds to further reduce our long term debt outstanding 
however  no assurances can be given as to whether or when such cash flows will be received 
based on our current borrowing capacity and leverage ratio required under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
as with any company carrying significant debt  our primary risk relating to our high leverage is the possibility that a down turn in operating earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms as favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement 
for additional information regarding our leverage and liquidity  see the liquidity and capital resources section of this item and note  liquidity  and note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
reimbursement 
historically  congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the health care system 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on and  in some cases  significant reductions in the levels of payments to health care providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
for example  and as discussed below  while the freeze at the compliance threshold under the medicare act is a long term positive for us  the pricing roll back is a short term negative in and because medicare comprises approximately of our net operating revenues for the year ended december   single payor exposure and any potential legislative changes present risks to us 
also  because we receive a significant percentage of our revenues from medicare  our inability to achieve continued compliance with the threshold under the medicare act could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition to government payors  our relationships with managed care and non governmental third party payors are generally governed by negotiated agreements 
these agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services 
if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with these payors  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
staffing 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our management and medical support personnel  such as physical therapists  nurses  and other health care professionals 
if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management  physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel  or to control our labor costs  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
the lack of availability of physical therapists  nurses  and other medical support personnel continues to plague our company and the industry 
this shortage has required  and continues to require  us to enhance wages and increase our use of higher priced contract labor 
because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed  prospective payments  our ability to pass along these increased costs is limited 
this will be especially true during the and pricing roll back period under the medicare act  as discussed above 
we are focused on finding a long term solution for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for our hospitals 
as discussed in more detail in the business outlook section below  we are making an investment  in the form of enhanced benefits programs  in our employees in in an effort to reduce turnover at our hospitals and attract qualified health care professionals to our business 
business outlook with our turnaround and divestitures complete and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the rule resolved  our focus is now on executing our strategic plan and growing earnings per share 
we can now focus entirely on operating our hospitals and growing our inpatient rehabilitation business 
we believe the demand for inpatient rehabilitation services will increase as the us population ages 
in addition  medicare compliant cases are expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future  creating an attractive market 
we believe these market factors align with our strengths and focus in inpatient rehabilitative care 
unlike an acute care hospital that may offer inpatient rehabilitation as one of many secondary services  inpatient rehabilitation is our core business 
strategic outlook as the nation s largest provider of inpatient rehabilitation services  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on the quality of our clinical protocols  our broad base of clinical experience  our ability to create and leverage rehabilitative technology  and our ability to standardize practices and take advantage of efficiencies that result in cost effective  high quality care for our patients 
in and  we will ensure the operational initiatives we have launched over the past few years from the building of our internal audit function and development of our internal control structure to our teamworks initiative  as discussed below remain and or become fully embedded at our hospitals and in our overall corporate culture  as it is these operational initiatives that allow us to continue providing high quality care to our patients and set the platform for future growth 
we will seek growth by expanding our market share in existing markets  building new hospitals in new markets  and acquiring or joint venturing with competitors 
however  given the current credit markets and our leverage compared to other health care providers  we recognize that paying down debt and the continued deleveraging of the company is important and may take precedence over immediate growth opportunities 
however  there are ways to expand that require minimal initial cash outlays  such as joint ventures and other transactions  and should allow us to use the majority of our free cash flow for debt reduction 
operating outlook in  we launched a multi year operational initiative designed to identify best practices in a number of key areas and standardize those practices across all our hospitals 
this initiative is known as teamworks 
during the start up phase of this project  we chose two areas as our initial focus sales and marketing 
increasing the number of patient discharges is critical to maintaining and improving our profitability  particularly in light of the high percentage of fixed costs at our hospitals and the medicare pricing roll back discussed earlier 
non clinical support costs 
over the past few years  we have tightly managed the non clinical expenses of our hospitals due to the regulatory uncertainty that was caused by the rule and rising employee costs resulting from shortages of therapists and nurses 
although we have generally reduced most categories of expenses  there is a high degree of variability from hospital to hospital 
as a result  the non clinical support costs project was chosen in order to further standardize our best practices in this area 
in  we expect to complete the implementation of the above two areas  and we will begin looking at ways we can improve our retention and increase the productivity of our most valuable asset our employees 
we understand and recognize the importance our employees play in helping us reach our goals 
with this in mind  along with our desire to reduce turnover at our hospitals  we made an investment in our people in by increasing the employer matching contributions to our k savings plan  providing benefits to part time employees which we have never done before  and enhancing the benefits provided under certain medical plans without passing the costs of such enhancements to our employees 
we believe we can build on this investment as we examine our clinical productivity and human capital going forward as part of the teamworks initiative 
pricing will be flat to slightly down in due to the pricing roll back resulting from the medicare act the pricing roll back is effective from april  until september  and the significance of medicare as a payor to our net operating revenues 
however  we expect the freeze at the compliance threshold resulting from the medicare act  as well as our teamworks initiative  to result in a year over year increase in patient discharges in while increasing our volumes will be important in  generating free cash flow to further reduce our debt will also be a major operational focus 
in summary  we are focused on building volumes and improving the overall effectiveness of our operations 
on a go forward basis  we anticipate we will be able to generate cash flows to fund debt pre payments and our growth strategy  with the primary emphasis in being debt reduction 
however  we believe we can bring immediate and sustainable growth and return to our stockholders 
we are the new healthsouth  and we are well positioned to meet the challenges in this industry in and going forward 
results of operations during   and  we derived consolidated net operating revenues from the following payor sources for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our payor mix is weighted heavily towards medicare 
our hospitals receive medicare reimbursements under the prospective payment system applicable to inpatient rehabilitation facilities irf pps 
under irf pps  our hospitals receive fixed payment amounts per discharge based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services 
with irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  low cost providers 
for additional information regarding medicare reimbursement  please see the sources of revenues section of item  business 
the percent of our net operating revenues attributable to medicare has decreased over the past few years due to an increase in managed medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in the managed care and other discount plans and other third party payors categories in the above chart 
as part of the balanced budget act of  congress created a program of private  managed health care coverage for medicare beneficiaries 
this program has been referred to as medicare part c  medicare choice  or medicare advantage 
the program offers beneficiaries a range of medicare coverage options by providing a choice between the traditional fee for service program under medicare parts a and b or enrollment in a health maintenance organization  preferred provider organization  point of service plan  provider sponsored organization or an insurance plan operated in conjunction with a medical savings account 
while we expect our payor mix will remain heavily weighted towards medicare  we expect this shift in medicare patients into managed medicare and private fee for service plans to continue 
due to the significance of medicare payments to our hospitals  the number of patient discharges is a key metric utilized by management to monitor and evaluate our performance 
the number of outpatient visits is also tracked in order to measure the volume of outpatient activity each period 
certain financial results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
such reclassifications include the qualification of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions as assets held for sale and discontinued operations under fasb statement no 
 as well as four ltchs  our electro shock wave lithotripter units  and one other entity we closed or sold in that also qualified under fasb statement no 
we reclassified our consolidated balance sheet as of december  to show the assets and liabilities of these qualifying divisions and facilities as held for sale 
we also reclassified our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and to show the results of those qualifying divisions and facilities as discontinued operations 
in addition  we reclassified certain expenses considered to be corporate overhead historically reported primarily within the lines entitled salaries and benefits and other operating expenses into general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
these expenses primarily include administrative expenses such as corporate accounting  internal controls  legal  and information technology services 
because we did not allocate corporate overhead by division  our operating results reflect overhead costs associated with managing and providing shared services to our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  through their respective dates of sale  even though these divisions qualify as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses approximated of consolidated net operating revenues 
however  this percentage decreases by basis points if you include the revenues of the divisions and facilities reported in discontinued operations 
we plan to continue to rationalize our general and administrative expenses in relation to the size of our operations post repositioning in as discussed in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  due to the requirements under our credit agreement to use the net proceeds from each divestiture to repay obligations outstanding under our credit agreement  and in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 allocation of interest to discontinued operations  we allocated the interest expense on the debt that was required to be repaid as a result of the divestiture transactions to discontinued operations

full time equivalents included in the above table represent those who participate in or support the operations of our hospitals 
net operating revenues our consolidated net operating revenues consist primarily of revenues derived from patient care services 
net operating revenues also include other revenues generated from management and administrative fees  operation of the conference center located on our corporate campus  and other non patient care services 
these other revenues approximated   and of consolidated net operating revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net patient revenue from our hospitals was higher for the year ended december  than the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our patient case mix index and compliant case growth  both of which increased our revenue per discharge 
inpatient volumes were relatively flat year over year due primarily to nine hospitals that moved from a compliance threshold to a compliance threshold under the rule on july  discharges for the year were also negatively impacted by of our hospitals that moved from a compliance threshold to a compliance threshold under the rule on june  increased revenues attributable to our inpatient hospitals were offset by decreased revenues from outpatient visits 
decreased outpatient volumes resulted from the closure of outpatient satellites  changes in patient program mix  shortages in therapy staffing  and continued competition from physicians offering physical therapy services within their own offices 
as of december   we operated outpatient satellites  while as of december   we operated outpatient satellites 
net patient revenue from our hospitals was lower in than in due primarily to a reduction of non compliant case volumes that resulted from the continued phase in of the rule 
in  our hospitals were required to operate at a compliance threshold under the rule 
in  the minimum compliance threshold increased to causing reductions of non compliant case volumes 
we also experienced a decrease in outpatient volumes from to due to the decrease in our inpatient volumes  as well as the reasons discussed above for the decrease in outpatient volumes from to certain regulatory pricing changes implemented as of october  also negatively impacted net operating revenues for the first three quarters of as discussed in the executive overview business outlook section of this item  we expect pricing will be flat to slightly down in due to the pricing roll back resulting from the medicare act and the significance of medicare as a payor to our net operating revenues 
however  we expect the freeze at the compliance threshold resulting from the medicare act  as well as our teamworks initiative  to result in a year over year increase in discharges in salaries and benefits salaries and benefits represent the most significant cost to us and include all amounts paid to full and part time employees who directly participate in or support the operations of our hospitals  including all related costs of benefits provided to employees 
it also includes amounts paid for contract labor 
salaries and benefits increased in each year presented 
annual merit increases given to employees in each year contributed to the increase 
in addition  shortages of therapists and nurses caused us to raise salaries to retain current employees and to increase our utilization of higher priced contract labor to properly care for our patients in each year 
finally  as a result of our efforts to comply with the rule  in each year  we increasingly treated higher acuity patients  which resulted in increased labor costs 
we are focused on finding a long term solution for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for our hospitals 
we will continue to monitor the labor market  and we will make any necessary adjustments in order to remain competitive in this highly competitive environment 
as discussed in the executive overview business outlook section of this item  in an effort to address our recruiting and retention concerns  we made certain enhancements to our benefits programs in january other operating expenses other operating expenses include costs associated with managing and maintaining our hospitals 
these expenses include such items as repairs and maintenance  utilities  contract services  professional fees  and insurance 
in and  we experienced a reduction in self insurance costs driven by current claims history and revised actuarial estimates that resulted from fewer full time equivalents and our exit from the acute care business 
these reductions are primarily included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and other operating expenses were higher in than in now that we are a pure play provider of post acute health care services  we are able to focus exclusively on the operations of our hospitals 
as part of this focus  during  we incurred professional fees with a consulting firm associated with our teamworks initiative described earlier in this item 
also  as discussed in more detail in note  related party transactions  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  other operating expenses for the year ended december  included a million gain related to the repayment of a formerly fully reserved note receivable from source medical solutions  inc source medical 
other operating expenses were lower in compared to due to declining inpatient volumes  decreased fees associated with the use of accounting and consulting firms during our reconstruction and restatement process in  the source medical gain recorded in  and the reduction in self insurance expenses discussed above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include administrative expenses such as corporate accounting  internal controls  legal  and information technology services that are managed from our corporate headquarters in birmingham  alabama 
these expenses include the salaries and benefits of   and full time equivalents for the years ended december    and  respectively  who perform these administrative functions 
in addition  because we did not allocate corporate overhead by division  our general and administrative expenses include costs associated with managing and providing shared services to our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  through their respective dates of sale  even though these divisions qualify as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses approximated of consolidated net operating revenues 
however  this percentage decreases by basis points if you include the revenues of the divisions reported in discontinued operations 
until we are able to rationalize our corporate overhead in relation to the size of our operations now that our divestitures are complete  our general and administrative expenses will reflect unusually high costs 
our general and administrative expenses were lower in compared to due to the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions in the second and third quarters of see the executive overview section of this item for more information on the timing of each divestiture 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses resulting from our divestiture transactions was offset by our investment in a development function and costs associated with installing new accounting systems 
also  given the uncertainty surrounding our repositioning efforts in the first half of  we experienced attrition of corporate employees who supported our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions 
as this attrition occurred  we chose to utilize higher priced contract labor to temporarily fill certain corporate positions rather than hiring new employees to fill the open positions 
our general and administrative expenses were lower in compared to due to decreased professional fees associated with projects related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and other similar services from accounting and consulting firms 
general and administrative expenses in also included a gain related to the elimination of our former guarantee of a promissory note for source medical see note  related party transactions  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements

these costs include pharmaceuticals  needles  bandages  food  and other similar items 
while supplies expense did not change significantly in terms of dollars from to  it did decrease as a percent of net operating revenues year over year 
this decrease is due to our supply chain management efforts and our increasing revenue base 
supplies expense did not change significantly from to depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization in each year presented was due to the decreased depreciable base of our assets due to the level of our capital expenditures over the past few years

provision for doubtful accounts our provision for doubtful accounts decreased as a percent of net operating revenues from to distractions associated with the installation of new collections software negatively impacted collection activity during the latter half of this year over year improvement in our provision for doubtful accounts was reflective of the benefits of the new billing and collections software that was installed in  as well as the standardization of certain business office processes 
while we are beginning to see the improvements noted above  throughout  we have experienced the continued denial of certain billings by one of our medicare contractors denying claims related to medical necessity 
we appeal most of these denials and have experienced a strong success rate for claims that have completed the appeals process 
while our success rate is a positive reflection of the medical necessity of the applicable patients  the appeals process can take in excess of one year  and we cannot provide assurance as to the ongoing and future success of our appeals 
as such  we have provided reserves for these receivables in accordance with our accounting policy that necessarily considers the age of the receivables under appeal as part of our provision for doubtful accounts 
during the third quarter of  the negative impact of these denials became level  year over year

for additional information regarding the allocated amounts  see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements

also  as discussed earlier in this item  we recorded a million net gain on lease termination during provision for income tax benefit expense the change in our provision for income tax benefit expense from to was due primarily to the recovery of federal income taxes  and related interest  for tax years through  as discussed in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
from to  our provision for income tax expense increased due to an increase in noncurrent deferred taxes associated with certain indefinite lived assets partially offset by a decrease in state tax expense and by an increase in interest income recorded on our income tax receivable 
during  we filed a request for a tax accounting method change which accelerated the amortization of certain indefinite lived assets 
this tax accounting method change gave rise to an additional difference between the book and tax bases of the assets effected and  accordingly  resulted in our recording an additional deferred tax liability and deferred tax expense of approximately million related to these indefinite lived assets during impact of inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  we believe that through adherence to cost containment policies and labor and supply management  the effects of inflation on future operating results should be manageable 
however  we have little or no ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing services to medicare and medicaid patients due to federal and state laws that establish fixed reimbursement rates 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients to managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited

simultaneously with the execution of this purchase agreement with the university of alabama  we executed an agreement with an affiliate of the university of alabama whereby this entity provided certain management services to the birmingham medical center 
on december   we executed an amended and restated asset purchase agreement with the university of alabama 
this amended and restated agreement provided that the university of alabama purchase the birmingham medical center and associated real and personal property as well as our interest in the gamma knife partnership associated with this hospital 
this transaction closed on march  from to  the decrease in net operating revenues related primarily to the performance and eventual sale or closure of the union  alexandria  winnfield  and terre haute ltchs along with the timing of closures of our cedar court hospital and central georgia rehabilitation hospital 
from to  the decrease in net operating revenues related primarily to the performance and eventual sale of the birmingham medical center 
the change in costs and expenses in each year followed these same trends 
the net loss on disposal of assets in was primarily the result of our sale of the birmingham medical center and lease termination fees associated with certain properties adjacent to the birmingham medical center 
surgery centers 
we closed the transaction to sell our surgery centers division to asc on june   other than with respect to certain facilities for which approvals for the transfer to asc had not yet been received as of such date 
in august and november  we received approval and transferred the applicable facilities in connecticut and rhode island  respectively  but approval for the applicable facilities in illinois remained pending as of december  see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
no portion of the purchase price was withheld at closing pending the transfer of these facilities 
as of december   we have deferred approximately million of cash proceeds received at closing associated with the facilities that were still awaiting approval for transfer to asc as of december  during the third quarter of  we also reached an agreement with certain of our remaining partners to sell an additional facility to asc 
this facility was an opt out partnership at the time the original transaction closed with asc 
after deducting deal and separation costs  we received approximately million of net cash proceeds in conjunction with the sale of this facility 
as a result of the disposition of our surgery centers division  including the opt out partnership discussed above  we recorded gains on disposal of approximately million  including an approximate million income tax benefit primarily related to the reversal upon sale of deferred tax liabilities arising from indefinite lived intangible assets of the division  during the year ended december  we expect to record an additional gain of approximately million to million for the facilities that remained pending in illinois as of december  for additional information  see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
from to  the decrease in net operating revenues related primarily to the divestiture of the division on june   as discussed previously

from to  the decrease in net operating revenues related to the divestiture of the division on may   as discussed previously 
from to  the decrease in net operating revenues related primarily to a year over year decline in patient visits that resulted from competition from physician owned physical therapy sites and the nationwide physical therapist shortage 
in addition  the volume decrease from to was also due to the annual per beneficiary limitations on medicare outpatient therapy services that became effective on january  the change in costs and expenses in each year followed these same trends 
diagnostic 
we closed the transaction to sell our diagnostic division to the gores group on july   other than with respect to one facility for which approval for the transfer had not yet been received as of such date 
the net cash proceeds received at closing  after deducting deal and separation costs and purchase price adjustments  approximated million 
as a result of the disposition of our diagnostic division  we recorded an approximate million post tax loss on disposal during the year ended december  this loss primarily resulted from working capital adjustments based on the final balance sheet 
for additional information  see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the net operating revenues and costs and expenses for the year ended december  were lower than those in due to the closing of the transaction to sell our diagnostic division to the gores group on july   as discussed above  lower scan volumes due to new restrictions imposed by certain payors  and the negative impact on pricing of the deficit reduction act for diagnostic imaging services effective january  the net operating revenues for were lower than those of due to lower scan volumes that resulted primarily from new restrictions imposed by certain payors and competition from physician owned diagnostic equipment and a shift in case mix to lower paying modalities 
costs and expenses in each period generally followed these same trends 
however  included costs associated with the implementation of a new enterprise information technology system and costs associated with the outsourcing of collection activities 
during the year ended december   we wrote the intangible assets and certain long lived assets of our diagnostic division down to their estimated fair value based on the estimated net proceeds we expected to receive from the divestiture of the division 
this charge is included in impairments in the above results of operations of our diagnostic division 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations  and revolving loans under our credit agreement as defined in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we are highly leveraged 
however  our leverage and liquidity are improving 
during the year ended december   we used the net proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions to pay down debt 
we also used approximately million of our million income tax recovery from the irs see note  long term debt  and note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to pay down amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
also  we used drawings under our revolving credit facility and available cash to redeem approximately million of our senior notes due as a result of these transactions  our total debt outstanding has decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  approximately million of our billion of long term debt outstanding as of december  represents amounts drawn under our million revolving credit facility excluding approximately million utilized under the revolving letter of credit subfacility 
amounts were drawn from the revolving credit facility primarily due to the timing of interest payments and government settlement payments as discussed in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
based on our current borrowing capacity and leverage ratio required under our credit agreement  we do not believe there is significant risk in our ability to make additional draws under our revolving credit facility  if needed 
we have scheduled principal payments of million and million in and  respectively  related to long term debt obligations see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we made the final payments related to our medicare program settlement and our sec settlement see note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
with these settlement payments behind us  we are now able to redirect our operating cash elsewhere in the company 
in addition  we expect to use cash flows from the expected sale of our corporate campus see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the receipt of additional income tax refunds see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to further reduce our long term debt outstanding 
however  no assurances can be given as to whether or when such cash flows will be received 
as with any company carrying significant debt  our primary risk relating to our high leverage is the possibility that a down turn in operating earnings could impair our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit agreement 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms as favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
a default due to violation of the covenants contained within our credit agreement could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement 
see item a  risk factors  of this form k and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us 
changes in our business or other factors may occur that might have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of funding are cash flows from operations and borrowings under long term debt agreements 
over the past three years  our funds were used primarily to fund working capital requirements  make capital expenditures  and make payments under various settlement agreements 
the following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing  and financing activities for the years ended december    and  as well as the effect of exchange rates for those same years in millions as of december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared to operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from to this increase resulted from higher net operating revenues and lower operating expenses year over year 
specifically  we experienced a million reduction in professional fees accounting  tax  and legal from to in addition  we received a million federal income tax recovery in october see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities in and also included payments of approximately million and million  respectively  related to government  class action  and related settlements 
investing activities 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities from to was due to the cash proceeds received from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities was due to the use of the net cash proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions see note  assets held for sale and results of discontinued operations  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the majority of our federal income tax recovery see note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  to reduce debt outstanding under our credit agreement during during  we made approximately billion of net debt payments  while during  we made approximately million of net debt payments 
financing activities for also included approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible perpetual preferred stock see note  convertible perpetual preferred stock  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
compared to operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased from to due to volume declines year over year  as discussed above 
net cash used in operating activities in and included payments of approximately million and million  respectively  related to government  class action  and related settlements 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities increased from to due primarily to a reduction in restricted cash and proceeds from asset disposals for facilities in discontinued operations 
in prior years  the cash of certain partnerships in which we participate was restricted because one or more external partners requested  and we agreed  not to commingle the partnership s cash with other corporate cash accounts 
during  we were able to eliminate many of these restrictions through discussions and negotiations with our external partners 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities from compared to was due to the recapitalization transactions and private offering of senior notes in see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these transactions  net payments on debt  increased by approximately million for we also paid approximately million more in debt issuance costs during over due to these transactions 
these increased payments were offset by approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible perpetual preferred stock see note  convertible perpetual preferred stock  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in we also paid approximately million in dividends on our convertible perpetual preferred stock during adjusted consolidated ebitda management continues to believe adjusted consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement is a measure of leverage capacity  our ability to service our debt  and our ability to make capital expenditures 
however  as we continue to deleverage our balance sheet and the large  non ordinary course charges related to the sins of the past are behind us  this measure will become less significant 
we use adjusted consolidated ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these covenants are material terms of the credit agreement  and the credit agreement represents a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our credit agreement our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms as favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants  we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness  making certain payments  and acquiring and disposing of assets 
consequently  adjusted consolidated ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
in general terms  the definition of adjusted consolidated ebitda  per our credit agreement  allows us to add back to adjusted consolidated ebitda all unusual non cash items or non recurring items 
these items include  but may not be limited to  amounts associated with government  class action  and related settlements  fees  costs  and expenses related to our recapitalization transactions  any losses from discontinued operations and closed locations  charges in respect of professional fees for reconstruction and restatement of financial statements  including fees paid to outside professional firms for matters related to internal controls and legal fees for continued litigation defense and support matters discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  compensation expenses recorded in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  investment and other income including interest income  and fees associated with our divestiture activities 
we reconcile adjusted consolidated ebitda to net income loss 
however  adjusted consolidated ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  and the items excluded from adjusted consolidated ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
therefore  adjusted consolidated ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities 
because adjusted consolidated ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted consolidated ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements

sarbanes oxley related costs adjusted consolidated ebitda after consummation of the divestitures discussed earlier in this item  and in accordance with our credit agreement including the march amendment to the credit agreement discussed in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  adjusted consolidated ebitda is calculated to give effect to each divestiture  including adjustments for the allocation of corporate overhead to each divested division 
therefore  for purposes of covenant calculations reported to our lenders under the credit agreement  we add back a corporate overhead allocation for each divested division in the quarter in which the applicable transaction closes 
however  while these allocations are additive to adjusted consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement  these allocations are estimates and are not necessarily indicative of the adjusted consolidated ebitda that would have resulted had the applicable divisions been divested as of the beginning of each period presented 
accordingly  they have not been added back to net income loss in the table above and are not included in the above calculation of adjusted consolidated ebitda 
in addition  we are allowed to add other income  including interest income  to the calculation of adjusted consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement 
this includes the interest income associated with our federal income tax recovery  as discussed in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this amount has not been included in the above calculation  as it would not be indicative of our adjusted consolidated ebitda for future periods

adjusted consolidated ebtida for the year ended december  included the bad debt recovery from meadowbrook and the net gain on lease termination associated with our former braintree and woburn hospitals  as discussed above 
adjusted consolidated ebitda decreased from to due primarily to the recovery from mr 
scrushy recorded in the decrease in adjusted consolidated ebitda from to was also due to higher salaries and benefits and other operating expenses  as discussed above 
adjusted consolidated ebitda decreased from to due to the decline in inpatient discharges we experienced year over year and the increase to our provision for doubtful accounts  as discussed above 
current liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excludes approximately million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities  which are assets whose use is restricted because of various obligations we have under lending agreements  partnership agreements  and other arrangements  primarily related to our captive insurance company 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash  and million of restricted marketable securities 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  marketable securities to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as noted above and throughout this report  we used the net proceeds from our divestiture transactions and the majority of our federal income tax recovery to reduce our long term debt during as of december  and  our long term debt consists of the following excluding notes payable to banks and others and capital lease obligations in millions december  revolving credit facility term loan facility bonds payable the anticipated cash flows from the expected sale of our corporate campus and additional income tax recoveries will be used primarily to further reduce debt 
however  no assurances can be given as to whether or when such cash flows will be received 
in march  we amended our existing credit agreement as defined in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to lower the applicable interest rates and modify certain other covenants 
the amendment and related supplement reduced the interest rate on our term loan facility to libor plus formerly libor plus  as well as reduced the applicable participation rate on the million synthetic letter of credit facility to formerly 
the amendment also gave us the appropriate approvals for our divestiture activities 
funding commitments we have scheduled principal payments of million and million in and  respectively  related to long term debt obligations 
for additional information about our long term debt obligations  see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of approximately million 
the total amounts expected for capital expenditures and development efforts for approximate million to million 
actual amounts spent will be dependent upon the timing of development projects and receipt of the cash flows from the expected sale of our corporate campus and additional income tax refunds 
these expenditures include it initiatives  new business opportunities  and equipment upgrades and purchases 
approximately million of this budgeted amount is non discretionary 
for a discussion of risk factors related to our business and our industry  please see item a  risk factors  of this report and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for the company 
we are secondarily liable for certain lease obligations associated with sold facilities  including the sale of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions during also  in connection with the closing of the transaction to sell our diagnostic division  healthsouth remained as a guarantor of certain leases for properties and equipment and a guarantor to certain purchase and servicing contracts that were assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale 
as of december   we were secondarily liable for such guarantees 
the remaining terms of these guarantees range from month to months 
if we were required to perform under all such guarantees  the maximum amount we would be required to pay approximates million 
we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees  as we do not believe it is probable we will have to perform under these agreements 
if we are required to perform under these guarantees  we could potentially have recourse against the purchaser for recovery of any amounts paid 
in addition  the purchasers of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions have agreed to seek releases from the lessors and vendors in favor of healthsouth with respect to the guarantee obligations associated with these divestitures 
to the extent the purchasers of these divisions are unable to obtain releases for healthsouth  the purchasers have agreed to indemnify healthsouth for damages incurred under the guarantee obligations  if any 
for additional information regarding these guarantees  see note  guarantees  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  as discussed in note  settlements  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  our securities litigation settlement agreement requires us to indemnify the settling insurance carriers  to the extent permitted by law  for any amounts they are legally obligated to pay to any non settling defendants 
as of december   we have not recorded a liability regarding these indemnifications  as we do not believe it is probable we will have to perform under the indemnification portion of these settlement agreements  and any amount we would be required to pay is not estimable at this time 
as of december   we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
as of december   we hold one derivative financial instrument  as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap related to our credit agreement  as discussed in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in millions total and thereafter long term debt obligations long term debt excluding revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations a revolving credit facility interest on long term debt b capital lease obligations c operating lease obligations d e purchase obligations e f other long term liabilities g total a included in long term debt are amounts owed on our bonds payable and notes payable to banks and others 
these borrowings are further explained in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b interest on our fixed rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate 
interest expense on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of december  interest related to capital lease obligations is excluded from this line 
amounts exclude amortization of debt discounts  amortization of loan fees  or fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
amounts also exclude the impact of our interest rate swap 
c amounts include interest portion of future minimum capital lease payments 
d we lease many of our hospitals as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our hospital leases require percentage rentals on patient revenues above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
e future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
f purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on healthsouth and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support  medical supplies  certain equipment  and telecommunications 
g because their future cash outflows are uncertain  the following noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above medical malpractice and workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes  and our estimated liability for unsettled litigation 
for more information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  self insured risks  note  income taxes  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  as discussed in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  at december   we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  we had an accrual for related interest income of million as of december  we continue to actively pursue the maximization of our remaining income tax refund claims 
the process of resolving these tax matters with the applicable taxing authorities will continue throughout  and will likely extend into at this time  we cannot estimate a range of the reasonably possible change that may occur 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  healthsouth enters into contractual arrangements under which healthsouth may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of healthsouth or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
in december  mr 
scrushy filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association purportedly pursuant to an indemnity agreement with us 
the arbitration demand sought to require us to pay expenses incurred by mr 
scrushy  including attorneys fees  in connection with the defense of criminal fraud claims against him and in connection with a preliminary hearing in the sec litigation 
in october  the arbitrator issued a final award confirming an interim award of approximately million to mr 
scrushy and further ruling that mr 
scrushy is entitled to have healthsouth pay him a total of approximately million in pre judgment interest and attorneys fees and expenses incurred by mr 
scrushy in connection with the arbitration proceeding 
based on an agreement with mr 
scrushy  we offset the approximate million including post judgment interest award to him in the arbitration against the approximate million judgment against mr 
scrushy in the tucker actions for repayment of bonuses 
we accrued an estimate of these legal fees as of december  and  which was included in professional fees accounting  tax  and legal in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in connection with the arbitration demand 
based on the arbitrator s ruling  we may have an obligation to indemnify mr 
scrushy for certain costs associated with ongoing litigation 
as of december  and  an estimate of these legal fees is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  in connection with the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  we have certain post closing indemnification obligations to the respective purchasers 
these indemnification obligations arose from liabilities not assumed by the purchasers  such as certain types of litigation  any breach by us of the purchase agreements  liabilities associated with assets that were excluded from the divestitures  and other types of liabilities that are customary in transactions of these types 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgment that affects the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates  and judgments to ensure our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize net patient service revenues in the reporting period in which we perform the service based on our current billing rates ie  gross charges  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans 
we record gross service charges in our accounting records on an accrual basis using our established rates for the type of service provided to the patient 
we recognize an estimated contractual allowance to reduce gross patient charges to the amount we estimate we will actually realize for the service rendered based upon previously agreed to rates with a payor 
our patient accounting system calculates contractual allowances on a patient by patient basis based on the rates in effect for each primary third party payor 
other factors that are considered and could further influence the level of our reserves include the patient s total length of stay for in house patients  the proportion of patients with secondary insurance coverage and the level of reimbursement under that secondary coverage  and the amount of charges that will be disallowed by payors 
such additional factors are assumed to remain consistent with the experience for patients discharged in similar time periods for the same payor classes  and additional reserves are provided to account for these factors  accordingly 
payors include federal and state agencies  including medicare and medicaid  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies  employers  and patients 
management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms that result from contract renegotiations and renewals 
in addition  laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
due to complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  which are often subject to interpretation  we may receive reimbursement for health care services authorized and provided that is different from our estimates  and such differences could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare  managed care payors  other third party payors  and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
the primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement  but patient responsibility amounts deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  our historical collection experience for each type of payor  and other relevant factors so that the remaining receivables  net of allowances  are reflected at their estimated net realizable values 
accounts requiring collection efforts are reviewed each days via system generated work queues that automatically stage accounts requiring collection efforts for patient account representatives 
collection efforts include contacting the applicable party both in writing and by telephone  providing information both financial and clinical to allow for payment or to overturn payor decisions to deny payment  and arranging payment plans with self pay patients  among other techniques 
when we determine that all in house efforts have been exhausted or that it is a more prudent use of resources  accounts may be turned over to a collection agency 
accounts are written off after all collection efforts internal and external have been exhausted 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
adverse changes in general economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix  or trends in federal or state governmental and private employer health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the table below shows a summary aging of our net accounts receivable balance as of december  and information on the concentration of total patient accounts receivable by payor class can be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies  accounts receivable  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december  in millions days days days days days patient accounts receivable non patient accounts receivable accounts receivable  net self insured risks we are self insured for certain losses related to professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation risks 
although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims  a substantial portion of our professional liability and workers compensation risks are insured through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
obligations covered by reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent reinsurers do not meet their obligations 
our reserves and provisions for professional liability and workers compensation risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates calculated by third party actuaries 
the actuaries consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  exposure data  loss development  and geography 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
changes to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results 
all reserves are undiscounted 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately  individual claims as of december  and estimates for potential unreported claims 
the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated 
the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed management s estimates 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that represents the risk inherent in future cash flows 
using the impairment review methodology described herein  we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of approximately million during the year ended december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we follow the guidance in fasb statement no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  at the reporting unit level 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of october st of each year 
our other intangible assets consist of acquired certificates of need  licenses  and noncompete agreements 
we amortize these assets over periods ranging from to years 
as of december   we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we continue to review the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances change in a manner that indicates their carrying values may not be recoverable 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of october   using the methodology described herein  and determined no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december  approximated million 
share based payments fasb statement no 
r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
for the majority of our share based awards  the fair value is estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans 
we use a lattice model for restricted stock that vests upon the achievement of a market condition and a service condition 
however  these amounts are not material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends  impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation expense recorded in each year 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we estimate our expected term through an analysis of actual  historical post vesting exercise  cancellation  and expiration behavior by our employees and projected post vesting activity of outstanding options 
we currently calculate volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options  excluding a distinct period of extreme volatility between and the risk free interest rate is the implied daily yield currently available on us treasury issues with a remaining term closely approximating the expected term used as the input to the black scholes option pricing model 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we do not include a dividend payment as part of our pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures through an analysis of actual  historical pre vesting option forfeiture activity 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to expense adjustments that could be material to our results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
on january  the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances at december  aggregating billion against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and other factors 
as discussed in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  during  we settled all federal income tax issues outstanding with the irs for the tax years through  and we received an approximate million income tax refund  including associated interest 
we continue to actively pursue the maximization of our remaining income tax refund claims through the preparation and filing of amended federal and state income tax returns 
the actual amount of the refunds will not be finally determined until all of the applicable taxing authorities have completed their review 
although management believes its estimates and judgments related to these claims are reasonable  depending on the ultimate resolution of these tax matters  actual amounts recovered could differ from management s estimates  and such differences could be material 
assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies that could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded it is probable a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingent matter 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of fasb statement no 
relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fasb statement no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the provisions of fasb statement no 
should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption  with exceptions for certain financial instruments listed in the statement 
we will adopt the provisions of fasb statement no 
on january  the adoption of the statement will result only in additional disclosures in our interim and annual reports beginning with the first quarter of no impact is expected on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued two staff positions that amended fasb statement no 
fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement  amended fasb statement no 
to exclude fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions 
fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 delayed the effective date of fasb statement no 
by one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the issuance of these two staff positions did not change our above conclusions regarding the impact of fasb statement no 
on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of the new standard is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the new standard establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
it also requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements more easily understand the effect of a company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
the statement also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
fasb statement no 
does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statements no 
and fasb statement no 
fasb statement no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we did not elect the fair value option of fasb statement no 
on january  therefore  the statement will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations 
fasb statement no 
r contains significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions  and it continues the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures 
it changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
further  certain of the changes will introduce more volatility into earnings and thus may impact a company s acquisition strategy 
in addition  fasb statement no 
r will impact the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions that close both before and after the effective date of the new standard 
fasb statement no 
r will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity s first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   or january  for healthsouth 
we have not begun evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of fasb statement no 
r could have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fasb statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for minority interests recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
fasb statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   or january  for healthsouth 
the statement is to be applied prospectively  however the presentation and disclosure requirements of the statement will need to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
at this time  we have not completed our evaluation of the impact the adoption of fasb statement no 
will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
however  at a minimum  it will change the way in which we account for and report our minority interests 
we do not believe any other recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
for additional information regarding recent account pronouncements  see note  summary of significant policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on these items 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates impacts the net market value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows 
interest rate changes on variable rate debt impacts our interest expense and cash flows  but does not impact the net fair value of the underlying debt instruments 
our fixed and variable rate debt as of december  is shown in the following table as of december  carrying amount of total estimated fair value of total in millions fixed rate debt variable rate debt total long term debt as discussed in more detail in note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the floating rate of a portion of our credit agreement to a fixed rate in order to limit our exposure to variability in interest payments caused by changes in libor 
under the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of on billion of variable rate debt  while the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreement pay a floating rate based on month libor 
as of december   the fair market value of our interest rate swap approximated million 
per the underlying swap agreement  the notional amount of our interest rate swap was scheduled to be reduced from billion to billion in march however  during  we used the net proceeds from the divestitures of our surgery centers  outpatient  and diagnostic divisions  as well as the majority of the federal income tax refunds received from the internal revenue service see note  long term debt  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements to reduce debt outstanding under our credit agreement 
due to these pre payments  as well as current market conditions  we decreased the notional amount of our interest rate swap to billion in october fees associated with this transaction were not material to our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
based on the variable rate of our debt as of december  and inclusive of the impact of the conversion of billion of variable rate interest to a fixed rate via an interest rate swap  as discussed above  a increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest expense per year  while a decrease in interest rates would reduce interest expense by million per year 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the estimated net fair value of our fixed rate debt  and a decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate million increase in its estimated net fair value 
if libor continues to decrease as it has early in  our interest payments will decrease 
however  the vast majority of these reduced interest payments will be offset by net settlement payments on our interest rate swap  which are included in the line item loss on interest rate swap in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies  are currently  and have been  insignificant to our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows
