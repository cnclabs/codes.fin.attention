performance highlights years ended december  operating highlights change in thousands revenues income from operations years ended december  cash flow highlights change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities our revenue growth for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  can be attributed to an increasing number and activity level of users across our offerings on yahoo properties and through our distribution 
table of contents network of affiliates 
marketing services and fees revenues experienced percent and percent year over year growth  respectively 
our revenues for the year ended december  increased percent year over year to approximately billion  with fee paying users up percent year over year  and page views up percent year over year 
operating income for the year ended december  declined by million 
the decline reflects year over year increases in operating expenses of million offset by the impact of additional margin related to year over year revenue growth 
cash generated from our operations is a measure of the cash productivity of our business model and is an area of focus for us 
our operating activities in generated adequate cash to meet our operating needs 
cash used in investing activities in included capital expenditures of million  as well as cash consideration for acquisitions of million  offset by the sale of marketable debt securities 
cash used in financing activities in reflected our net cash used for direct and structured stock repurchases of billion  offset by cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million as a result of the exercise of employee stock options 
during  we determined that income tax benefits of million million related to and the remainder related to earlier years should not have been recorded to additional paid in capital as tax benefits from stock based awards because for financial statement ordering purposes  the tax benefits should have been attributed to the utilization of acquired net operating losses first or should not have been recognized at all because the underlying tax amounts should not have been offset by tax benefits from stock based awards 
as a result  in the statement of cash flows  we reduced by million  excess tax benefits from stock based awards recorded in cash flows from operating activities with an equivalent reduction to the amount of excess tax benefits recorded in cash flows from financing activities 
this reclassification had no impact on overall cash flows 
the amounts that impacted income tax expense and earnings in equity interests also increased diluted earnings per share by for the year ended december  we believe that the aforementioned amounts are not material to reported amounts for   or earlier years and therefore we have corrected them in the consolidated financial statements 
see note income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
summary we believe the search queries  page views  click throughs  and the related marketing services and fees revenues that we generate correlate to the number and activity level of users across our offerings on yahoo properties and the activity level on our affiliate sites 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched a new search marketing system  referred to as project panama  and we have completed our migration plan for our active advertisers worldwide onto the new system 
we believe the new search marketing system  including the new ranking model which was launched in all of our major domestic and international markets in  in addition to ongoing enhancements in which we are investing  enables us to provide a more relevant search experience to users  more valuable customer leads to advertisers  and additional opportunities to our affiliate and distribution partners 
by providing a platform for our users that brings together our search technology  content  and community while allowing for personalization and integration across devices  we seek to become more essential to  increase our share of  and deepen the engagement of  our users with our products and services 
we believe this deeper engagement of new and existing users and our new search marketing system  coupled with the growth of the internet as an advertising medium will enable us to increase our revenues in in the following management s discussion and analysis  we discuss the following areas of our financial results results of operations  business segment results  transactions  liquidity and capital resources  critical accounting policies and estimates  and recent accounting pronouncements

searches is defined as online search queries that may yield internet search results ranked and sorted based on relevance to the user s search query 
sponsored search results are a subset of the overall search results  and provide links to paying advertisers web pages 
we currently generate marketing services revenues principally from display advertising on owned and operated sites and from sponsored search results generated from searches on owned and operated and affiliate sites 
in addition  we receive revenues for content match links advertising on yahoo properties and affiliate sites which include contextually relevant advertiser links to their respective websites on owned and operated and affiliate sites and display advertising on affiliate sites 
the net revenues and related volume metrics from these additional sources are not currently material and are excluded from the discussion and calculation of average revenue per page view on owned and operated sites and average revenue per search on affiliate sites that follows 

table of contents marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites 
marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or percent  as compared to factors leading to growth in overall marketing services revenues included an increase in user activity levels on yahoo properties  which contributed to a higher volume of search queries  click throughs  page views  and ad impression displays 
also our growing audience of users makes yahoo properties more attractive to advertisers and increases their spending on marketing services 
we expect marketing services revenues from our owned and operated sites to continue growing at a rate faster than total revenues 
marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or percent  as compared to our marketing services revenues in was impacted by declining revenues from our relationship with microsoft corporation microsoft  which completed the transition of its us business search business in house during the year over year growth in marketing services revenues in  despite the impact of microsoft s transition  can be attributed to a combination of factors that have driven increased marketing services revenues across yahoo properties both domestically and internationally 
these included an increase in our user base and activity levels on yahoo properties  which resulted in a higher volume of search queries  ad impression displays  and click throughs 
we periodically review and refine our methodology for monitoring  gathering  and counting page views to more accurately reflect the total number of web pages viewed by users on yahoo properties 
based on this process  from time to time we update our methodology to exclude from the count of page views interactions with our servers that we determine or believe are not the result of user visits to our owned and operated sites 
using our updated methodology  for the year ended december  as compared to  page views increased percent and revenue per page view increased percent  and for the year ended december  as compared to  page views increased percent and revenue per page view increased percent 
in the table below  we set forth the quarterly and year over year growth in page views and revenue per page view for the year ended december  and the year over year growth in page views and revenue per page view for the year ended december   both as previously reported and as revised to reflect our updated methodology

beginning in the second quarter of  we revised our presentation of page views and revenue per page view to include only page views on owned and operated sites and revenues from such page views  and to exclude searches on affiliate sites and revenues from such searches 
if the previously reported page view growth and revenue per page view growth for the three month period ended march  and year ended december  were adjusted to reflect the presentation adopted in the second quarter of but not our updated methodology for counting page views  the reported percentages would have been percent  and negative percent  for the three month period ended march  and percent  and percent  for the year ended december  the revised page view growth and revenue per page view growth numbers reflect our updated methodology for counting page views  and for the year ended december  and the three month period ended march   also include adjustments to conform to the presentation adopted in the second quarter of 
table of contents we believe our growing number of users  advertisers  publishers  and inventory  both on and off our network  over recent years has been driving the increases in our marketing services revenues 
we also believe our expanding offerings  including our enhanced algorithmic search technology  contribute to our growing number of users 
as our user base increases  we process a higher number of search queries and generate a higher number of page views 
we also believe that our growing audience of users make yahoo properties more attractive to advertisers and increases their spending on marketing services 
further  we believe the growth in users on yahoo properties and on the internet overall reflects the increasing acceptance  importance  and dependence of users on the internet 
as a result of this growth in the online audience  we believe advertisers are shifting a greater percentage of their spending from traditional media to the internet to reach this growing audience 
we currently expect marketing services revenues on our owned and operated sites to increase in absolute dollars for compared to as we seek to increase marketing services revenues on yahoo properties by providing a more relevant search experience to users  providing more relevant and valuable customer leads to advertisers from our new search marketing system  and improving our technologies to expand and improve our offerings 
marketing services revenues from affiliate sites 
marketing services revenues from affiliate sites for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  as compared to marketing services revenues from affiliate sites for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  as compared to as more inventory becomes available on the web it has  and will continue to make  the affiliate business more competitive  consequently  our portion of revenue share from affiliate sites is declining 
we expect this trend to continue in however  we also expect to experience some favorable impact from our off network display initiatives 
while this display business is still relatively small  we expect continued growth as our major partnerships gain momentum 
the number of searches on affiliate sites increased by approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared to the number of searches on affiliate sites increased by approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared to the increase in the volume of searches is primarily attributed to the net increase in the number of affiliates 
the average revenue per search on our affiliate sites decreased by percent for the year ended december   as compared to the average revenue per search on our affiliate sites decreased by percent for the year ended december   as compared to the decline in average revenues per search is primarily as a result of a decline in revenues from certain affiliate sites 
additionally  during the third quarter of we sold overture japan to yahoo japan 
as part of this transaction we also entered into a commercial arrangement with yahoo japan in which we provide advertising and search marketing services to yahoo japan for a service fee 
this arrangement began on september  and  beginning on that date  we commenced recording marketing services revenues from yahoo japan for the provision of search marketing services based on a percentage of advertising revenues earned by yahoo japan for the delivery of sponsored search results 
the sale of overture japan to yahoo japan negatively impacted our net revenues from affiliate sites by percent for fees revenues 
for the year ended december   fees revenues increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to the year over year growth is associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which numbered million as of december   compared to million as of december   an increase of percent 
the impact of this increase in our number of paying users was offset by a reduction in the average monthly revenues per paying user as discussed below

the impact of this increase in our number of paying users was offset by a reduction in the average monthly revenues per paying user discussed below 
our increased base of paying users grew across most of our offerings 
our fee based services include internet broadband services  sports  music  games  personals  and premium mail offerings  as well as our services for small 
table of contents businesses 
average monthly revenues per paying user decreased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to approximately and for the same periods in and  respectively 
the decline in average monthly revenues per paying user reflects decreases in fees made in the year 
recently  we have been working with our broadband internet access partners partners to renew and extend our relationships 
as we renew these access relationships  we are seeking to add new opportunities to improve on our historic strengths in portal  search  and mail 
the market has moved to an environment in which advertising revenue sharing is the prevailing model  and we are evolving our partnerships accordingly and our partners are re signing with us due to the strategic importance of our relationships and the products we offer 
this will result in a reduction in fees revenues associated with these deals  but should be offset by increased marketing services revenues associated with the display advertising and sponsored search revenue share arrangements

approximately percent of the increase  or million  came from marketing services revenues and approximately percent of the increase  or million  came from marketing services revenues 
the advertising growth can be attributed to our expanding user base which has been attracting more advertisers and has been contributing to our growth in our advertising revenues 
the growth in our fee based services is due to the increase in our paying users for both existing and new offerings 
united states operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  as compared to united states operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  as compared to international 
international revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to international revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to more than percent of the international revenues increase in and came from marketing services revenues 
the year over year growth in international marketing services revenues can be attributed to our increased penetration into existing markets  coupled with continued growth of the global online advertising marketplace 
international operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  as compared to international operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  as compared to international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during both and and percent during the strong performance of our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won  taiwan dollars  australian dollars  and canadian dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses  and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international segment if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates in the year ended december   our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense would have been lower than we reported by million

as a result  in the statement of cash flows  we reduced by million  excess tax benefits from stock based awards recorded in cash flows from operating activities with an equivalent reduction to the amount of excess tax benefits recorded in cash flows from financing activities 
this reclassification had no impact on overall cash flows 
the amounts that impacted income tax expense and earnings in equity interests also increased diluted earnings per share by for the year ended december  we believe that the aforementioned amounts are not material to reported amounts for   or earlier years and therefore we have

our operating activities for each year in the three years ended december  have generated adequate cash to meet our operating needs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities totaling  million  compared to  million as of december  during the year ended december   we invested  million in direct stock repurchases of which million related to restricted stock awards net share settlement and million in structured stock repurchases 
additionally  we invested net million  in capital expenditures and a net million in acquisitions 
the cash used for these investments was offset by  million of cash generated from operating activities  and million from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options 
in  million of excess tax benefits from stock based awards were included as a source of cash flows from financing activities 
in  excess tax benefits from stock based awards of million were included as a source of cash flows from financing activities 
as of december   approximately billion of earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries and a corporate joint venture are designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
if these funds were required for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes to repatriate these funds 
currently  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to our united states operations 
we invest excess cash predominantly in marketable debt securities that are liquid  of high quality investment grade  and the majority of which have effective maturities of less than two years 
our marketable debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are reported in other income  net 
the fair value for securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date 
we also invest excess cash to support our growing infrastructure needs and expand our operations  as consideration for acquisitions and strategic investments  to repurchase shares of our stock  and in other transactions 
as of december   certain of our marketable debt securities had a fair value below cost representing less than million due to the changes in market rates of interest and yields on these securities 
we evaluate these investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for an anticipated recovery in market value 
we have the intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment and expect to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity because we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to support our business operations and capital expenditures 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity  or debt securities  or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
in april  we issued million of zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes which mature on april  these notes are convertible into yahoo common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
each  principal amount of the notes is convertible on or prior to april  if the market price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time or specified corporate transactions occur 
as of january   the specified price threshold had been met and the notes are convertible at any time through march  the notes may be convertible on april  depending on whether the specified price threshold is met for the applicable periods or a specified corporate transaction occurs prior to april  we will be required to pay the outstanding principal amount of any notes not converted by the holders on or before april  in cash 
consequently  the notes have been classified as short term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  although we have sufficient available funds to pay the notes  in the event the notes are not converted on or before their maturity date  we may seek financing to fund the repayment of the notes  as well as to fund other strategic initiatives 

table of contents cash flow changes cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items  and non operating gains and losses from sales of investments 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  tax benefits from stock based awards  deferred income taxes  and earnings in equity interests 
cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income in mainly due to the net impact of non cash adjustments to income 
in each of the three years ended december    and  cash flows from operations were reduced by the increase in our accounts receivable balance  mainly reflecting increases in revenues 
the days of sales outstanding metric increased over the three years ended december  additionally  in the years ended december    and  there were significant increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities that positively impacted cash flow from operations 
these increases were mainly due to higher accrual balances for taxes payable and tac payments to affiliates  respectively 
cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  purchases and sales of marketable debt and equity securities  purchases of intangible assets  as well as acquisitions including our strategic investments 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures have been primarily used for purchases and internal development of information technology assets  and real estate to support our expanding offerings  and our increased number of users

our cash proceeds from the net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities were billion in  compared to cash proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  we generated cash in the amount of billion in from the sale of non strategic marketable equity securities for which there was no comparable activity in and cash used in financing activities is driven by our financing activities relating to employee option exercises and stock repurchases 
our cash proceeds from employee option exercises were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in compared to is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employee exercises in over the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of a reduced number of employees exercising options year over year

stock repurchases in october  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for us to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time over the next five years  depending on market conditions  share price  and other factors 
we believe that additional repurchases made under appropriate market conditions are a prudent use of cash currently available to us in order to enhance long term stockholder value 
repurchases may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  including derivative transactions  and may be made under a rule b plan 
under this program  during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
total cash consideration for the repurchased stock was billion 
during  a million structured stock repurchase transaction which was entered into in the first quarter of also matured and settled 
on the maturity date  we received million shares of our common stock at an effective buy back price of per share from this transaction 
in addition  upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards during the year ended december   we reacquired  shares of such vested stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations 
these repurchased shares were recorded as million of treasury stock and reduced the number of common shares outstanding by  accordingly 
see note stockholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for additional information

affiliate commitments 
in connection with our contracts to provide advertising services to affiliates  we are obligated to make payments  which represent traffic acquisition costs  to our affiliates 
as of december   these commitments totaled million  of which million will be payable in  million will be payable in  and million will be payable in intellectual property rights 
in connection with the licensing of certain intellectual property  we are obligated to invest up to million through july to the extent the licensed intellectual property will benefit future periods  we will capitalize such payments and amortize them over the useful life of the related intellectual property 
other commitments 
in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  business partners  and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of agreements  services to be provided by us  or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors  and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers and former directors and officers of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in  we reversed an earn out accrual related to a prior acquisition  which resulted in a million reduction to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income for which there was no comparable activity in as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated from marketing services and fees 
marketing services revenues are generated from several offerings including the display of textual  rich media advertisements  display of text based links to advertisers websites  listing based services  and commerce based transactions 
fees revenues includes revenue from a variety of consumer and business fee based services 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we may enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the purchase arrangements with our customer for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the arrangement should be characterized as revenue or a reimbursement of costs incurred 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income 
table of contents taxes 
the valuation allowance decreased by million during the year ended december  the decrease is mainly due to adjustments to non us net operating loss carryforwards 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin see note income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  and determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger impairment 
see note goodwill in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
based on our impairment test  there would have to be a significant unfavorable change to our assumptions used in such calculations for an impairment to exist 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
we record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
when there is existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of our other intangible assets which could trigger impairment 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in entities in which we can exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of these entities net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review all of our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of the fair value of the investment involves considering factors such as the following the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and undiscounted cash flows  quoted stock prices of comparable public companies  and other company specific information including recent financing rounds 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based awards  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting option forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future 
table of contents behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  with a term of one year or greater 
we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 
therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a market based implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  as well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised  and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period

recent accounting pronouncements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for  we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas became effective for us on january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r and sfas no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb sfas  which will change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r and sfas will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r and sfas on our consolidated financial position  cash flows  and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in short term marketable debt securities of approximately million and  million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and 
table of contents percent  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments in long term marketable debt securities of approximately million and million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease approximately percent  respectively  in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and the fair market value of the zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes issued by yahoo and due in april is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes will also increase as the market price of yahoo stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our consolidated financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
as of december  and  the fair value of the notes was approximately million and billion  respectively  based on quoted market prices 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues in both and international revenues in increased million  or percent  as compared to the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won  taiwan dollars  australian dollars  and canadian dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses  and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international segment if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense would have been lower than we reported by million 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into united states dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into united states dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is part of stockholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss
