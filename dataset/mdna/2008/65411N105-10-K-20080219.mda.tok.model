nighthawk radiology services  llc  an idaho limited liability company  is our wholly owned subsidiary and was formed in coeur d alene  idaho in to serve as the entity through which we conduct our primary operations 
in march  nighthawk radiology holdings  inc was formed to facilitate a recapitalization of nighthawk radiology services  llc 
on february   a registration statement relating to our initial public offering of our common stock was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
under this registration statement  we registered the issuance of  shares of our common stock  and another  shares of our common stock sold by certain selling stockholders 
all  shares of common stock issued pursuant to the registration statement  including the  shares sold by the selling stockholders  were sold at a price to the public of per share 
recent acquisitions on july   we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of midwest physicians services  llc mps and emergency radiology services ers from spr holdings ii  llc 
mps was formed by st 
paul radiology  pa st 
paul radiology to provide a complete suite of business process services to support its radiology practice 
this suite of business process services includes revenue cycle management  administrative  information technology and other services critical to the operation of a radiology group 
with this acquisition  we now provide a more complete suite of radiology solutions  including professional services  our proprietary workflow technology  and business process solutions 
we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of mps and ers for an aggregate consideration of i million in cash including certain costs associated with the acquisition and ii a warrant that was issued to st 
paul radiology 
this warrant entitles st 
paul radiology to purchase  shares of our common stock at any time after july  and before july  at a price equal to the market price of a share of our common stock at closing on july   which was at close 
the fair value of the warrant of million was calculated using a black scholes model 
million of the cash portion of the purchase price was paid to spr holdings at closing and the remaining million was placed into an escrow account to serve as a source of funds to satisfy the indemnification obligations of spr holdings under the purchase agreement 
on april   we completed the acquisition of the radlinx group  ltd 
radlinx  a privately held radiology services company 
the acquisition expands our core off hours business and helps grow our final 
table of contents interpretation and sub specialty business  while increasing our domestic presence and capabilities 
we acquired radlinx for total consideration consisting of million in cash at closing plus additional cash consideration to be paid as an earnout within days of the one year anniversary of the closing  which amount will be calculated as of the revenues generated by certain radlinx customers during that period 
as of december   we have recorded an additional liability of million for this contingent consideration 
on february   we acquired teleradiology diagnostic service  inc tds 
we regard the acquisition of tds as a strategic acquisition of an off hours professional radiology services business that is supplemental to our current business and that expands our presence in california 
we purchased tds for an aggregate price of million dollars  of which million was paid in cash at the closing of the acquisition and million to be paid out at the conclusion of the eighteen month escrow period 
on september   we acquired american teleradiology nighthawks  inc atn 
the acquisition of atn was thought of as an acquisition of two distinct businesses i an off hours teleradiology business that was supplemental to our off hours business  and ii nascent hospital business that focused on partnering with radiologists in order to supplement the services they provide to their hospitals 
the consideration that was possibly to be paid to the atn stockholders in connection with the acquisition was based exclusively upon the future financial performance of these two businesses 
specifically  the consideration to the stockholders of atn was to be calculated as follows up front payment  shares of our common stock issued on september   off hours earnout  was recorded as additional consideration in september  to be issued as an estimated  shares of our stock to stockholders of atn as of the acquisition date 
the additional consideration was calculated in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement as the amount equal to a the quotient obtained by dividing i revenue generated by the off hours teleradiology business from atn customers during the twelve month period ended september  by ii which was the value per share of our common stock on the date of completion of the acquisition as agreed by the parties minus b  which was the number of shares of our common stock issued to the stockholders of atn at the completion of the acquisition 
hospital earnout if the hospital business proved to be profitable in the months following the acquisition  additional shares of our common stock were to be issued in an amount equal to the sum of a the quotient obtained by dividing i earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  generated by the hospital business during the twelve month period ending march  by ii  which was the value per share of our common stock on the date of completion of the acquisition as agreed by the parties  plus b the quotient obtained by dividing a three times x the ebitda amount described in clause i by b the fair market value of our common stock  determined on a per share basis  on march  during the quarter ended march   we determined that the hospital business did not generate any ebitda and  thus  that no amount was earned for the second component of the contingent consideration 
both components of the contingent consideration amount are currently subject to dispute and are being negotiated between the former stockholders of atn and our management 
although the company does not believe that additional shares will be issued as part of the hospital business earnout described above  the contingent consideration components ultimately due is subject to resolution of this dispute and agreement by the parties 
the  shares of common stock that were issued at the completion of the acquisition were recorded at par value as common stock with additional amounts up to fair value recorded as additional paid in capital 
the shares  if any  that may be issued as a result of negotiation between the parties will be recorded in a similar manner upon resolution 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and 
table of contents assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  use of estimates  purchase accounting and long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets  income taxes  derivative accounting  and accounting for redeemable preferred stock 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we enter into services contracts with our customers that typically have a one year term  and automatically renew for each successive year unless terminated by the customer or by us 
the amount we charge for our radiology services varies by customer based on a number of factors  including the hours of coverage we provide for the customer  the number of interpretations we provide to the customer and the technical and administrative services we provide to the customer 
we recognize revenue when we have satisfied all of our significant contractual obligations to our customers and we determine that the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized in the fiscal month in which the radiological interpretation is complete and forwarded to the customer 
we review our historical collection experience on a quarterly basis to determine the necessity of a provision for doubtful accounts 
as of december  and  we had reserved million and million  respectively  for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the collectibility of outstanding receivables as of that date 
stock based compensation physician stock based compensation 
we record share based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  or other issuance of shares of common stock to our affiliated radiologists 
we calculate the share based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options to our affiliated radiologists in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf  by determining the fair value using a black scholes model 
in accordance with eitf  because our radiologists are independent contractors  we calculate the fair value of the share based compensation expense in each period 
the expense amount is determined by calculating the fair 
table of contents value of the shares earned in each period and recording that amount as expense during such period 
if the price of our common stock increases over a given period  this accounting treatment results in compensation expense that exceeds the expense we would have recorded if these individuals were employees 
stock based compensation to our affiliated radiologists is included in professional services expense 
non physician stock based compensation 
we also record stock based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  warrants or other issuance of shares of common stock to employees  directors and non physician contractors 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to our employees  directors and non physician contractors in accordance with sfas no 
r by determining the fair value using a black scholes model 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock units or shares of our common stock to our employees  directors and non physician contractors based on the fair value of our common stock on the date the restricted stock units or shares are issued 
stock based compensation to employees and non physician contractors is included in sales  general and administrative expense 
determination of fair value of our stock options 
as indicated above  we record stock based compensation expense associated with our stock options in accordance with sfas r and eitf  as applicable  which require us to calculate the expense associated with our stock options by determining the fair value of the options 
to determine the fair value of our stock options  we use a black scholes model which takes into account the exercise price of the stock option  the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock option  as measured on the date of grant or at each reporting date for grants to non employees that require future service  and an estimation of the volatility of the common stock underlying the stock option 
use of estimates on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates relating to the items described below 
we generally base our estimates on our historical experience which is limited and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable along with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable allowance 
we monitor customer payments and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
in estimating the reserve  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable from a specific customer when we become aware of circumstances that may impair the customer s ability to meet its financial obligations and record an allowance against amounts due 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties in collecting payments from our customers and only began maintaining a reserve for potential customer nonpayment during we believe that the potential aggregate amount of nonpayment by our customers is limited in part by the frequency of our billing cycle and the ease with which we may discontinue service to customers during periods of nonpayment 
however  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates due to our limited experience in establishing reserves for nonpayment  our limited history of non collection  and the difficulty in predicting the future payment practices of a large number of customers 
fair value of redeemable preferred stock conversion feature 
prior to the date of our initial public offering  our estimates of the fair value of our redeemable preferred stock conversion feature were determined by management 
however  because our outstanding redeemable preferred stock converted into common stock at the closing of our initial public offering  we will not record any additional charges associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature after such date 
as a result  since the closing of our initial public offering  we are no longer required to make these estimates 
loss contingency for medical liability claims 
we record a loss contingency for a medical liability claim in the month in which we deem such liability to be probable 
our determination of the probability of the liability is based upon a review of the claim by our executive staff  legal counsel and insurance carrier 
upon the 
table of contents determination that the liability is probable  we record a loss contingency for the claim up to the amount of the deductible specified in our medical liability insurance policy 
to date  we have not experienced any liabilities for claims that were in excess of our prior loss contingency estimates for such claims 
however  actual future losses from medical liability claims may differ from our estimates to the extent that we suffer an adverse determination for a claim that we did not deem the liability probable  did not record a loss contingency up to the maximum amount of our insurance deductible  or do not have insurance coverage or indemnification rights 
incurred but not reported claims 
starting in  we started using actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term industry trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial and legislative decisions  and economic conditions 
our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time 
purchase accounting and long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets the acquisitions of the mps  ers  radlinx  tds and atn businesses were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed in sfas accordingly  purchase accounting adjustments have been reflected in our financial statements for all periods subsequent to the respective purchase dates 
the purchase accounting entries are reflected on our financial statements as of the purchase date 
in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  business combinations sfas  we have revalued the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the acquisitions of mps  ers  radlinx  tds  and atn at their respective fair values 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and intangible assets might be impaired 
amortized other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
sfas requires impairment losses to be recognized for long lived assets through operations when indicators of impairment exist and the underlying cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s carrying value 
in addition  sfas requires that a long lived asset disposal group to be sold that meets certain recognition criteria be classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas also requires that a long lived asset subject to closure abandonment before the end of its previously estimated useful life continue to be classified as held and used until disposal  with depreciation estimates revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed 
potential indicators of impairment can include  but are not limited to history of operating losses or expected future losses  significant adverse change in legal factors  changes in the extent or manner in which the assets are used  current expectations to dispose of the assets by sale or other means  and reductions or expected reductions of cash flow 
if we determine there is an indication of 
table of contents impairment  we compare undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying value of the respective asset 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  we perform an impairment calculation using discounted cash flows  valuation analyses or comparisons to recent sales or purchase transactions to determine estimated fair value 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
this standard requires  among other things  the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires that we recognize only the impact of tax positions that  based on their technical merits  are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority 
fin also specifies standards for estimating and recognizing interest income and expense associated with the tax positions 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential tax exposure items  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowances we deem necessary to value deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
derivative accounting in accordance with us gaap  we recognize all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we designate at inception whether the derivative contract is considered hedging or non hedging in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in its fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
during  we entered into two interest rate swap contracts with a combined notional amount of  in connection with our outstanding debt 
the contracts expire on september  and  respectively 
the contracts were initiated to maintain compliance with debt requirements and to protect us against changes in the interest payments associated with its variable rate long term debt  and therefore are considered cash flow hedges 
as a result  as long as the swap is deemed highly effective  changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded as either an asset a gain position  or a liability a loss position on the balance sheet  with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
accounting for redeemable preferred stock we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas we record derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  measured at fair value 
we record the change in fair value of such instruments as non cash gains or losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes 
on march   in connection with the organization and capitalization of nighthawk radiology holdings  inc  we issued  shares of redeemable preferred stock for a total consideration of million 
each share of redeemable preferred stock was convertible  at the option of the holder  into one share of 
table of contents common stock 
the conversion feature of the redeemable preferred stock was considered an embedded derivative under the provisions of sfas  and accordingly was accounted for separately from the redeemable preferred stock 
we determined the fair value of the redeemable preferred stock conversion feature based upon the fair value of the underlying common stock 
on the date of issuance  the estimated fair value of the conversion feature was million which was recorded as a liability on the date of issuance  thus reducing the recorded value of the redeemable preferred stock to million 
at each balance sheet date  we adjusted the carrying value of the embedded derivative to estimated fair value and recognized the change in such estimated value in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also classified the redeemable preferred stock as mezzanine equity 
as such  we accreted the carrying value of such stock to its redemption value using the effective interest method through the redemption period 
in addition  the redeemable preferred stock accrued dividends since the date of issuance 
we recognized these two types of accretion of redeemable preferred stock in our consolidated statement of operations as a decrease in net income available to common stockholders 
at the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into common stock 
as a result  beginning at the closing of the initial public offering we have not recorded any additional charge associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature 
effective february   the amount reported as fair value of the redeemable preferred stock conversion feature was reclassified to additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
also  the rights of the holders of redeemable preferred stock to receive accrued dividends or to exercise redemption rights terminated 
as a result  the accretion of redeemable preferred stock also terminated 
these amounts were reclassified to stockholders equity 
how we generate revenue historically  we have generated substantially all of our revenue from the professional radiology services that we provide our customers 
we typically provide these services pursuant to one year services contracts that automatically renew for each successive year unless terminated by the customer or by us 
the amount we charge for our radiology services varies by customer based upon a number of factors  including the hours of coverage we provide for the customer  the number of interpretations we perform for the customer and the technical and administrative services we provide to the customer 
more recently  through our acquisition of midwest physician services announced on july   we have expanded our service offerings for radiology groups to include business services such as revenue cycle management  human resources services  facilities management  accounting and financial services  transcription services  records management  operational support  and quality assurance program support 
we also license the use of our proprietary clinical workflow technology to customers which includes both hosted applications and related services such as implementation setup  training  report customization and monitoring 
we recognize revenue generated by our professional and business services during the month in which services are provided and we bill our customers at the beginning of the following month 
because the invoices are typically paid directly by our customers  we do not currently depend upon any material payments by third party payors or patients 
since our first full year of operations  we have experienced significant revenue growth  from million in to million in this growth in revenue resulted primarily from an increase in our customer base  an increase in utilization of our services by our customers  acquisitions  
table of contents an expansion of services offered  an expansion of our service hours  a high customer retention rate  and growth in the use of diagnostic imaging technologies and procedures in the healthcare industry 
for the full year  our exam volumes reached more than million and our affiliated radiologists were providing services to more than customers serving nearly  hospitals 
the total number of hospitals we cover represents approximately of all hospitals in the united states 
most of our current customers contract with us for a limited set of professional services 
there is significant opportunity among our customer base to cross sell our services to expand the types of professional services we provide to customers and also to begin providing clinical workflow technology and business services to those customers 
our operating expenses our operating expenses consist primarily of professional services expense  sales  general and administrative expense  interest expense and income tax expense 
we record stock compensation expense in connection with equity issuances to our affiliated radiologists which we refer to as physician stock based compensation and in connection with equity issuances to our employees  directors and non physician contractors which we refer to as non physician stock based compensation 
in our consolidated statements of operations  we present our physician stock based compensation expense as part of our professional services expenses and our non physician stock based compensation as part of our sales  general and administrative expense 
professional services expense 
professional service expenses consist primarily of the fees we pay to affiliated radiologists  any physician stock based compensation  the premiums for medical liability insurance  and any medical liability claims loss expenses 
affiliated radiologists are independent contractors compensated using a formula that is generally based upon the number of hours worked  with additional incentives for the workload completed as well as year end discretionary bonuses 
professional services expenses are recognized in the month in which the services are performed 
malpractice expense 
we recognize expenses associated with medical liability premiums in the month in which the expense is incurred 
we record reserves for both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr amounts 
reported amounts are reserved based upon our best estimate of future probable costs 
ibnr claims are estimated by a third party using historical claims lag information received by our third party claims administrator and industry indices 
this reserve is intended to cover potential medical claims that might arise related to all of the radiological interpretations performed by our affiliated radiologists since inception 
physician stock based compensation expense 
as described previously  we record physician stock based compensation expense in connection with any stock options  restricted stock units or other issuance of shares of our common stock to our affiliated radiologists and present this expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of our professional services expense 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to affiliated radiologists in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf no 
sales  general and administrative expense 
sales  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for all employees and non physician contractors  non physician stock based compensation  information technology and telecommunications expenses  costs associated with licensing and privileging our affiliated radiologists  facilities and office related expenses  sales and marketing expenses and other general and administrative expenses 

table of contents non physician stock based compensation expense 
as described previously  we record non physician stock based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  warrants or other issuance of shares of our common stock to our employees  directors and non physician contractors and present this expense in our consolidated statement of income as part of our sales  general and administrative expense 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to our employees  directors and non physician contractors in accordance with sfas no 
r 
our non operating expenses in addition to our operating expenses  we record the following non operating expenses 
interest expense 
the interest expense we incur in a given period is directly attributable to the principal amount of debt we have outstanding during such period 
change in fair value of redeemable preferred stock conversion feature 
we entered into a stockholders agreement with the holders of our series a preferred stock pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase all or any portion of the shares of redeemable preferred stock then held by such holders at any time after seven years from the date of issuance 
the redemption provision in the stockholders agreement  which terminated upon the closing of our initial public offering  provided that the repurchase price for such shares of redeemable preferred stock would be the greater of i the market value of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the redeemable preferred stock or ii the liquidation value of such shares of redeemable preferred stock including all accrued and unpaid dividends 
the conversion feature of the redeemable preferred stock was considered an embedded derivative under the provisions of sfas no 
 and accordingly was accounted for separately from the redeemable preferred stock 
on the date of issuance  the estimated fair value of the conversion feature was million which was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet date on the date of issue thus reducing the recorded value of the redeemable preferred stock to million 
while these shares remained outstanding  on each balance sheet date subsequent to the execution of that agreement  we adjusted the carrying value of the embedded derivative to estimated fair value and recognized the change in such estimated value in our consolidated statements of operations 
at the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into shares of common stock  and  as a result  we do not record any additional expenses associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature of our redeemable preferred stock after such date 
income tax expense 
we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with fas this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
redeemable preferred stock accretion 
shares of our redeemable preferred stock accrued dividends from the date of issuance until their conversion into shares of common stock at the closing of our initial public offering 
the redeemable preferred stock dividends were cumulative and accrued at a rate of per annum based on the sum of the liquidation value of each share of redeemable preferred stock   plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends 
dividends accumulated at the end of each calendar quarter 
in addition to accruing dividends  we also accrued the carrying amount of the redeemable preferred stock to its redemption value using the effective interest method through the redemption period 
we recognized these two types of accretion of redeemable preferred stock in our consolidated statements of operations as a decrease in net income available to common stockholders 
at the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into shares of common stock and the rights of the holders of redeemable preferred stock to receive accrued dividends or to exercise redemption rights terminated 
as a result  the accretion relating to our redeemable preferred stock also terminated 
these amounts are now reported within stockholders equity 

table of contents trends in our business and results of operations revenue trends 
our business has grown rapidly since inception 
this growth has been driven by an increase in our customer base  an increase in utilization of our service by our customers  acquisitions  an expansion of services offered  an expansion of our service hours  a high customer retention rate and the growth in the use of diagnostic imaging technologies and procedures in the healthcare industry 
our strategy is to expand on our position as the leading provider of radiology services by continuing to expand our service offerings in final and sub specialty interpretations  cardiac imaging services and business process services  expanding our radiology group customers utilization of our services as they implement coverage of additional hospitals  targeting new customers  pursuing both strategic and tactical acquisitions  and developing markets for our data and technology solutions 
our revenue has increased in absolute dollars each year since inception and our revenue growth rate has been strong year over year 
our fourth quarter and full year revenues grew and respectively  compared to the same periods in we expect that a number of our customers will implement our new service offerings  continue to implement coverage for additional hospitals as well as continue to use additional hours of our service  resulting in an overall increase in the utilization of our service by those customers 
volume and revenue trends are driven by continuing growth in imaging demand  strong customer retention and recurring revenue streams  and expanded service offerings 
historically  we have seen an increase in exam volumes during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  when weather conditions tend to be warmer in much of the united states and our customers take greater advantage of our coverage 
during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  when weather conditions are colder for a large portion of the united states  we have historically experienced relatively lower exam volumes than those experienced during the second and third quarters 
we expect this seasonality to continue 
a summary of our historical volumes is as follows quarter year total volumes growth rates acquisition contribution first months sequential year over year dayhawk atn tds radlinx q  q  q  q   fy  q   q   q   q    fy  q   q   q   q  fy  q   q    q    q    fy  
table of contents trends in professional service fees 
since inception  our professional service fees have increased in absolute dollars each year  primarily due to the addition of new radiologists to perform an increased workload as our business has grown 
we expect that our professional service fees will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we contract with additional radiologists to meet the increasing demand for our services  as we begin to offer additional services  and as a result of scheduled increases in hourly fees under our existing agreements with our affiliated radiologists 
we expect our margins to improve and professional services expense to decline as a percentage of revenue compared to current levels as we integrate our recent acquisitions and as our new affiliated radiologists productivity improves 
trends in medical liability expense 
our medical liability expense has also increased in absolute dollars each year since inception  primarily due to increases in our medical liability premiums as our business has grown and our reporting of ibnr 
we expect our medical liability premiums and our ibnr expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as our business continues to grow 
in addition  if we have claims in future periods for which we deem a liability to be probable  our medical liability expense may increase 
trends in physician stock based compensation expense 
the amount of physician stock based compensation expense we record in a given period depends primarily on the number of shares subject to outstanding options held by our affiliated radiologists  the number of hours worked  and the change in the value of our common stock in that period 
because of the accounting treatment required by eitf  if the value of our common stock increases over a given period  we will record a compensation expense that generally exceeds the expense we would have recorded if these individuals were employees because eitf requires us to record the increase in the value of the option during such period as an expense 
our expense in future periods for physician stock based compensation will be driven primarily by new equity based grants we make to our affiliated radiologists  the rate at which those equity awards and the currently outstanding options are earned over such periods  as well as changes  if any  in our stock price during such periods 
trends in sales  general and administrative expense 
our sales  general and administrative expense has increased in absolute dollars each year since inception primarily as a result of increased payroll expenses in connection with the addition of key management personnel and general headcount necessary to support our growth 
our employee headcount increased from at december  to at december  we expect that payroll expenses will continue to rise as we increase headcount at all levels of our business as we continue to grow 
in addition to rising payroll expense  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to increases in telecommunications and information technology costs  licensing and privileging costs and increased accounting  legal and consulting costs

if a weakening us dollar requires us to increase the amounts we pay to our affiliated radiologists in the future in order to maintain a constant level of compensation denominated in us dollars  our results of operations and cash flows could be affected
