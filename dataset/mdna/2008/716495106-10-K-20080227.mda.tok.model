item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our current financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  production and exploration of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the united states 
we focus on properties within our core operating areas which we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities 
our properties are primarily located in the mid continent region  including north louisiana  the fayetteville shale in the arkoma basin of arkansas and in the western region  including the permian basin of west texas and southeastern new mexico 
at december   our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves were approximately  bcfe  consisting of mmbbls of oil  and bcfe of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed 
we maintain operational control of approximately of our proved reserves 
we focus on maintaining a portfolio of long lived  lower risk properties in resource style plays  which typically are characterized by lower geological risk and a large inventory of identified drilling opportunities 
we believe the steps we have taken during will help us grow production and reserves in resource style  tight gas areas in north louisiana and arkansas 
our current drilling inventory consists of approximately  identified locations   of which are resource style 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and natural gas and our ability to market our production 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and natural gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine the effect increases or decreases in future prices will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are also critical to our long term success

index to financial statements capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in  and were from operating and financing activities 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and cash received from operations as well as divestitures in those years were offset by cash used in investing activities to complete our acquisition and ongoing drilling activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see comparison of results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to our increase in production volumes primarily due to our merger with kcs in july  as well as our increase in our realized natural gas equivalent price 
we will have a production decline in associated with the sale of our gulf coast properties which we expect to be partially offset by production increases from the fayetteville shale and our north louisiana properties 
in addition  we are also unable to predict future commodity prices 
as a result  we are unable to predict future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to our increase in production volumes as a result of our acquisition activities as well as our continued drilling success 
also contributing to this increase was our success in reducing our operating costs on a per unit basis as we lowered our lease operating expense to per mcfe in from per mcfe in the increase was partially offset by a decrease in our realized natural gas equivalent price compared to net cash provided by operating activities in increased million from this increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices and an increase in sales volumes in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of mission in july  as well as our acquisition of proton oil and gas corporation proton in february and the inclusion of a full year of production for wynn crosby which we acquired in november average realized prices increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in production volumes increased  mmcfe from  mmcfe in to  mmcfe in investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities was capital spending  inclusive of acquisitions and net of divestitures 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program 
we participated in the drilling of gross wells in  of which were dry holes  for a success rate of

we have budgeted million in capital expenditures for critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee
