item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes many forward looking statements 
for cautions about relying on such forward looking statements  please refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report immediately prior to item general we design  manufacture  market and sell high performance infrastructure products for wireless voice and data applications 
our products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the united states which support voice and data communications by use of cell phones and other wireless communication devices 
our products help maximize the performance of wireless telecommunications networks by improving the quality of uplink signals from mobile wireless devices 
our products increase capacity utilization  lower dropped and blocked calls  extend coverage  and enable higher wireless data throughput all while reducing capital and operating costs 
our superlink solution utilizes patented high temperature superconductor hts technology to create a receiver front end that enhances network performance 
today  we are leveraging our expertise and proprietary technology in radio frequency rf engineering to continue to expand our product line beyond hts technology 
we believe our rf engineering expertise provides us with a significant competitive advantage in the development of high performance  cost effective solutions for wireless telecommunications networks 
we have three product offerings superlink 
in order to receive uplink signals from wireless handsets  base stations require a wireless filter system to eliminate out of band interference 
superlink combines hts filters with a proprietary cryogenic cooler and an ultra low noise amplifier 
the result is a highly compact and reliable receiver front end that can simultaneously deliver both high selectivity interference rejection and high sensitivity detection of low level signals 
superlink delivers significant performance advantages over conventional filter systems 
amplink 
amplink is designed to address the sensitivity requirements of wireless base stations 
amplink is a ground mounted unit which utilizes a high performance amplifier 
the enhanced uplink performance provided by amplink improves network coverage immediately and avoids the installation and maintenance costs associated with tower mounted alternatives 
superplex 
superplex is our line of multiplexers that provides extremely low insertion loss and excellent cross band isolation 
superplex high performance multiplexers are designed to eliminate the need for additional base station antennas and reduce infrastructure costs 
relative to competing technologies  these products offer increased transmit power delivered to the base station antenna  higher sensitivity to subscriber handset signals  and fast and cost effective network overlays 
we currently sell most of our commercial products directly to wireless network operators in the united states 
our customers to date include alltel  cingular  sprint nextel  t mobile  us cellular and verizon wireless 
we have a concentrated customer base 
verizon wireless and at t each accounted for more than of our commercial revenues in and verizon wireless  alltel  and t mobile each accounted for more than of our commercial revenues in we plan to expand our customer base by selling directly to other wireless network operators and manufacturers of base station equipment  but we cannot assure that this effort will be successful 
we also generate significant revenues from government contracts 
we primarily pursue government research and development contracts which compliment our commercial product development 
we undertake government contract work which has the potential to improve our commercial product offering 
these contracts often yield valuable intellectual property relevant to our commercial business 
we typically own the intellectual property developed under these contracts  and the federal government receives a royalty free  non exclusive and nontransferable license to use the intellectual property for the united states 
we sell most of our products to a small number of wireless carriers  and their demand for wireless communications equipment fluctuates dramatically and unpredictably 
we expect these trends to continue and may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues 

table of contents the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence  evolving industry standards and price erosion over the life of a product 
we face constant pressures to reduce prices 
consequently  we expect the average selling prices of our products will continue decreasing over time 
we have responded in the past by successfully reducing our product costs  and expect further cost reductions over the next twelve months 
however  we cannot predict whether our costs will decline at a rate sufficient to keep pace with the competitive pricing pressures 
recent developments baoli investment 
under a previously announced investment agreement with hunchun baoli communication co 
ltd  or baoli  in august  on february   we issued to baoli and two related purchasers a total of a  shares of our common stock of which  must be voted in accordance with the votes of our other shares  effectively giving baoli no voting power over such shares and b  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  or series a preferred convertible under certain conditions into  shares of our common stock 
we received million in cash  of which million was funded in and the million balance was funded in january subject to the terms and conditions of our series a preferred and to customary adjustments to the conversion rate  each share of our series a preferred is convertible into ten shares of our common stock so long as the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by baoli following such conversion does not exceed of our outstanding common stock 
except for a preference on liquidation of 
per share  each share of series a preferred is the economic equivalent of the ten shares of common stock into which it is convertible 
except as required by law  the series a preferred will not have any voting rights 
for a complete description of the terms of the series a preferred  please see the certificate of designations  a copy of which is available through our website at www 
suptech 
com or in our sec filings available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov 
with the issuance of the series a preferred  our ability to declare or pay dividends on shares of our common stock will be subject to the requirement that we pay an equivalent dividend on each outstanding share of series a preferred on an as converted basis 
baoli joint venture 
we and baoli continue to work on our recently established joint venture to manufacture and market our superlink interference elimination solution for the china market 
as previously announced  our agreements provide that baoli will provide the manufacturing expertise and financing in exchange for percent of the equity and we will provide an exclusive license in the china market of the enabling technology in exchange for percent of the equity and a royalty on sales 
we continue to work on preliminary matters relating to the joint venture  including administrative and logistical matters  exploratory marketing initiatives  technical and market analysis and discussions with governmental officials 
the commencement of manufacturing and any actual sales by the joint venture  and the transfer of our technology to the joint venture  remain subject to success in these efforts and to a number of other conditions including certain critical approvals from the chinese and united states governments 
in particular  we are in discussions with the committee on foreign investment in the united states or cfius  an inter agency committee of the united states government that reviews the national security implications of foreign acquisitions of us companies regarding our joint venture with and investment from baoli 
there continues to be no assurance that these conditions will be met  or that all required approvals if obtained will be obtained on a timely basis 
even if these conditions are met and the approvals received  the results from our joint venture will be subject to a number of significant risks associated with international operations and new ventures which are similar to those involved in acquisitions  some of which are set out in our public filings  including in particular the risk factors included in item a of this document 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  recovery of long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contract revenue and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained or disposed 
our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or otherwise disposed 
such provisions are established based on historical usage  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted 
we indemnify  without limit or term  our customers against all claims  suits  demands  damages  liabilities  expenses  judgments  settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims arising from our products 
we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our guarantees because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how much it might total 
contract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts 
contract revenues are recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
if the current contract estimate were to indicate a loss  utilizing the funded amount of the contract  a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss 
contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the united states government 
credit risk related to accounts receivable arising 
table of contents from such contracts is considered minimal 
these contracts include cost plus  fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short term in nature 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the defense contract audit agency 
based on historical experience and review of current projects in process  we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the defense contract audit agency has audited us through in connection with the acquisition of conductus we recognized million of goodwill 
at july   our market capitalization had declined to million  an amount less than our total book value 
we concluded that our declining stock price constituted an event under fas and required us to test for goodwill impairment as of july  we then proceeded with step two of the impairment analysis determining the fair values of all our tangible and intangible assets and then aggregating and subtracting these values from our fair value 
our analysis led us to reasonably estimate at that time that our fair market value was less than our net assets excluding goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a full write down of the goodwill million in the second quarter we periodically evaluate the realizability of long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
long lived assets that will no longer be used in business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for us 
periodically  long lived assets that will continue to be used by we need to be evaluated for recoverability 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
in the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets  the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
our future cash flows may vary from estimates 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no

under this provision  the share based compensation cost recognized beginning january  includes compensation cost for i all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for stock options and other stock based employee awards 
pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share  as calculated under the provisions of sfas  are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
we accounted for equity securities issued to non employees in accordance with the provision of sfas and emerging issues task force prior to  we did not recognize compensation expense for issuance of stock options to employees 
if we had elected to recognize compensation expense for employee awards prior to based upon the fair value at the 
table of contents grant date consistent with the methodology prescribed by sfas  our net loss and net loss per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss as reported stock based employee compensation included in net loss stock based compensation expense determined under fair value method pro forma basic and diluted loss per share as reported stock based compensation expense determined under fair value method pro forma on december   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all time vested outstanding out of the money stock options held by current employees or consultants 
for this purpose  the compensation committee defined out of the money options as options having an exercise price equal to or greater than per share the market price on the date of the committee s decision to accelerate the vesting 
if we had elected to recognize compensation expense for employee awards  the pro forma cost impact of these accelerated options in would have been million 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods 
if and when we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
we have a contract to deliver several custom products to a government contractor 
we are unable to manufacture the products for technical reasons 
we have discussed the problem with the contractor and its government customer 
they are considering the problem  and we expect further discussions 
we do not believe that a loss is reasonably estimable at this time and therefore have not recorded any liability relating to this matter 
we will periodically reassess our potential liability as additional information becomes available 
if we later determine that a loss is probable and the amount reasonably estimable  we would record a liability for the potential loss 
backlog our commercial backlog consists of accepted product purchase orders with scheduled delivery dates during the next twelve months 
we had commercial backlog of  at december   as compared to  at december  results of operations compared to net revenues decreased by million  or  from million in to million in net revenues consist primarily of commercial product revenues and government contract revenues

this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of new or amended contracts in cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs  manufacturing overhead  provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
the cost of commercial product revenues totaled million for as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the lower costs resulted principally from lower production as a result of lower sales 
there was also no restructuring expenses in and a lower provision for obsolete inventory 
our provision for obsolete inventories totaled  in as compared to  in our cost of sales includes both variable and fixed cost components 
the variable component consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs and warranty costs 
the fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments

our gross margins were also adversely impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margins were favorably impacted by  in and  in by the sale of previously written off inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and provide an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory based on numerous factors including sales backlog  historical inventory usage  forecasted product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months

we have effective registration statements on file with the sec covering the public resale by investors of all the common stock issued in our private placements  as well as any common stock acquired upon exercise of their warrants 
we have an existing line of credit from a bank 
it is a material source of funds for our business 
the line of credit expires in july the loan agreement is structured as a sale of our accounts receivable and provides for the sale of up to million of eligible accounts receivable  with advances to us totaling of the receivables sold 
advances bear interest at the prime rate at december  plus subject to a minimum monthly charge 
advances are collateralized by a lien on all of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we continue to service the sold receivables and are subject to recourse provisions 
there was no amount outstanding under this borrowing facility at december  in and  we did not complete a financing transaction 
however  on august   we entered into the previously noted investment agreement with baoli and on february   the transactions contemplated by this investment agreement closed and in exchange for million in cash we issued to baoli and two related purchasers a total of a  shares of our common stock and b  shares of our series a preferred stock convertible under certain conditions into  shares of our common stock 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
they consist of the following operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations consist of a facility lease in santa barbara  california and several copier leases 
patents and licenses we have entered into various licensing agreements requiring royalty payments ranging from to of specified product sales 
some of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments in the normal course of business  we incur purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us 
quantitative summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases minimum license commitment fixed asset and inventory purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations capital expenditures we plan to invest approximately  in fixed assets during future liquidity our principal sources of liquidity consist of existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations 
we believe one of the key factors to our liquidity will be our ability to successfully execute on our plans to increase sales levels in a highly concentrated industry where we experience significant fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter 
our cash requirements will also depend on numerous other variable factors  including the rate of growth of sales  the timing and levels of products purchased  payment terms and credit limits from manufacturers  and the timing and level of accounts receivable collections

net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts million and million  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
included in the net operating loss carryforwards are deductions related to stock options of approximately million and million for federal and california income tax purposes  respectively 
to the extent net operating loss carryforwards are recognized for accounting purposes the resulting benefits related to the stock options will be credited to stockholders equity 
in addition  we had research and development and other tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts  and  respectively resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying balance sheet 
section of the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return usually the applicable federal funds rate  as defined in the internal revenue code and the value of the corporation at the time of a change of ownership as defined by section we had changes in ownership in august and december therefore  the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards of million incurred prior to the ownership changes will be subject in future periods to an annual limitation of million 
in addition  we acquired the right to conductus net operating losses  which are also subject to the limitations imposed by section conductus underwent three ownership changes  which occurred in february  february and december therefore  the ability to utilize conductus net operating loss carryforwards of million incurred prior to the ownership changes will be subject in future periods to annual limitation of  net operating losses incurred by us subsequent to the ownership changes totaled million and are not subject to this limitation 
we are currently evaluating the potential limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the recent investment by baoli
