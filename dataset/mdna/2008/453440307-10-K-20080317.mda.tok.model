the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis 
insurance premium revenue recognition and policy charges life traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits  primarily term and whole life insurance products 
premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due 
annuities and interest sensitive life contracts  such as universal life and interest sensitive whole life  are contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed 
premiums from these policies are reported as funds on deposit 
policy charges consist of fees assessed against the policyholder for cost of insurance mortality risk  policy administration and early surrender 
these revenues are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
policies that do not subject the company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are considered investment contracts 
deposits received from such contracts are reported as other policyholder funds 
policy charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the policyholder account for maintenance  administration and surrender of the policy prior to contractually specified dates  and are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
health premiums for short duration medical insurance contracts are intended to cover expected claim costs resulting from insured events that occur during a fixed period of short duration 
the company has the ability to cancel the annual contract or to revise the premium rates at the beginning of each annual contract period to cover future insured events 
insurance premiums from annual health contracts are collected monthly and are recognized as revenue evenly as insurance protection is provided 
premiums related to long term and short term disability contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal  other fees  and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment function for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
loss reserves differ for short duration and long duration insurance policies  including annuities 
reserves are based on approved actuarial methods  but necessarily include assumptions about expenses  mortality  morbidity  lapse rates and future yield on related investments 
all of the company s short duration contracts are generated from its accident and health business  and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
life for traditional life insurance products  the company computes insurance reserves primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality  and withdrawals 
these methods are widely used in the life insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance reserves 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates that could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating results 
actual results may differ  and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change 
policyholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products  such as universal life  interest sensitive life and annuities 
policyholder funds are comprised primarily of deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the policyholder less surrenders and withdrawals  mortality charges and administrative expenses 
interest credited interest credited to policyholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest sensitive life policies and investment policies 
amounts charged to operations including interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances are reported as insurance benefits  claims and reserves life and annuity 
credit rates for certain annuities and interest sensitive life policies are adjusted periodically by the company to reflect current market conditions  subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates 
health the company believes that its recorded insurance reserves are reasonable and adequate to satisfy its ultimate liability 
the company primarily uses its own loss development experience  but will also supplement that with data from its outside actuaries  reinsurers and industry loss experience as warranted 
to illustrate the impact that loss ratios have on the company s loss reserves and related expenses  each hypothetical change in the loss ratio for the health business ie  the ratio of insurance benefits  claims and settlement expenses to earned health premiums for the year ended december   would increase reserves in the case of a higher ratio or decrease reserves in the case of a lower ratio by approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
depending on the circumstances surrounding a change in the loss ratio  other pre tax amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations could also be affected  such as amortization of deferred acquisition costs and commission expense 
the company s health reserves by segment are as follows in thousands december  claim policy total health reserves claims reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability individual a h and other december  claim policy total health reserves claims reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability individual a h and other medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss segment is comprised of employer stop loss  hmo reinsurance and provider excess 
all of the company s medical stop loss policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
the two primary assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is set using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years which deviated by  and net loss ratio points  respectively 
after the recorded reserve increase  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to the company s underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected net loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
reserves for hmo reinsurance and provider excess are adjusted on a policy by policy basis 
because of the small number of hmo reinsurance and provider excess policies it writes  the company is able to evaluate each policy individually for potential liability by reviewing open claims with each hmo or provider group and applying completion factors using historical data 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns tend to be representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims  and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
group disability the company s group disability segment is comprised of long term disability ltd and disability benefits law dbl 
the two primary assumptions on which group disability reserves are based are i morbidity levels  and ii recovery rates 
if morbidity levels increase  for example due to an epidemic or a recessionary environment  the company would increase reserves because there would be more new claims than expected 
in regard to the assumed recovery rate  if disabled lives recover more quickly than anticipated then the existing claims reserves would be reduced  if less quickly  the existing claims reserves would be increased 
advancements in medical treatments could affect future recovery  termination  and mortality rates 
with respect to ltd only  other assumptions are i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in offsets  iii advancements in medical treatments  and iv cost of living 
changes in market interest rates could change reserve assumptions since the payout period could be as long as years 
changes in offsets such as social security benefits  retirement plans and state disability plans also impact reserving 
as a result of the forgoing assumptions  it is possible that the historical trend may not be an accurate predictor of the future development of the block 
as with most long term insurance reserves that require judgment  the reserving process is subject to uncertainty and volatility and fluctuations may not be indicative of the claim development overall 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its primary assumptions would have a material effect 
individual a h and other this segment is a combination of closed lines of business as well as certain small existing lines 
while the assumptions used in setting reserves vary between these different lines of business  the assumptions would generally relate to the following i the rate of disability  ii the morbidity rates on specific diseases  and iii accident rates 
the reported reserves are based on management s best estimate for each line within this segment 
general uncertainties that surround all insurance reserving methodologies would apply 
however  since the company has so few policies of this type  volatility may occur due to the small number of claims 
deferred acquisition costs costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment type contracts are deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
these costs are principally broker fees  agent commissions  and the purchase prices of acquired blocks of business 
dac is amortized to expense and reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
all dac within a particular product type is amortized on the same basis using the following methods life for traditional life insurance and other premium paying policies accounted for under sfas no 
 amortization of dac is charged to expense over the related premium revenue recognition period 
assumptions used in the amortization of dac are determined based upon the conditions as of the date of policy issue or assumption and are not generally revised during the life of the policy 
for long duration type contracts accounted for under sfas no 
 such as annuities and universal life business  amortization of dac is charged to expense over the life of the book of such contracts based on the present value of the estimated gross profits egps expected to be realized over the life of the book of contracts 
egps consist of margins based on expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  and other revenues and expenses 
the company regularly evaluates its egps to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
if the company determines that the current assumptions underlying the egps are no longer the best estimate for the future due to changes in actual versus expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  or other revenues and expenses  the future egps are updated using the new assumpt ions and prospective unlocking occurs 
these updated egps are utilized for future amortization calculations 
the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted through a current charge or credit to the consolidated statement of operations 
health for credit health insurance policies accounted for under sfas no 
 amortization of dac is charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
investments the company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in either accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statements of operation s  using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
the company also had million and million  on average  in trading accounts during and  respectively 
all such trading securities were liquidated at december  and net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as realized losses 
the factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including  in the case of fixed maturities  the effect of changes in market interest rates  an d the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value

equity income from amic equity income from amic in was comparable to fee income and other income fee income increased million to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in administrative fees in the fully insured health segment including an increase of million earned by iac acquired january  in addition to million of fees earned by ihc health solutions  inc acquired january  and amc acquired april  
total other income increased million to million from million in  primarily due to adjustments in in settlement of a reinsurance agreement 
insurance benefits  claims and reserves benefits  claims and reserves increased million 
the increase is mainly due to i an increase of million in the medical stop loss segment  primarily resulting from an increase in claims experience and reserve strengthening of million related to business and million due to an increase in the projected net loss ratio on business  as described in further detail below  and the remainder  as a result of the increase in assumed premiums  and ii an increase of million in the fully insured health segment  primarily due to the increase in volume and adverse development of million related to the year  as described below in reserve strengthening 
reserve strengthening medical stop loss in accordance with our reserving methodology  the company initially establishes its medical stop loss reserves based on its best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  which is set based on underlying assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward projected net loss ratio 
this use of projections reflects the fact that actual claims on medical stop loss cases typically are not fully reported until after the end of the policy period 
we use the projected net loss ratio to set reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
ihc s typical practice is to then increase or decrease claims reserves once we know the actual claims experience 
we then review quarterly the projected net loss ratios and claim development patterns as we develop reserve estimates based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
medical stop loss business is excess coverage with a short duration 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is especially complicated due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies and deficiencies will typically emerge during the following year rather than over a number of years 
consistent with our experience  the industry as a whole has succumbed to the pricing pressures caused by an unexpectedly long down cycle or soft market for medical stop loss business 
the medical stop loss market has been soft for the past four years  including cases written in and  which means that many of the company s competitors have been willing to write business at little or no margin 
we had been aware of these market conditions and had curtailed our growth in order to attempt to achieve higher profit margins 
the company believed that it had taken sufficient action to insure that business written in would produce better margins than that written in and formulated a projected net loss ratio reflecting such expectations 
as is typical with medical stop loss business  mgus do have some discretion with in our underwriting guidelines to make pricing concessions on certain cases  particularly as it relates to maintaining their core renewal business and production sources 
in the third quarter of  during our quarterly review of claim development patterns  we identified a material increase in claims and reserves with respect to business written in such adverse development was primarily driven by the frequency of claims relative to the business written in that year proving significantly higher than what would have been predicted by prior loss development patterns 
this increased frequency of medical stop loss claims was due  in part  to increased severity of primary claims 
the company determined that this increase in claims was an indication of a pattern of higher loss frequency 
while claims related to business written in have not yet developed to a level where claim development patterns would provide reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels  we determined that it was appropriate to re estimate the projected net loss ratio to take into account developing losses with respect to business written in as a result of these actions  the company increased the projected net loss ratio on the business written in by and increased the net loss ratio defined as insurance benefits  claims and reserves divided by premiums earned less underwriting expenses on the business written in by 
this resulted in a charge of million  before income taxes  in primarily relating to the re estimation of unpaid losses from the prior year 
in addition  the company booked higher reserves of million related to the business due to the increase of in the projected net loss ratio from the rate at which new business was reserved for in the company recorded net loss ratios for the medical stop loss line of  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the net loss ratio equation primarily differs from the combined ratio in that it subtracts out expenses from the premiums prior to dividing by the insurance benefits  claims and reserves 
we primarily use net loss ratios from a reserving standpoint and as a management tool to measure the profitability of medical stop loss with respect to each program 
the company primarily uses combined ratios as an accounting measurement for reporting purposes 
fully insured health the adverse development recorded in in the fully insured health segment was largely related to i overestimating the value of certain new initiatives started in that were intended to manage and reduce claims costs  including medical care management services to insureds  negotiation of out of network claims  and auditing provider bills cost containment program  and ii underestimating in the seasonality patterns that are a result of an increasing portion of the business having high deductible health plans hdhps 
although this cost containment program did have a positive impact on the results of the small group major medical line  during the company determined that the impact was not as large as it had anticipated when setting reserves in with respect to the seasonality patterns  hdhps have fewer claims in the first quarter of a p lan year and higher claims in the last quarter of the plan year 
primarily as a result of these two factors during  the company believed that its small group major medical business had significantly better loss ratios than we later determined 
amortization of deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased 
million 
interest expense on debt interest expense increased 
million primarily as a result of a higher average outstanding principal balance and a higher interest rate paid under a line of credit during compared to an average of in compared to in 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to i a million increase in commission and administrative expenses associated with the operation of the fully insured segment  primarily due to a from the acquisitions of cam and amc  b an overall increase in costs of million due to the increase in business reported as sga expenses  previously described  and c a million increase in amortization expenses as a result of the purchase accounting for recent acquisitions  and ii a million increase in commissions and other general expenses in the medical stop loss segment due to higher volume 
income taxes income tax expense decreased million to 
million for from million in  primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income in the decrease in the effective tax rate to in from in is primarily due to a higher ratio of dividend received deductions drd and tax exempt income to pre tax income in compared to although the amount of drd and tax exempt income has not increased substantially  their proportion to pre tax income has due to the decrease in operating income in resulting in a lower effective tax rate in results of operations results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  income from continuing operations was million  or

no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  primarily in the third quarter of  the company recorded reserve strengthening of million primarily related to its medical stop loss business due to emerging claim development patterns 
the adverse development to the claim development patterns was due to the frequency of claims reported in that quarter being significantly higher than had been predicted by prior loss development patterns 
this frequency of medical stop loss claims was due  in part  to the increasing severity of primary claims 
the company determined that this increase in claims was an indication of a pattern of higher loss frequency 
in addition  the company recorded additional reserves of million on its business  primarily as a result of the company s review of the claim development patterns of the business 
this business was reserved using the projected net loss ratio

these investments carry less risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   approximately of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed maturities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any mortgage loans or non performing fixed maturities at december  at december   the company had million invested in whole loan cmos backed by alt a mortgages  all of which were rated aaa 
of this amount  w ere in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in the company s mortgage security portfolio has no exposure to sub prime mortgages

million and 
million  respectively  of realized losses for other than temporary impairments 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled million at december  substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the company holds all fixed maturities as available for sale securities and  accordingly  marks all of its fixed maturities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss

medical stop loss the company experienced net unfavorable development of million in the medical stop loss segment as previously discussed in reserve strengthening 
the net unfavorable development is based on million of negative development in the reserves and million related to prior years 
with respect to the reserves  the deficiency was primarily due to the continuing deterioration of the business underwritten in these increases in reserve estimates are generally the result of on going analysis of recent loss development trends 
in the third quarter of  the company identified a material increase in claims and reserves with respect to business written in such adverse development was primarily driven by the frequency of claims relative to the business written in that year proving significantly higher than what would have been predicted by prior loss development patterns 
this increased frequency of medical stop loss claims was due  in part  to increased severity of primary claims 
fully insured health the company experienced million of net unfavorable development in the fully insured health segment as previously discussed in reserve strengthening 
the adverse development in the fully insured health segment in is based on million largely related to overestimating the value of the cost containment program started in and underestimating in the seasonality patterns that are a result of an increasing portion of the business having hdhps 
the fully insured health line had a favorable variance of 
on the reserves 
group disability the group disability segment had an unfavorable development of 
million 
this amount consists of a favorable development of million on the reserves primarily due to dbl and a net unfavorable development of million for all other years due to ltd 
due to the long term nature of ltd  in establishing loss reserves the company must make estimates for case reserves  incurred but not reported reserves ibnr  and reserves for loss adjustment expenses lae 
case reserves generally equal the company s best estimate of the present value of the liability for future benefits to be paid on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the lae reserve is calculated based on an actuarial expense study 
since the ltd block of policies is relatively small  results can vary from year to year solely on the basis of one or two policies 
it is not uncommon for a reserve of several hundred thousand dollars to be associated with one policy 
if a small number of claimants with large policy reserves were to recover or a few large claims were incurred  the results could distort the company s reser ve estimates from year to year 
however  there were no individual factors in that caused the unfavorable development in ltd 
with respect to dbl  reserves for the most recent quarter of earned premium are established using a net loss ratio methodology 
the net loss ratio is determined by applying the completed prior four quarters of historical net loss ratios to the last quarter of earned premium 
reserves associated with the premium earned prior to the last quarter are established using a completion factor methodology 
the completion factors are developed using the historical payment patterns for dbl 
the favorable development in the dbl line is due to lower than expected claims 
there were no changes in the company s experience factor or the ibnr factor for group disability 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to individual a h and other the individual a h and other segment had favorable development of million 
the company experienced 
million favorable variance related to reserves on our blanket accident and sickness product that is sold to volunteer fire districts  due to lower claims experience than historically experienced 
the company had 
favorable variance on all other individual a h lines related to and prior reserves 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in november  december and march  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively  through pooled trust preferred issuances by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts

ihc enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations  including liabilities for insurance reserves  funds on deposit  debt and operating lease obligations 
however  ihc does not believe that its cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  also will vary based upon ihc s future needs

in the second quarter of  pursuant to terms set forth in the limited liability company agreement of majestic  ihc intends to purchase the remaining of the minority interest currently owned by a senior officer of majestic 
outlook for  ihc s business plan is to i continue to improve the profitability of our fully insured health business  while selectively retaining more risk  ii selectively pursue new fully insured health opportunities that leverage our vertically integrated strategy of generating fee income at multiple levels of marketing and administration  as well as risk profit and profit commission income  iii continue to improve the profitability of our medical stop loss business  iv expand distribution of our life and disability products and add new life and critical illness products  and v continue to acquire blocks of life and annuity business the following summarizes what ihc has accomplish ed and the outlook for and beyond by segment 
historic core lines of business ihc has historically been a life and health insurance holding company for two insurance companies  standard security life insurance company of new york standard security life and madison national life insurance company  inc madison national life  which relied on independent general agents  managing general underwriters mgus and administrators to perform the majority of all marketing  underwriting  claims and administrative functions for our two primary product segments medical stop loss and group disability  life  annuities and dbl 
while it is always our intent to emphasize underwriting profits and not top line growth  the medical stop loss industry as a whole succumbed to pricing pressures caused by an unexpectedly long down cycle or soft market from through as a consequence of these market conditions  we curtailed our growth  and believed that we had taken sufficient action to insure that business written in would produce better margins than that written in unfortunately  certain of our mgus exercised discretion within our underwriting guidelines to make pricing concessions on particular cases  which ultimately resulted in business incepting in having higher loss ratios than that incepting in we recorded gaap combined ratios of  and for the calendar years ended december   and  respectively 
as the combined ratio includes reserve strengthening of million  we expect the gaap combined ratio to improve 
with respect to distribution  standard security life is approved to write medical stop loss in all states through ten mgus  and madison national life is licensed to write this line in states through two mgus 
t he company has a significant ownership interest in five of these mgus including those owned by amic  which produced million of medical stop loss premium written on ihc paper in the company anticipate s marginal shrinkage in medical stop loss premiums in due to tighter underwriting guidelines and fewer mgus  partially offset by rate increases 
the company anticipates its other historic core lines of business will remain relatively constant in expansion of fully insured health segment through the acquisitions of hpa and grouplink in and iac in  ihc has expanded into multiple new fully insured health product s  including short term medical st m  group major medical and major medical for individuals and families including consumer driven health plans cdhps  dental  vision  limited medical and student medical the fully insured health products 
these products are now approved in the majority of states  although we will only selectively write our fully insured health products in the n ortheastern  and certain other  states 
collectively  ihc will administer  manage and distribute its fully insured health products through its access to approximately  general agents  agents and brokers producers in the majority of states 
ihc believes this is one of the largest networks of producers focusing on the sale of fully insured health products in the country 
in addition  the company now owns two companies cais and ihc health solutions that are market ing its major medical for groups  individuals and families including cdhps  stm and dental products through alternative distribution methods in addition to general agents 
these companies now produce about of the company s fully insured business 
through the acquisition of actuarial management corp  the company brought in house the actuarial expertise necessary to maintain the profitability of the block  and added another source of fee income and potentially profit commission 
the company believes that  on an annualized basis  by the end of  its fully insured health premiums will exceed those generated by its medical stop loss line 
the f ully i nsured h ealth market is a much larger market than the excess market  estimated at billion compared to a medical stop loss market of approximately billion 
as a result of its multiple product filings  distribution sources  and the sheer size of the market  the company is optimistic that its f ully i nsured health business will continue to grow rapidly while continuing to yield profitable underwriting results  which will help balance the more volatile and cyclical m edical s top l oss business 
expansion of life annuity block acquisitions the company announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a block of life and annuity reserves of approximately million  which is scheduled to close and be effective as of april  we will continue to look for financially viable life and annuity acquisitions during  a lthough the source and timing of new acquisitions is unpredictable 
the company will also begin to leverage its capabilities to administer large blocks of life and annuities for other carriers for whom this is not a core business 
summary in summary  the company anticipates improved operating performance in as a result of i increased premiums and fee income from its multiple f ully i nsured h ealth p roducts through varied distribution channels  ii improved profitability of its medical stop loss business  iii reduced susceptibility to market cycles due to a better balance between excess and fully insured health business  and iv the anticipated acquisition of the aforementioned block of life and annuity business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain an investment portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change change in interest rates fair value in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies were acquired from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substantially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional unrealized gains in its investment portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures
