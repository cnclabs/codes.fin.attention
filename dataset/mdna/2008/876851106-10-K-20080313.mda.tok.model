item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of banking services to our customers  with a primary focus on serving closely held businesses in the chicago metropolitan area and the people who own and manage them 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the net loss in included a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share  for the write off of our goodwill 
excluding this one time charge  net operating earnings for would have been million  or per diluted share 
this non gaap measure of net operating earnings is discussed more fully below 
the largest component of the decline in net operating earnings in was a million provision for loan losses in  compared with a provision of million in in addition  lower net interest margin caused a million  or  decline in net interest income during net income in included million  or per share  of tax benefits associated with the resolution of particular tax uncertainties 
these tax benefits were recognized in the second half of because of the expiration of the statute of limitations on our income tax return and the completion of certain taxing authority examinations 
total assets at december  were billion  compared to billion at december   an increase of million  or 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted common share  compared with million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the increased net income in was primarily a result of the million  or per share  of tax benefits associated with the resolution of particular tax uncertainties 
excluding this tax benefit  net operating earnings for would have been million  or per diluted common share 
this non gaap measure is discussed more fully below 
pre tax income decreased million  or  during to million  compared to million during the decrease in pre tax income was largely due to an increase in noninterest expense of million  or  and a decrease in noninterest income of million  or 
these decreases in pre tax income were partly offset by higher net interest income of million  or 
total assets increased by million  or  from year end to billion at december  management uses certain non gaap financial measures and ratios in evaluating our performance 
specifically  for  management reviewed net income and the related earnings per share amount excluding the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of we believe that excluding the non recurring charge to write off our entire goodwill provides a clearer indication of the results of our core businesses for purposes of comparisons to other periods 
the following table reconciles net income and earnings 
table of contents per share as reported under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  to the non gaap pro forma measures 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss  as reported goodwill impairment tax benefit associated with resolution of particular tax uncertainties net operating earnings diluted earnings loss per share  as reported goodwill impairment tax benefit associated with resolution of particular tax uncertainties net operating diluted earnings per share stock repurchase programs during  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under stock repurchase programs at a total cost of million  or an average price of per share 
the decline in total shares outstanding  which were  at december   compared with  at december   was primarily a result of these programs 
at december   our stock repurchase program would permit us to repurchase an additional million of our common stock through august  while we have continued authorization  we have not repurchased any of our common shares since november application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
our accounting policies are described in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on 
table of contents several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and an unallocated allowance 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding not only our borrowers probability of default  but also the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the current illiquidity in the real estate market has increased the uncertainty with respect to real estate values 
because of the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and therefore have higher potential losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans can cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
goodwill impairment we had million of goodwill that was created from our acquisition of the bank 
we test this goodwill for impairment on july of each year  or between annual assessment dates whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
because of adverse changes in the business climate that impacted the bank during the fourth quarter of  we performed an additional goodwill impairment test as of december  as a result of a decline in the market price of our common stock to levels significantly below our book value  we determined that the entire amount of our goodwill was impaired  and we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge to write off the remaining balance in the fourth quarter of income taxes at times  we apply different tax treatment for selected transactions for tax return purposes than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
the different positions result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations  and interpretations  and our accruals for income taxes include reserves for these differences in position 
our estimate of the value of these reserves contains assumptions based upon our past experience and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  and we believe that the level of these reserves is reasonable 
we initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examinations 
subsequently  the reserves are then utilized or reversed when we determine the more likely than not threshold is no longer met  once the statute of limitations has expired  or the tax matter is effectively settled 
however  because reserve balances are estimates that are subject to uncertainties  the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amounts we have accrued 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange and floor and collar agreements  to assist in our interest rate risk management 
we also may use derivatives to accommodate individual customer needs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas or are not designated as an accounting hedge are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of the hedge and quarterly thereafter  a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivative flow through the consolidated statements of operations in other noninterest income  which results in greater volatility in our earnings 
the estimates of fair values of our derivatives are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate mid market valuations 
the fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and therefore can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in volatility in our statement of operations 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets  including investment securities  loans and hedged derivative instruments  and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  million  or  less than tax equivalent net interest income of million during these non gaap tax equivalent measures are discussed more fully below 
the decrease in net interest income was a result of a decline in our net interest margin 
our tax equivalent net interest margin was during  basis points lower than the net interest margin of during the decline in the net interest margin resulted from our funding cost outpacing the increase in our total earning asset yield 
while investment yields during benefited from increases in term 
table of contents market interest rates that occurred during  competitive pricing pressure for loans and the impact of higher nonaccrual loans resulted in a decline in the yield on total loans 
our funding costs increased as a result of changes in funding mix and the repricing of term deposits to higher interest rates 
our tax equivalent net interest spread  which is determined by subtracting the yield on interest earning assets from the cost of interest bearing liabilities  declined basis points during to  compared to in during  our yield on our interest earning assets increased basis points to from during however  over the same time period  the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion during higher average loans accounted for most of the increase in average earning assets during average loans were billion in  an increase of million  or  as compared to average loans of billion in average commercial loans increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion during decreases in consumer related loans of million  or  partly offset this increase 
the growth in average earning assets during was largely funded with wholesale funding sources 
average fhlb borrowings were million during as compared to million during  and average interest bearing deposits balances were billion during  compared to billion during increases in interest bearing demand deposits  primarily higher rate money market accounts  were offset by decreases in average time deposit and savings account balances 
see deposits below for further discussion of the changes in our deposit balances during actions by the federal reserve resulted in a basis point decline in the prime interest rate in january we believe  based on our internal modeling  that our net interest margin will likely decline over the next six months because during a falling interest rate environment  our portfolio of prime based loans is expected to reprice faster than our term deposits 
additional factors  including those described above that negatively impacted our net interest margin  may put further pressure on our net interest margin in see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks below for further discussion of the impact of changes in interest rates 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million during these non gaap tax equivalent measures are discussed more fully below 
the net interest income increased as a result of higher average interest earning assets  partly offset by a decline in our net interest margin 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was during  compared to during  a decrease of basis points 
the margin in was negatively impacted by competitive pricing pressure for loans and deposits  as well as changes in our earning asset and funding mix in as compared to the tax equivalent net interest spread declined basis points during to  compared to in while our yield on our interest earning assets increased basis points to during from during  the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased to a greater extent 
the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion for  compared to billion for average loans increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion for average commercial loans accounted for most of the increase  as these balances increased million  or  between the two periods 
our portfolio of home equity and consumer loans 
table of contents decreased by million  or 
the yield earned on our loan portfolios benefited from the rising interest rate environment and the increase in the prime lending rate from june to june however  we experienced a decline in the interest rate spread above the prime lending rate on our prime based loans due to competitive pressures within our marketplace 
in addition  our investment portfolio  the yield on which is generally lower than the yield on our loans  was higher in average investment balances increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the growth in average earning assets during was funded primarily with interest bearing deposits 
average interest bearing deposits balances were billion during  a million  or  increase from average interest bearing deposit balances of billion in during  average money market balances increased million  or  and average brokered certificates of deposits cds increased million  or 
while these balances increased  the balances of our lower cost deposits  such as now accounts  savings accounts  and non interest bearing deposits  all decreased 
the shift in balances towards the higher rate deposit products contributed to the downward pressure on our net interest margin during tax equivalent measures 
as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments 
the following table reconciles the tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations

for additional information concerning this determination  see application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses was million during  compared to million during increases in net charge offs  nonperforming loans and the amount of performing loans that have been assessed by us as having higher credit risk  and therefore receiving heighten monitoring  caused us to significantly increase our allowance for loans losses through the provision for loan losses in  particularly in the fourth quarter of net charge offs totaled million  or of average total loans  during compared to million  or of average total loans  in in addition  the level of nonperforming loans increased to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to nonperforming loans of million  or of total loans  at december  see nonperforming assets and impaired loans and allowance for loan losses for further discussion on the credit quality of our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses

this increase was partly offset by a decline in investment management fees and an increase in losses from partnership interests 
noninterest income of million during was million  or  less than noninterest income of million during a decrease in deposit service charges  trust service fees  and loan syndication fees in  as well as the impact of the non recurring gains on the sale of a branch and our land trust operations in  caused the decline in noninterest income in our service charges are principally derived from deposit accounts 
service charges totaled million in each of and and million during service charge income is impacted by a number of factors  including the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the decrease in service charge revenue since was primarily caused by a lower volume of deposit services accounts and an increase in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances to offset gross activity charges 
loan syndication fees totaled million  million  and million  during   and  respectively 
these fees were earned through the syndication of certain commercial real estate development loans for our customers 
loan syndication fees are an opportunistic revenue source that has been largely dependent on the level of activity in the real estate development market as well as our balance sheet and credit risk management 
trust fees were million during both and  approximately less than the million of trust fees in the decline in trust fees over the past two years was a result of our discontinuation of certain trust services during  including the sale of our land trust operations during the first quarter of and the discontinuation of tax deferred exchange trust services during the fourth quarter of trust fees in and were primarily from our offering of corporate trust services 
in connection with the sale of our land trust operations in  we recognized a gain of million 

table of contents investment management fee income decreased  or  to million in  compared to million during in january  we entered into an agreement with mesirow financial  a chicago based asset management firm  pursuant to which mesirow financial provides sub advisory investment management services 
in connection with our entering into this arrangement  several of our former investment management employees terminated their employment with us and joined another financial services company in chicago 
investment management fees in increased  or  as compared to the million of fees in we have investments in limited partnerships that specialize in providing low income housing and community development in the chicago metropolitan area 
we account for our limited partnership investments under the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of partnership losses in noninterest income and the related low income housing tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense 
at december   we had investments in a total of partnerships with a total carrying value of million 
in january  we recorded a million gain in connection with the sale of our broadview  illinois branch 
in addition to selling the land and building  we sold approximately million of deposit balances and million of loans associated with the branch 
other derivative income in of  relates primarily to changes in the fair value of the prime floor which was not designated as an accounting hedge 
included in the  of other derivative income recorded in was  related to the changes in fair value of the prime floor subsequent to the removal of the hedge designation in may the remainder of the other derivative income in related to certain interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  we had used to convert fixed rate brokered cds to a variable rate 
in may  we terminated all of our interest rate swaps related to brokered cds 
through the termination date  we had recognized  of other derivative income from these brokered cd swaps  which reflected the changes in the fair value of both the interest rate swaps and the related hedged brokered cds  as well as the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship 
in  we recognized million of net derivative expense  as other derivative income in included net cash settlements as well as changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
losses in fair value from these swaps of million during were partly offset by net cash settlements received of  an increase in the forward yield curve during caused the decrease in the fair value of the cd swaps

the decrease in other noninterest income during was primarily due to other noninterest income in including  of recoveries of losses on indemnification agreements on residential loans sold in a prior period 
the increase in other noninterest income during as compared to was due primarily to a  increase in the market values of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan and the  of recoveries of losses on indemnification agreements on residential loans sold in a prior period

our noninterest expense in was million  which included a one time charge of million for the impairment of our goodwill 
without the goodwill impairment charge  noninterest expense was million in  which was million  or  less than noninterest expense of million in a decrease in total salaries and employee benefits  partly offset by higher other professional services produced the decrease 
our noninterest expense of million in was million  or  higher than the million of noninterest expense in an increase in advertising and public relations  occupancy of premises  and higher auditing  consulting  and legal fees combined to produce the increase in noninterest expense 
salaries and employee benefits represent the largest category of our noninterest expense 
total salaries and employee benefits expense during was million  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
during  a million decrease in incentive and employee benefit plan expenses produced most of the decrease as compared to total salaries and employee benefits expense in was  or  higher than in  as an increase in salaries  taxes  and medical insurance was largely offset by a decline in incentive compensation 
salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance expense increased  or  to million in  as compared to million in an increase in base salaries  partly offset by lower employment taxes produced the increase in expense 
the increase in base salaries resulted from additions to our team of commercial banking relationship managers made in mid and related support staff  partly offset by the departure of our investment management employees in january salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance expense increased million  or  in  as compared to the million of expense in the increase in base salaries during was primarily caused by our increased investment in our commercial 
table of contents banking relationship managers 
severance expense was  in   in  and  in the number of full time equivalent employees was at december  compared to and at the end of and  respectively 
total incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in cash based incentives and retirement plan expenses reflects the diminished financial performance during total incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in similar to  we reduced our accruals for cash based incentives for because certain performance targets were not achieved 
this decrease was partly offset by a million increase in cost of equity based compensation  primarily due to the adoption of new accounting requirements in that require the recognition of expense related to stock options granted to employees and directors 
compensation costs in and included  and  respectively  of costs related to stock options 
beginning in  salaries and employee benefits expense was impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which revised and reissued guidance on the accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r eliminated the intrinsic value method that we previously used to account for the granting of employee stock options 
we adopted sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective method  recording compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remained outstanding at the date of adoption 
stock based compensation expense  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized against earnings for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated using a black scholes pricing model 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in to write off our remaining goodwill balance 
our goodwill was created from our acquisition of the bank 
we test goodwill for impairment on july of each year  or between annual assessment dates whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
because of adverse changes in the business climate that impacted the bank during the fourth quarter of  we performed an additional goodwill impairment test as of december  as a result of a decline in the market price of our common stock to levels significantly below our book value  we determined that the entire amount of our goodwill was impaired and recorded the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of our occupancy of premises expense was million during  compared to million during  an increase of  or 
an increase in expense associated with our leased facilities and higher real estate taxes primarily produced the higher level of expense 
during  we moved our downtown chicago facility from one leased facility to another as the lease on the existing facility was set to expire in december as a result  we incurred lease expense for the new facility and the existing facility as we transitioned to the new space 
in addition  we incurred costs to physically move to the new facility 
also  costs associated with the closing of our orland park banking center and portions of our leased administrative offices at our burbank facility contributed to the increase in occupancy costs 
occupancy costs were million during  as compared to million during occupancy of premises expense increased  or  during  as compared to  primarily due to higher building related expenses including depreciation  real estate taxes  and maintenance 
furniture and equipment expense was million during  compared to million and million during of and  respectively 
lower depreciation and maintenance produced the decrease in the yearly comparisons 
total legal fees  net of reimbursements  were million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
legal fees consist of both holding company and bank expenses 
holding company legal fees consist primarily of costs for general corporate matters  including securities law 
table of contents compliance and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
bank legal fees relate to collection activities  loan documentation  contract and compliance matters and are reported net of reimbursements received from customers 
while holding company legal fees declined by  bank legal fees increased  primarily driven by increased collection activities  the reorganization of our wealth management business and other contract matters 
other professional fees were million during  compared to million in both of and other professional services expense in increased compared to and  primarily due to the sub advisory investment management services now provided by a third party asset management firm 
our advertising expenses were million in each of and  compared to  in we increased advertising expense in and to increase awareness and launch a new brand marketing campaign 
our computer processing expense is comprised of payments to third party processors  primarily for our key data processing applications including loans  deposits  general ledger  payroll  internet banking and atm operations 
our computer processing expense was million during compared to million during each of and corporate insurance totaled million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
a reduction in the amount of our directors and officers insurance coverage and a more favorable insurance market  among other factors  caused the decrease in expense since nonperforming asset expense was  in  compared to  in and  in this net expense is influenced to a large degree by the number and complexity of the lending relationships being managed in our work out area and properties being maintained pending their sale 
an increase in nonperforming assets and loans in our work out area caused the increase in we expect that a relatively higher level of nonperforming assets at december  may result in an increase in this expense during consulting expense was  million  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the higher expense during as compared to and primarily resulted from higher human resource related services 
fdic insurance premiums were   and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the bank is an illinois chartered bank whose deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance fund 
the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments based upon a risk classification system 
during the past three years  the bank s assessment consisted only of assessments to cover the interest payments on outstanding obligations of the financing corporation fico  which was created in to finance the recapitalization of the savings and loan deposit insurance fund 
the fico assessments were in addition to the deposit insurance assessment 
during and  the bank had qualified for the rate on deposit insurance 
beginning in  the fdic increased the rates paid for deposit insurance 
however  at the same time  the fdic allowed eligible insured institutions to share in an one time assessment credit for institutions in existence at december  that had paid deposit insurance assessments prior to that date 
the bank received a one time credit and utilized this credit in to offset its increased deposit insurance assessment 
the bank expects that this one time credit will be fully utilized during the first quarter of as a result  the bank will begin to incur expense for deposit insurance premiums in addition to its share of the fico obligations 
we expect that deposit insurance premiums for the bank in will be approximately million higher than in other noninterest expense principally includes certain professional fees  operating losses and other operating expenses such as telephone  postage  office supplies  and printing

income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended december   notwithstanding the pre tax loss of million  primarily because the goodwill impairment charge of million was not deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate was lower because of the lower level of pre tax earnings and the impact on the effective income tax rate of our tax exempt interest income was larger than in previous periods

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services

table of contents we use our investment portfolio primarily for liquidity and interest rate risk management 
in august  we began the execution of an investment securities strategy designed to reduce the impact to our net interest income from declining interest rates 
over the latter half of  we purchased million of investment securities  primarily in the form of government sponsored enterprise issued mortgage backed securities 
these purchases  partly offset by maturities and repayments of mortgage related securities  caused our investment portfolio during to increase by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the overall weighted average life of our investment portfolio at december  was approximately years  compared to approximately years at december  in connection with our liquidity risk management  we regularly assess the size of our investment portfolio to meet our liquidity needs 
see liquidity and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks below for further discussion of our liquidity and interest rate risk management 
our investment portfolio increased by million  or  to million at december   compared to million at year end in  we purchased million of mortgage related securities and million of tax exempt municipal securities 
these purchases were partly offset by principal repayments and maturities 
at december   we had a net unrealized gain on the available for sale securities of million  or of amortized cost  compared to a net unrealized loss on the available for sale securities was million  or of amortized cost  at december  we had previously reported in our fourth quarter earnings release  dated january   a net unrealized loss on available for sale securities of million  or of amortized cost  at december  following the issuance of that release  however  we increased the total fair value of our investment portfolio on our year end consolidated balance sheet by million  or of amortized cost  from the previously reported amount of million 
this increase resulted in a net million increase in total assets and accumulated other comprehensive income within total stockholders equity  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the increase in the total fair value of our investment portfolio reflects an adjustment to the market value of our portfolio to update the values to december  these revisions had no impact on our previously reported operating results 
at december   we had investment securities in a gross unrealized loss position of million 
of these securities  securities have been in a loss position for months or more 
we believe that the unrealized losses arose from increased market interest rates  not credit deterioration  and that no other than temporary impairments exist 
none of our mortgage related securities are collateralized by sub prime mortgages and all of our mortgage related securities were rated at least investment grade at december  we believe that none of these unrealized losses represented other than temporary impairments of our investment portfolio 
we have both the intent and ability to hold all of these securities for the time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
we manage our potential exposure to impairment within our investment securities portfolio by limiting potential credit risk and the purchase of securities at a premium over par value and by subjecting all securities to interest rate shock testing prior to their acquisition 
no security is purchased if the result of the interest rate shock testing indicates a negative yield could result under any of the rate shocks 
in addition  we adjust premium amortization monthly based on current prepayment estimates and month rolling actual prepayment rates for all mortgage related securities 
investments in us government and government sponsored agency securities are generally considered to have low credit risk 
our mortgage backed securities holdings consist principally of direct pass through securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac 
while these securities are considered to have low credit risk  they do possess market value risk due to the prepayment risk associated with mortgage backed securities 
our collateralized mortgage obligations cmos consist primarily of planned amortization class securities that are backed by fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
although the majority of our cmos are guaranteed as to principal and interest by certain agencies  primarily fannie mae and freddie mac  they possess market risk due to the prepayment risk associated with the underlying collateral

however  certain municipal issues  which are restricted to our local market area  are not rated and undergo the bank s standard underwriting procedures for loan transactions 
we also have investments in federal reserve bank stock and fhlb stock which are required to be maintained for various purposes 
on october   the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc filed a form k in which it reported that the fhlbc had entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator 
under the terms of the order  capital stock repurchases  redemptions of fhlbc stock and dividend declarations are subject to prior written approval from fhlbc s regulator 
subsequently  the fhlbc announced that it would not declare a dividend for the third or fourth quarters of at december   we held  at cost  million of fhlbc stock  all of which we believe we will ultimately be able to recover 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities  that exceeded of stockholders equity 
although we hold securities issued by municipalities within the state of illinois that  in the aggregate  exceed of stockholders equity  none of the holdings from any individual municipal issue exceed this threshold 
investment securities with an approximate book value of million and million at december  and  respectively  were pledged to collateralize certain deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb advances  and for other purposes as required or permitted by law

at december   we had approximately million of real estate construction loans secured by collateral in ten other states  with no state comprising more than of the total real estate construction portfolio 
over the past two years  the strongest loan growth in the commercial portfolio was in c i loans  which continues to be a key element in our lending strategy 
the slowing real estate market is expected to continue to impact the growth in our real estate construction portfolio 
our portfolio of residential real estate mortgages continues to modestly decline as a result of our decision to de emphasize this product in at december   this portfolio totaled million  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively

in addition  an objective loan review process independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the reasonableness of the lending officer s loan risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the responsible lending officer reports to a loan committee about the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level

nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
all loans past due days or more are evaluated to determine if the accrual of interest should be discontinued 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis for recognition of interest income when sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest 
generally  loans are to be placed on nonaccrual when principal and interest is contractually past due days  unless the loan committee determines that the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection

nonperforming real estate construction loans comprised approximately of total nonaccrual loans at december  the increase consisted primarily of loans to three residential real estate developers with loans totaling million  million and million at december  we believe the decline in residential home sales in the chicagoland market that began in persisted throughout this downturn in the residential housing market has reduced demand and market prices for developed residential lots and vacant land as well as homes 
where there is reduced demand for new homes  certain residential developers may be required to hold their properties for longer periods of time or sell their 
table of contents properties at reduced prices  which can lead to greater holding costs and lower or deferred cash inflows 
these factors may result in higher credit risk for the lender 
in addition  we believe the recent turmoil in the sub prime lending market has caused tightened credit standards throughout the mortgage industry and has taken some potential home buyers out of the market 
we viewed the increase in our nonperforming loans as an indicator of increased credit risk in our loan portfolio and incorporated those trends into our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
a continued downturn in the residential real estate market in could result in additional defaults by our real estate developers 
the inability of a borrower to comply with the contractual terms of the loan agreement and become past due requires the loan be reported as nonperforming 
however  not all nonperforming loans are considered impaired loans 
a loan may be contractually past due with respect to the note maturity date but current on interest or otherwise performing such that we believe the loan is probable of payment of interest and principal in full 
a loan is considered impaired if  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we regard all nonaccrual loans as impaired  as well as those accruing loans that we believe to have higher risk of noncompliance with the contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal 
once we determine that a loan has been impaired  we then determine what we believe is the likely amount of the impairment 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  our impairment analysis may not always result in an allowance for loan loss for every impaired loan 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  for collateral dependent loans  impairment may be measured using the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
information about impaired loans at or for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands recorded balance of impaired loans  at end of year with related allowance for loan loss with no related allowance for loan loss total allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans  at end of year average balance of impaired loans for the year interest income recognized on impaired loans for the year certain categories of loans that are more homogenous  such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment 
therefore  we do not assign individual credit risk ratings to these loans and they are excluded from impaired loans 
the dollar amount of impaired loans can vary from period to period depending upon the size and number of loans deemed impaired 
total impaired loans were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was million at december  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition to nonperforming and impaired loans  we also actively monitor performing loans where appropriate 
the number and dollar amount of loans to residential real estate developers that  while performing currently are receiving heightened monitoring  increased throughout diminished demand in the residential housing market has revealed specific project or borrower weaknesses that otherwise might have been mitigated by a stronger real estate market 

table of contents allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial  which includes c i  commercial real estate  and real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification and in some cases by delinquency status 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example home equity loans over loan to value  home equity loans equal to or less than  and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  segmenting loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates for prior years for each separate loan segment identified 
each of the prior years historical loss rates is then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the segments  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
our estimate of the amount of loss on a loan secured by real estate has increased in complexity as a result of the current illiquidity in the real estate market 
the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of real estate valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method  can have a material impact on our loss estimates on loans 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

net charge offs were million  or of average loans  during in comparison  net charge offs were million  or of average loans  during and million  or of average loans  during the allowance as a percentage of total loans increased to at december   compared to at december  and at december  the increases in net charge offs  nonperforming loans and the amount of performing loans that have been assessed by us as having higher credit risk  and therefore receiving heightened monitoring  caused us to increase our allowance for loans losses through the provision for loan losses in as compared to the prior years 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and therefore have higher potential losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of 
table of contents commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans and therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans

in addition  we received million from our landlord as tenant allowances for the construction 
the cash received was considered as additional deferred rent and included in accrued interest  taxes and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized as a reduction of lease expense over the year life of the operating lease 
these additions to premises  leasehold improvements  and equipment were offset by annual depreciation and amortization 

table of contents in january  we completed the transition of the banking center that had been on the first floor of the west washington location to a new  square foot facility on south clark street in downtown chicago 
the operating lease on the west washington banking facility also expired at the end of in connection with the move to the new downtown chicago space  we moved the personnel that had been located at the fourth floor of our leased burbank facility to either the new location or our rosemont corporate center 
the lease on the fourth floor of the burbank facility is scheduled to expire in june  and we incurred a charge of  associated with vacating this leased space 
we continue to maintain the operating lease for the banking center on the first floor of the burbank facility that expires in june we also closed our itasca and orland park branches on january  and october   respectively

within this customer group  there were two customers with combined balances of million at december   as compared to million at december  over the course of  a money market customer with million on deposit at december  withdrew its deposits 
increased money market account balances from a variety of other customers largely offset the impact of this withdrawal 
total out of market deposits were million at december   compared to million at december  most of the decrease was due to a million  or  decrease in brokered cds

we utilize out of market cds to fund the portion of our earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
while these time deposits generally carry higher interest rates  prudent use of these alternatives is part of our strategy for the management of our overall cost of funding 
when we evaluate the rate paid on a particular in market deposit product  we quantify the cost of the increase and weigh it against the alternative of maintaining the rate and exposing ourselves to potential balance runoff  which then must be funded through alternative sources 
this in market deposit pricing strategy has been critical for us in the management of our cost of total funding 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a 
table of contents private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts of  or less as the purchasers seek to maintain full fdic deposit insurance protection 
the balance of cds obtained through this marketing medium was million at december   as compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
we also issue brokered cds 
the balance of our brokered cds was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
under fdic regulations  only well capitalized institutions may fund brokered cds without prior regulatory approval  and the bank is currently categorized as well capitalized 
adverse operating results at the bank or changes in industry conditions or overall market liquidity could lead to our inability to replace brokered deposits at maturity  which could result in higher costs to  or reduced asset levels at  the bank 
total brokered money market balances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
brokered cds are carried net of the related broker placement fees and the remaining unamortized fair value adjustments that resulted from the termination of interest rate exchange agreements that were associated with brokered cds previously accounted for as fair value hedges 
the broker placement fees and unamortized fair value adjustment are amortized to the maturity date of the related brokered cds 
the amortization is included in deposit interest expense 
brokered cds callable by us totaled million at december  we regularly review the interest rates paid on these callable cds and exercise our call option if lower rates are currently available in the market place 
upon calling the cd  the unamortized broker placement fees and fair value adjustments are recognized currently in earnings 
at december   the scheduled maturities of brokered cds were as follows year total in thousands thereafter subtotal unamortized broker placement fees unamortized fair value adjustment total time deposits  including public funds  in denominations of  or more totaled million at december  the following table sets forth the amount and maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  december  in thousands months or less between months and months between months and months over months total during the first quarter of  we agreed to sell one of our branches located in the city of chicago to another financial institution 
the branch s deposits total approximately million  while its loans total approximately million 
the transaction will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents total period end deposit balances increased million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  while total in market deposits remained relatively unchanged at billion at both december  and  total out of market deposits increased million  or  in to million at december  from million at december  the increase in out of market deposits resulted from an increase in brokered money market accounts of million and brokered cds of million 
other borrowings at december   our other borrowings totaled million as compared to million at december  average other borrowings for and were million and million  respectively 
our other borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and us treasury tax and loan note option accounts 
the federal funds purchased are primarily noncollateralized funds obtained from financial institutions where the bank acts as one of the selling institution s primary correspondent banks 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase include overnight and term agreements 
the overnight securities sold under agreement to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers 
overnight agreements were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate of the overnight repurchase agreements was and at december  and  respectively 
we also had term repurchase agreements of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate of the term repurchase agreements was and at december  and  respectively 
during  we used million of term repurchase agreements to help fund the purchase of investment securities 
these borrowings included million of structured repurchase agreements  with embedded interest rate caps  and a five year term with a two year no call provision  million of repurchase agreements with a three year term and a three month no call provision  and million of repurchase agreements with a five year term and a three month no call provision 
granting the call option to the counterparty reduced the cost of the term funding  while the embedded interest rate caps reduced potential exposure to increases in market interest rates on the floating rate portion of the funding 
at december   subject to available collateral and in addition to the amounts already outstanding  the bank had available pre approved overnight federal funds borrowings and repurchase agreement lines of million and million  respectively 
at december   we had a million term repurchase agreement that we executed with a broker dealer to fund a portion of our investment security purchases during this term repurchase agreement matured in september for additional details of the other borrowings  see the section captioned notes to consolidated financial statements other borrowings from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report

the facility matures on november  and is secured by the pledge of our capital stock of the bank 
the underlying loan agreement requires that the bank remain well capitalized and the holding company remain adequately capitalized as defined by regulatory guidelines 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
fhlb advances 
our fhlb advances consist of borrowings from the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc 
at december  totaled fhlb advances were million  compared to million at december  the weighted average interest rate was and at december  and  respectively 
during  the bank increased its borrowing from the fhlb to help fund the purchase of investment securities 
the fhlb advances are collateralized by investment securities and a blanket lien on qualified first mortgage residential and home equity loans 
for additional details of the fhlb advances  see the section captioned notes to consolidated financial statements notes payable and fhlb advances from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
on october   the fhlbc filed a form k in which it reported that the fhlbc had entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator 
under the terms of the order  capital stock repurchases  redemptions of fhlbc stock and dividend declarations are subject to prior written approval from fhlbc s regulator 
the fhlbc subsequently announced that it would not declare a dividend for the third quarter or the fourth quarter of at december   we held  at cost  million of fhlbc stock  all of which we believe we will ultimately be able to recover 
based on written correspondence and verbal communications with the fhlbc  we believe the order should not impact the fhlbc s ability to provide us with liquidity and funding needs in a manner consistent with past practice 
junior subordinated debentures at december  and  we had million of junior subordinated debentures that were comprised of million issued to tayc capital trust i and million issued to tayc capital trust ii 
each of the trusts is a wholly owned statutory trust

the sole assets of the tayc capital trust i are our junior subordinated debentures 
interest on both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures are payable quarterly at a rate of per year 
we incurred issuance costs of million that is being amortized over the year term of the junior subordinated debentures 
these trust preferred securities have been callable  at our option  since october we continue to review alternatives available to us to refinance or repay the fixed rate trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures 
however  the trust preferred securities market has deteriorated significantly since mid and this source of funding and regulatory capital is largely unavailable at this time 
unamortized issuance costs relating to these debentures were million on december  unamortized issuance costs would be recognized as an expense if the debentures were called by us 
in june  we formed tayc capital trust ii  a wholly owned subsidiary  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate trust preferred securities 
proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred securities  along with million received from the purchase of its common equity securities  were invested by tayc capital trust ii in million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures 
the sole assets of the tayc capital trust ii are our junior subordinated debentures 
the interest rate on both the trust preferred securities and the junior subordinated debentures equals the three month libor plus and re prices quarterly on the th of september  december  march and june

capital resources we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier i capital includes common stockholders equity and trust preferred securities up to certain limits 
goodwill is deducted from tier i capital 
total capital represents tier i capital plus the allowance for loan loss  subject to certain limits  and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier i capital 
at december    and  the holding company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
in  the holding company s regulatory capital ratios decreased 
the decrease was mainly a result of the reduction to regulatory capital caused by the million of the holding company s common stock repurchased under stock repurchase programs during net operating earnings of million for largely offset the impact of higher risk weighted and average assets 
the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of had no impact on regulatory capital as goodwill  by definition  is not included in regulatory capital 
the holding company s regulatory ratios in increased over as the impact of earnings retention was partly offset by an increase in risk weighted and average assets 
at december    and  the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines

we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by extending and laddering the maturity of these liabilities and pledging collateral 
we manage the risk associated with volatility in our customers deposit balances by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
for example  the bank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities or commercial loans as collateral through the borrower in custody program 
under this program  at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral with a lendable value of million 
the bank also maintains pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines at various correspondent banks  which provide additional short term borrowing capacity of million at december  pre approved repurchase agreement availability with major brokers and banks totaled million at december   subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities 
in january  an independent debt rating agency  fitch ratings  downgraded its rating of us and the bank 
fitch reduced the long and short term debt ratings by one rating notch 
specifically  the long term debt rating was revised to bb from bbb and the short term debt rating was revised to b from f  which resulted in the debt ratings moving from investment grade to non investment grade 
fitch s ratings for the bank s deposits however  remained at investment grade at bbb and f for long and short term deposit ratings  respectively 
additionally  fitch revised their ratings outlook to negative from stable 
although the revised deposit ratings remain investment grade  the ratings decline could negatively impact the acquisition or retention of deposits above the fdic insured deposit limits 
the downgrade of our credit rating could increase our cost of borrowing

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts 
historically  approximately of available consumer and commercial loan commitment amounts are drawn 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees

all of the cash flow hedges have been highly effective 
at both december  and  we had designated the floor agreement with a floor interest rate of  as cash flow hedges against interest receipts from prime based loans 
we use the interest rate floor to help manage interest rate risk by protecting interest income in the event that the prime lending rate declines below the floor level

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  or alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps and interest rate floors and collars  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts can be designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to be million  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was million  or higher than the rates unchanged scenario 
net interest income at risk for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was million  or  lower than the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines of 
actions by the federal reserve resulted in a basis point decline in the prime interest rate in january we believe  based on our simulation modeling of the impact of a falling rate environment  that our net interest margin would likely decline over the next six months as our portfolio of prime based loans is expected to 
table of contents reprice faster than our term deposits 
additional critical factors affecting our net interest margin that are not specifically measured as part of interest rate risk are the impact of competition on loan and deposit pricing as well as changes in our balance sheet such as the mix of our assets or funding 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and change in interest rates change in future net interest income at december  at december  dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year we also model changes in the shape steepness of the yield curve  other parallel shifts in the yield  such as a basis point increase in interest rates  and balance sheet growth scenarios 
we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing under the different interest rate scenarios 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience 
volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb federal reserve bank stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings notes payable fhlb advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon
