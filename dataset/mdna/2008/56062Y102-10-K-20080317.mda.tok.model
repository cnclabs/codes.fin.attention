results of operations net income was  in   in  and  in earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis were in  in  and in the decrease from to in overall net income and earnings per share was primarily attributable to three factors the decrease in the company s net interest margin  the increase in the company s loan loss provision expense  and the expenses incurred for the data processing system conversions of the hobart and crawfordsville affiliates 
key measures of the operating performance of the company are return on average assets  return on average shareholders equity  and efficiency ratio

tax equivalent net interest income of  in increased from  in net interest margin  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  was for compared to for the same period a year ago 
due to the relatively flat nature of the yield curve for most of  the company s cost of funds increased steadily throughout the year and outpaced the increase in the yield on earning assets 
partially offsetting this trend was a favorable shift in the company s volume and mix of earning assets as lower yielding residential real estate loans were replaced by higher yielding commercial loans

balance sheet at december   total assets were  compared to  at december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the organic growth in the company s loan portfolio  which grew by million 
loans  credit risk and the allowance and provision for loan losses loans remain the company s largest concentration of assets and continue to represent the greatest potential risk 
the loan underwriting standards observed by the company s subsidiaries are viewed by management as a means of controlling problem loans and the resulting charge offs 
the company s conservative loan underwriting standards have historically resulted in higher loan quality and generally lower levels of net charge offs than peer group averages 
the company also believes credit risks may be elevated if undue concentrations of loans in specific industry segments and to out of area borrowers are incurred 
accordingly  the company s board of directors regularly monitors such concentrations to determine compliance with its loan concentration policy 
the company believes it has no undue concentrations of loans 
total loans excluding those held for sale increased by million from year end the increase in commercial loans including commercial real estate and construction and development loans was the primary driver of this increase 
in total  commercial loans grew by million  or approximately

loans are placed on non accrual status when  in management s judgment  the collateral value and or the borrower s financial condition does not justify accruing interest 
as a general rule  commercial and real estate loans are reclassified to nonaccrual status at or before becoming days past due 
interest previously recorded is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent interest payments collected on nonaccrual loans are thereafter applied as a reduction of the loan s principal balance

during  the acquired entities loans were subject to the company s loan review process and fully integrated into the company s allowance for loan losses allocation methodology 
as a result of this process  the allowance dollars were allocated to the appropriate loan categories and the unallocated portion decreased 
management maintains a list of loans warranting either the assignment of a specific reserve amount or other special administrative attention 
this watch list  together with a listing of all classified loans  nonaccrual loans and delinquent loans  is reviewed monthly by the board of directors of each banking subsidiary 
additionally  the company evaluates its consumer and residential real estate loan pools for probable losses incurred based on historical trends  adjusted by current delinquency and non performing loan levels 
the ability to absorb loan losses promptly when problems are identified is invaluable to a banking organization 
most often  losses incurred as a result of prompt  aggressive collection actions are much lower than losses incurred after prolonged legal proceedings 
accordingly  the company observes the practice of quickly initiating stringent collection efforts in the early stages of loan delinquency 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in each subsidiary is reviewed at least quarterly 
the determination of the provision amount in any period is based upon management s continuing review and evaluation of loan loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  classified loans including non accrual and impaired loans  current economic conditions  the amount of loans presently outstanding  and the amount and composition of loan growth

at the time of acquisition  these loans had evidence of credit deterioration 
in applying this accounting standard  an allowance for loan losses amount was not carried over or established for these loans 
instead these loans are carried at their fair value at date of acquisition including consideration of expected cash flows to be received 
the valuation allowance for these purchased loans as of december  was  before the adoption of sop  this valuation allowance would have been included in the allowance for loan losses balance 
had this amount been included in the allowance for loan losses amount at december   the allowance would have been  or of total loans 
securities securities offer flexibility in the company s management of interest rate risk  and are the primary means by which the company provides liquidity and responds to changing maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the company s investment policy prohibits trading activities and does not allow investment in high risk derivative products or junk bonds 
as of december   all of the securities are classified as available for sale afs and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity

the average life of the company s investment securities portfolio was years at december  with a flat to inverted yield curve for a majority of the year  investment activity was focused on sustaining the strategic positioning of the portfolio 
the portfolio concentrations were maintained in mortgage related securities as well as tax exempt securities with a focus on discounted product 
entering the portfolio continues to remain positioned for long term performance with an emphasis on stable cash flows 
sources of funds the company relies primarily on customer deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase repurchase agreements  along with shareholders equity to fund earning assets 
federal home loan bank fhlb advances are used to provide additional funding

another source of funding is the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company had fhlb advances of  outstanding at december  these advances have interest rates ranging from to see note to the consolidated financial statements for the maturity schedule of these advances

the company s core capital tier consists of common shareholders equity adjusted for unrealized gains or losses on available for sale afs securities plus limited amounts of trust preferred securities less goodwill and intangible assets 
total capital consists of core capital  certain debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   tier capital to average assets was 
total capital to risk weighted assets was 
both ratios exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies 
risk adjusted capital levels of each of the company s subsidiary banks exceed regulatory definitions of well capitalized institutions 
the trust preferred securities which are classified as subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital or core capital with respect to the company under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
under such guidelines  capital received from the proceeds of the sale of these securities cannot constitute more than of the total tier capital of the company 
consequently  the amount of trust preferred securities in excess of the limitation constitutes tier capital  or supplementary capital  of the company 
as of december   all of the company s trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital 
common shareholders equity is impacted by the company s decision to categorize its securities portfolio as available for sale afs

liquidity liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs  measured in terms of lower yields on short term  more liquid earning assets and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities maturing within one year and money market instruments 
in addition  the company holds approximately million of afs securities maturing after one year  which can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
maintaining a relatively stable funding base  which is achieved by diversifying funding sources  supports liquidity  extends the contractual maturity of liabilities  and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs may arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources  funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans 
the company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits  which provide a sizable source of relatively stable low cost funds 
the company defines core deposits as all deposits except certificates of deposits greater than average core deposits funded approximately of total earning assets during and approximately in management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment

in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
these policies require estimates and assumptions 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
in management s opinion  some of these areas have a more significant impact than others on the company s financial reporting 
these areas currently include accounting for the allowance for loan losses and goodwill 
allowance for loan losses the level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay including the timing of future payments  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets were issued in june of and were effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  if any  will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
the company has selected june as its date for annual impairment testing 
new accounting matters see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of new accounting standards in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the company and its subsidiary banks 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to decrease in the event of a decrease to prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands
