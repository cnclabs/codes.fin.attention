conservation load management conservation and load management expenses are expenses associated with the development  management  and delivery of the company s energy efficiency programs 
energy efficiency programs are designed  in conformity to state regulatory requirements  to help consumers use natural gas and electricity more efficiently and thereby decrease their energy costs 
programs are tailored to residential  small business and large business customer groups and provide educational materials  technical assistance  and rebates that contribute toward the cost of purchasing and installing approved measures 
approximately of these costs are related to electric operations and to gas operations

interest expense  net interest expense is presented in the financial statements net of interest income 
interest expense is mainly comprised of interest on long term debt and short term borrowings 
certain reconciling rate mechanisms used by the company s distribution operating utilities give rise to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities on which interest is calculated see note 
in  total interest expense  net  rose by million compared to this increase principally reflects the issuance of new long term debt by unitil on may  unitil issued and sold million of senior long term notes at a coupon rate of  through a private placement to institutional investors 
the company utilized the proceeds from the long term note financing to refinance existing short term debt and for other corporate purposes of the company s principal utility subsidiaries 
the resulting reduction in average daily short term bank borrowings lowered short term interest expense for the year which partially offset the increase in long term interest expense 
in  total interest expense  net  increased by million compared to interest expense on long term borrowings increased due to the issuance of new fixed rate long term debt 
unitil s new hampshire subsidiary  ues  issued and sold million of series o  first mortgage bonds to institutional investors on september  in december  unitil s massachusetts utility subsidiary  fg e  issued million of unsecured long term notes to institutional investors at an interest rate of 
the proceeds from these long term financings were used principally to finance utility plant additions that had been previously financed on an interim basis with short term bank borrowings 
interest expense on short term debt increased compared to primarily due to higher variable short term interest rates 
these increases in interest expense were partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher carrying charges on regulatory assets 
liquidity  commitments and capital requirements sources of capital unitil requires capital to fund utility plant additions  working capital and other utility expenditures recovered in subsequent and future periods through regulated rates 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from internally generated funds  which consist of cash flows from 
table of contents operating activities  excluding payment of dividends 
the company initially supplements internally generated funds through bank borrowings  as needed  under unsecured short term bank lines 
at december   unitil had an aggregate of million in unsecured revolving lines of credit with three banks 
the company anticipates that it will be able to secure renewal or replacement of some or all of its revolving lines of credit  in accordance with projected requirements 
the company had short term debt outstanding through bank borrowings of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  unitil had approximately million in cash at december  periodically  the company replaces portions of its short term debt with long term financings more closely matched to the long term nature of its utility assets 
the maximum amount of short term borrowings that may be incurred by unitil and its subsidiaries has been subject to periodic approval by the company s regulatory agencies 
at december   unitil had regulatory authorization to incur total short term bank borrowings up to a maximum of million  and ues and fg e had regulatory authorizations to borrow up to a maximum of million and million  respectively 
in  ues and fg e had average short term debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
unitil and its subsidiaries are individually and collectively members of the unitil cash pool 
the cash pool is the financing vehicle for day to day cash borrowing and investing 
the cash pool agreement allows for an efficient exchange of cash among unitil and its subsidiaries 
the interest rates charged to the subsidiaries for borrowing from the cash pool are based on unitil s actual interest costs from its banks under the revolving lines of credit 
at december   all unitil subsidiaries were in compliance with the regulatory requirements to participate in the cash pool 
on may   unitil completed the sale of million of senior long term notes  through a private placement to institutional investors 
the notes have a term of years maturity and a coupon rate of 
the company utilized the proceeds from the long term note financing to refinance existing short term debt and for other corporate purposes of the company s principal utility subsidiaries see note 
on september   ues issued and sold million of series o first mortgage bonds  due september   to institutional investors in the form of a private placement see note 
the proceeds from this long term financing were used to repay short term bank borrowings and permanently finance utility plant additions 
in december  fg e issued and sold million of unsecured long term notes under a debenture note structure see note 
the proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding short term indebtedness of fg e and permanently finance utility plant additions 
the company expects to continue to be able to satisfy its external financing needs by utilizing additional short term bank borrowings and to periodically replace short term debt with long term financings 
the continued availability of these methods of financing  as well as the company s choice of a specific form of security  will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to security market conditions  general economic climate  regulatory approvals  the ability to meet covenant issuance restrictions  if any  the level of the company s earnings  cash flows and financial position  and the competitive pricing offered by financing sources

from year to year  there are likely to be timing differences associated with the cash recovery of such costs  creating under or over recovery situations at any point in time 
rate recovery mechanisms are typically designed to collect the under recovered cash or refund the over collected cash over subsequent month periods 
the company also provides limited guarantees on certain electric supply contracts entered into by the retail distribution utilities 
the company s policy is to limit these guarantees to two years or less 
as of december  there are million of guarantees outstanding and these guarantees extend through march  benefit plan funding in and  the company and its subsidiaries made cash contributions to its pension plan in the amount of million and million  respectively

table of contents regulatory matters overview unitil s retail distribution utilities have the franchise to deliver electricity and or natural gas to all customers in the company s franchise areas  at rates established under traditional cost of service regulation 
under this regulatory structure  ues and fg e recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on a representative test year  in addition to earning a return on their capital investment in utility assets 
as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in massachusetts and new hampshire  all of unitil s customers have the opportunity to purchase their electric or natural gas supplies from third party suppliers 
most small and medium sized customers  however  continue to purchase such supplies through ues and fg e as the providers of basic or default service energy supply 
ues and fg e purchase electricity or natural gas for basic or default service from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual costs of these supplies  without profit or markup  through reconciling  pass through rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted 
in connection with the implementation of retail choice  unitil power and fg e divested their long term power supply contracts through the sale of the entitlements to the electricity sold under those contracts 
ues and fg e recover in their rates all the costs associated with the divestiture of their power supply portfolios and have secured regulatory approval from the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc and massachusetts department of public utilities mdpu  respectively  for the recovery of power supply related stranded costs and other restructuring related regulatory assets 
the remaining balance of these assets  to be recovered principally over the next three to five years  is million as of december  and is included in regulatory assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
unitil s retail distribution companies have a continuing obligation to submit filings in both states that demonstrate their compliance with regulatory mandates and provide for timely recovery of costs in accordance with their approved restructuring plans see note fg e electric division on august   fg e filed an electric distribution rate increase of million  which represents an increase of percent over fg e s total electric operating revenue 
the mdpu has suspended the effective date until march  in order to investigate the propriety of the company s request 
evidentiary hearings were held in november and briefing was completed in january the company anticipates that it will receive a final order from the mdpu with an effective date for new electric rates of march  fg e gas division fg e provides natural gas delivery service to its customers on a firm or interruptible basis under unbundled distribution rates approved by the mdpu 
its current retail distribution rates were approved by the mdpu in fg e s customers may purchase gas supplies from third party vendors or purchase their gas from fg e as the provider of last resort 
fg e collects its gas supply costs through a seasonal reconciling cost of gas adjustment clause and recovers other related costs through a reconciling local distribution adjustment clause 
on january   the mdpu approved a rate settlement agreement settlement between fg e and the attorney general of massachusetts for fg e s gas division 
under the settlement  fg e increased its gas distribution rates by million on february   and an additional million on november  the settlement also included agreement on several other rate matters and service quality performance measures for the company s gas division in the areas of safety  customer service and satisfaction 
fg e other on june   the mdpu opened an inquiry into revenue decoupling  generally defined as a ratemaking mechanism designed to eliminate or reduce the dependence of a utility s distribution revenues on sales 
revenue decoupling is adopted with the intent of removing the disincentive a utility has to administer and promote customer efforts to reduce energy consumption and demand or to install distributed generation to displace electricity delivered by the utility 
the order included a straw 
table of contents proposal for a base revenue adjustment mechanism that severs the link between electric and gas companies revenues and sales  and instead  ties company revenues to the number of customers served 
many interested parties filed comments on the elements of the straw proposal and on revenue decoupling in general 
several parties also provided comments in panel hearings organized by the mdpu 
unitil filed comments generally supporting revenue decoupling and recommended modifications to the mdpu s straw proposal 
this matter remains pending 
ues ues provides electric distribution service to its customers pursuant to rates approved by the nhpuc 
its current retail electric distribution rates were approved by the nhpuc in under a settlement agreement with the nhpuc 
on june   the nhpuc issued an order in its investigation into implementation of the federal energy policy act of regarding the adoption of standards for time based metering and interconnection 
this order set the framework for implementation of time based rates for utility provided default service 
on august   the nhpuc issued an order on motion for rehearing  staying the june  order pending hearing and reconsideration of the issues 
an order following hearing was issued on january  finding that it is appropriate to implement time based metering standards and ordering that the details  including cost benefit analyses  form of rate design  time of implementation and applicable customer classes shall be determined in separate proceedings to be initiated by the commission 
on may   the nhpuc issued an order opening an investigation into the merits of instituting appropriate rate mechanisms  such as revenue decoupling  which would have the effect of removing obstacles to  and encouraging investment in  energy efficiency 
several parties attended the prehearing conference on june  and subsequent technical sessions 
on july   the gas and electric utilities made baseline presentations designed to assist the parties in understanding current regulatory methods and the utilities assessment of existing incentives and barriers to energy efficiency investment 
on november   the commission hosted expert presentations about the potential of various regulatory approaches to promote energy efficiency 
the proceeding remains open 
environmental matters the company s past and present operations include activities that are generally subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations 
the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations  and the company believes that as of december   there are no material losses reasonably possible in excess of recorded amounts 
however  there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly stringent federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations could result in increased environmental compliance costs 
sawyer passway mgp site fg e continues to work with environmental regulatory agencies to identify and assess environmental issues at the former manufactured gas plant mgp site at sawyer passway  located in fitchburg  massachusetts 
fg e has proceeded with site remediation work as specified on the tier b permit issued by the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep  which allows fg e to work towards temporary closure of the site 
a status of temporary closure requires fg e to monitor the site until a feasible permanent remediation alternative can be developed and completed 
fg e recovers the environmental response costs incurred at this former mgp site not recovered by insurance or other means in gas rates pursuant to terms of a cost recovery agreement approved by the mdpu 
pursuant to this agreement  fg e is authorized to amortize and recover environmental response costs from gas customers over succeeding seven year periods  without carrying costs 
in addition fg e has filed suit against several of its former insurance carriers seeking coverage for past and future environmental 
table of contents response costs at the site 
any recovery that fg e receives from insurance or third parties with respect to environmental response costs  net of the unrecovered costs associated therewith  are split equally between fg e and its gas customers 
fg e is in the process of developing long range plans for a feasible permanent remediation solution for the sawyer passway site  including alternatives for re use of the site 
included on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and in environmental obligations is million related to estimated future clean up costs for permanent remediation of the site 
a corresponding regulatory asset was recorded to reflect the future rate recovery for these costs 
the amounts recorded do not assume any amounts are recoverable from insurance companies or other third parties 
the company s ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from estimates  which may be adjusted as new information or future developments become available 
based on the company s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities  existing legal requirements and regulatory policies  the company does not believe that these environmental costs will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
employees and employee relations as of december   the company and its subsidiaries had employees 
the company considers it relationships with employees to be good and has not experienced any major labor disruptions 
there are approximately employees represented by labor unions 
these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  which expire may  the agreements provide discreet salary adjustments  established work practices and uniform benefit packages 
the company expects to successfully negotiate new agreements prior to their expiration dates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in making those estimates and assumptions  the company is sometimes required to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements 
if actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates  assumptions and judgment  the financial position of the company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the company could be materially different than reported 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company s principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas by the retail distribution companies ues and fg e 
both ues and fg e are subject to regulation by the ferc and fg e is regulated by the mdpu and ues is regulated by the nhpuc 
accordingly  the company uses the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered or refunded in future electric and gas retail rates 

table of contents sfas no 
specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under sfas no 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under sfas no 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 the company would be required to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of financial accounting standards board statement no 
in the company s opinion  its regulated operations will be subject to sfas no 
for the foreseeable future 
utility revenue recognition regulated utility revenues are based on rates and charges approved by federal and state regulatory commissions 
revenues related to the sale of electric and gas service are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes a provision for doubtful accounts each month 
the amount of the monthly provision is based upon the company s experience in collecting electric and gas utility service accounts receivable in prior years 
account write offs  net of recoveries  are processed monthly 
at the end of each month  an analysis of the delinquent receivables is performed and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed 
the analysis takes into account an assumption about the cash recovery of delinquent receivables and also uses calculations related to customers who have chosen payment plans to resolve their arrears 
the analysis also calculates the amount of written off receivables that are recoverable through regulatory rate reconciling mechanisms 
the company is authorized by regulators to recover the supply related portion of its written off accounts from customers through periodically reconciling rate mechanisms 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment about the assumptions used in the analysis 
also  the company has experienced periods when state regulators have extended the periods during which certain standard credit and collection activities of utility companies are suspended 
in periods when account write offs exceed estimated levels  the company adjusts the provision for doubtful accounts to maintain an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
retirement benefit obligations the company sponsors the following retirement benefit plans to provide certain pension and postretirement benefits for its retirees and current employees the unitil corporation retirement plan pension plan  a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees  the unitil retiree health and welfare benefits plan pbop plan which provides health care and life insurance benefits to retirees  and the unitil corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp  an unfunded retirement plan  with participation limited to executives selected by the board of directors 
the company accounts for its pension and postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas 
table of contents no 
 sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in applying these accounting policies  the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends  and appropriate discount rates 
for each of these plans  the development of the benefit obligation  fair value of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit cost is based on these significant assumptions 
sfas no 
requires companies to record on their balance sheets as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of their retirement benefit obligations rbo based on the projected benefit obligation 
the company has recognized corresponding regulatory assets  to recognize the future collection of these obligations in electric and gas retail rates 
see notes and the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
if these assumptions were changed  the resultant change in benefit obligations  fair values of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit costs could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements see note income taxes provisions for income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax liabilities as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from the timing of the deductions of expenses and recognition of taxable income for tax and book accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for income tax assets  liabilities and expenses in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
and under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fas depreciation depreciation expense is calculated on a group straight line basis based on the useful lives of assets and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets 
the company conducts independent depreciation studies on a periodic basis as part of the regulatory ratemaking process and considers the results presented in these studies in determining the useful lives of the company s fixed assets 
a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
applies to an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material commitments or contingencies other than those disclosed in the significant contractual obligations table in the contractual obligations section above and the commitments and contingencies footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements below 
refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards

risk factors 

table of contents interest rate risk as discussed above  unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long term debt securities 
in addition  short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the average amount of short term debt outstanding of million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on short term borrowings was  and during  and  respectively 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass through basis 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
additionally  as discussed above and below in regulatory matters  the company has divested its commodity related contracts and therefore  further reduced its exposure to commodity risk
