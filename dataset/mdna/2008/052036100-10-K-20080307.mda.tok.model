item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
executive summary we are a growing independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  and development of unconventional natural gas reserves 
our unconventional natural gas projects target shale plays where large acreage blocks can be easily evaluated with a series of low cost test wells 
shale plays tend to be characterized by high drilling success and relatively low drilling costs when compared to conventional exploration and development plays 
our project areas are focused in the antrim shale of michigan and new albany shale of southern indiana and western kentucky 
in  we commenced operations to explore and mine natural resources under the name royal resources  inc in july  we reorganized our business to pursue oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and changed our name to cadence resources corporation 
we acquired aurora energy  ltd 
aurora on october  through the merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into aurora 
the acquisition of aurora was accounted for as a reverse merger  with aurora being the acquiring party for accounting purposes 
the aurora executive management team also assumed management control at the time the merger closed  and we moved our corporate offices to traverse city  michigan 
as a result of the reverse merger  the historical financial statements presented for periods prior to the acquisition date are the financial statements of aurora 
the operations of the former cadence resources corporation businesses have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
effective may   cadence resources corporation amended its articles of incorporation to change the parent company name to aurora oil gas corporation 
operational highlights for the year ended december   we continued to shift our focus from acquisition of properties to an early stage developer of unconventional shale development projects 
as of december   our leasehold acres were   net which represent a increase over our december  net acres 
these leasehold acres are included in the following plays   net leasehold acres in the michigan antrim shale play    net leasehold acres in the indiana antrim shale play    net acres in the new albany shale play    net acres in the woodford shale play  and   net acres in the other play areas 
with regard to our strategy to generate growth through drilling  we drilled or participated in net wells for the year ended december   with a success rate 
as of december   we had net producing wells  net wells awaiting hook up  net wells undergoing resource assessment and net wells temporarily abandoned 
we also continued our strategy to have greater control over our projects by operating net wells  thus  operating of our gross wells and of our net wells 
we began with estimated proved reserves of bcfe and at december  had bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or 
the new albany shale provided the largest increase in proved reserves during the year  adding a net bcfe  which is a increase over the bcfe reported on december  the growth in the new albany shale proved reserves was largely the result of net wells drilled in  which were owned by aurora 
the antrim shale proved reserves were reduced by a net bcfe due to a bcfe increase from positive drilling results in the antrim shale and offset by a bcfe reduction in certain properties 
this reduction reflected a lower production projection to be consistent with actual operating experience 
oil and natural gas production for was  mcfe  or a increase over the  mcfe produced in during  production continued to be hampered by delays in bringing wells into production  weather  dewatering  and certain properties not meeting expected production targets 
our average daily production for was  mcfe per day compared to  mcfe per day in on september   we announced that we have established an acreage position of over  net acres in the woodford shale natural gas play of oklahoma 
the identified target area is focused in central oklahoma  which is experiencing a significant increase in leasing and drilling activity 
it is positioned among geological provinces with active woodford shale development  with average depths over  feet and organic shale thickness up to feet 
we currently have expended approximately million for an working interest in over  gross acres in the play 
the early leasing activities have allowed us to establish this competitive position in the targeted play area 
leasing activities are continuing 
we have targeted for a pilot program of test wells in the project area 
since our current capital expenditure budget has been dedicated to further development of the antrim and new albany shales  we have been in discussions with potential financing sources and joint venture partners to facilitate testing and development of this acreage 
no financing for this development has been procured as of the date of this filing 
in the third quarter of  we drilled six wells in the south knox project area of the new albany shale and began construction of our first operated sales outlet in the new albany shale 
our wholly owned subsidiary  bach services and manufacturing company bach was responsible for building the sales outlet 
bach completed a pipeline which included trenching miles with installation of miles of poly piping and miles of steel piping as well as building a processing and compression facility 
the facility is tapped into the ohio valley hub  llc pipeline system  a wholly owned subsidiary of proliance energy  llc 
we began test flowing gas from these wells on december  other developments on august   we entered into a second lien term loan agreement with bnp  as the arranger and administrative agent  and several other lenders forming a syndication 
the initial term loan is million for a year term which may increase up to million under certain conditions over the life of the loan facility 
the proceeds of the loan were used to pay off our existing mezzanine financing with tcw and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the loan  we also agreed to the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility with bnp and other lenders  pursuant to which the borrowing base under the senior secured credit facility was increased from the current authorized borrowing base of million to million 
in september  we retained johnson rice company  llc jrco to investigate our strategic alternatives 
the alternatives  among other things  were to include revisions to our strategic plan  asset divestitures  operating partnerships  identifying additional capital sources  or a sale  merger  or other business combination 
during this investigative period  we reduced our drilling activities  postponed significant asset divestitures  and focused on maintaining our current operations pending the outcome of the evaluation process 
with the assistance of jrco  our board of directors determined that the best way to create value was to strengthen our management team  increase our capital availability  focus on drilling our undeveloped properties  and optimize our asset portfolio through the sale  joint venture  farm out  or development of our non core leasehold 
on january   we announced the signing of a non binding letter of intent to acquire acadian energy  llc  a private company focused on development of the unconventional resources found in the new albany shale 
the proposed acquisition is valued at approximately million and will include over  acres of new albany shale properties  four development wells  and approximately bcf in proved reserves 
the company is jointly owned and operated by john e 
mcdevitt and gilbert a 
smith and beneficial ownership  respectively 
as part of that announcement  we also noted that  effective january   the board of directors named mr 
mcdevitt president  chief operating officer  and director 
mr 
smith was named vice president of business development  effective as of february  each of these gentlemen offers approximately years of experience  which includes executive level experience  some of it at large exploration and production companies 
in addition  mr 
mcdevitt has spent the bulk of his career specializing in structured finance for emerging enterprises 
with mr 
mcdevitt s assistance  we have determined that our existing capital structure is not adequate to continue our planned growth 
in fact  we believe that the best way to pursue the development of our acreage base is to install project financing directed toward each play or subset of each play 
at this time  we are negotiating several term sheets with certain recognized energy lenders offering credit facilities for a minimum of at least million per project for at least two of our development projects one for the new albany shale and one for the woodford shale 
upon closing  we expect to have to establish separate financing for these projects which will be non recourse to our other businesses 
our goal is to have these term sheets signed within approximately days and closed  subject to bnp consent  within days 
we anticipate announcing the terms of the respective credit facilities upon the closing of such agreements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully procure the project financings that we are seeking 
also  our board of directors is in the process of completing its work with jrco 
this evaluation process did not lead to an asset divestiture  operating partnership  or identification of additional capital sources 
it did  however  lead to a revision in our strategic plan  the related non binding letter of intent to acquire acadian energy  llc  and the change in our management team 
we believe that  despite the operational slowdown we experienced over the past months  this process has enabled the board of directors to retain a more experienced management team  has led to the receipt of term sheets from new financial institutions which are expected to increase our capital availability  and has established a more disciplined focus on optimizing our entire asset base

liquidity and capital resources in september  we retained johnson rice company  llc jrco to assist the board of directors with investigating our strategic alternatives 
these alternatives  among other things  were to include revisions to our strategic plan  asset divestitures  operating partnerships  identifying additional capital sources  or a sale  merger  or other business combination 
during this investigative period  we reduced our drilling activities  postponed asset divestitures  and focused on maintaining current operations pending the outcome of the evaluation process 
based upon the alternatives presented by jrco  our board of directors have determined the best way to create value is as follows i to strengthen our management team  ii adjust our capital structure to improve capital availability  iii focus on drilling our undeveloped properties  and iv optimize our asset portfolio through a combination of asset divestitures  joint venture  or farm out of our non core assets 
currently  we are able to maintain our existing operations through the existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows from sales of oil and natural gas production 
however  we have determined that our existing capital structure is not adequate to fund our planned growth 
we believe the best way to pursue our growth strategy is with project financing for our emerging plays in the new albany shale and the woodford shale 
at this time  we are in the process of negotiating several term sheets with certain recognized energy lenders offering mezzanine project equity financing for at least two areas in our emerging plays 
our goal is to establish separate financing entities for each emerging play while ensuring the financing structure is non recourse to our parent entity 
our current credit facilities are reserve based lending which is appropriate for a mature development play like our antrim shale 
we are currently in discussion to improve our existing credit facilities 
as of the date of this filing  no project financing or amendments to our existing credit facilities have been procured 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring the financing and amendments we are seeking 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production  natural gas prices and successful drilling efforts 
there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures 
on august   we entered into a second lien term loan agreement with bnp  as the arranger and administrative agent  and several other lenders forming a syndicate 
the initial term loan is million for a year term which may increase up to million under certain conditions over the life of the loan facility 
the proceeds of the loan were used to retire the company s existing mezzanine financing with tcw and for general corporate purposes 
interest under the second lien term loan is payable at rates based on the london interbank offered rate plus basis points with a step down of basis points once our ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  and other noncash charges is lower than or equal to a ratio of to on a trailing four quarters basis 
we have the ability to prepay the loan during the first year at a price equal to of par  during the second year at a price equal to of par  and thereafter at a price equal to of par 
the loan contains  among other things  a number of financial and non financial covenants relating to restricted payments as defined  loans or advances to others  additional indebtedness  incurrence of liens  geographic limitations on operations to the united states  and maintenance of certain financial and operating ratios  including i maintenance of a maximum of indebtedness to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization and non cash expenses  and ii maintenance of minimum reserve value to indebtedness 
any event of default under the senior secured credit facility that accelerates the maturity of any indebtedness thereunder is also an event of default under the second lien term loan 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the applicable covenants 
in both the loan and senior secured credit facility  we agreed to an affirmative covenant regarding production exit rates 
the production exit target is mmcfe per day as december  which has been achieved  and as of the last day of each quarter thereafter 
in addition  we were required to purchase financial hedges at prices and aggregate notional volumes satisfactory to bnp  as administrative agent which requirement has been satisfied 
our senior secured credit facility is a million senior secured credit facility with bnp 
in connection with the second lien term loan  we also agreed to the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility with bnp and other lenders  pursuant to which the borrowing base under the senior secured credit facility was increased from the previous authorized borrowing base of million to million 
the amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined by the lenders semi annually on or about april and october of each year or at other times required by the lenders or at our request 
the required semiannual reserve report may result in an increase or decrease in credit availability 
the security for this facility is substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties  guarantees from all material subsidiaries  and a pledge of of the stock or member interest of all material subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit facility provides for borrowings tied to bnp s prime rate or  if higher  the federal funds effective rate plus or libor based rate plus to depending on the borrowing base utilization  as selected by us 
the borrowing base utilization is the percentage of the borrowing base that is drawn under the senior secured credit facility from time to time 
as the borrowing base utilization increases  the libor based interest rates increase under this facility 
as of december   interest on the borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 
the maturity date of the outstanding loan may be accelerated by the lenders upon occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility contains  among other things  a number of financial and non financial covenants relating to restricted payments as defined  loans or advances to others  additional indebtedness  incurrence of liens  geographic limitations on operations to the united states  and maintenance of certain financial and operating ratios  including i maintenance of a minimum current ratio  and ii maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio 
any event of default under the second lien term loan that accelerates the maturity of any indebtedness thereunder is also an event of default under the senior secured credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the applicable covenants 
in both the loan and senior secured credit facility  the company agreed to an affirmative covenant regarding production exit rates 
the production exit target is mmcfe per day as of december  which was achieved  and as of the last day of each quarter thereafter 
in addition  the company was required to purchase financial hedges at prices and aggregate notional volumes satisfactory to bnp  as administrative agent

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using the significant accounting policies  practices and estimates described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the reported financial results are reliable and the ultimate actual results will not differ materially from those reported 
uncertainties associated with the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying our critical accounting measurements are discussed below 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements include the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties and to evaluate the full cost pool in the ceiling test analysis  the estimated fair value of financial derivatives instruments  and the estimated fair value of asset retirement obligations 
oil and gas properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  subject to a limitation based on estimated value  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities of oil and natural gas  including costs of unsuccessful exploration and overhead charges directly related to acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are capitalized 
we are currently participating in oil and natural gas exploration and development projects in the antrim shale of michigan and the new albany shale of southern indiana and western kentucky 
thus  all capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties considered proven  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proven reserves 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of undeveloped or producing oil and natural gas properties unless the sale represents a significant portion of oil and natural gas properties and the gain or loss significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proven reserves 
capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proven reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproven properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment is recognized 
the present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying year end prices of oil and natural gas to estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of year end less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
oil and gas reserves our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geological and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data  as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs  and workover and remedial costs  all of which may  in fact  vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from there may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and natural gas properties 
actual production  revenues  and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
many factors will affect actual net cash flows  including the following the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for natural gas  curtailments or increases in consumption by natural gas purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation

we elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
for stock based awards granted or modified subsequent to january   compensation expense  based on the fair value on the date of grant  will be recognized in the financial statements over the vesting period 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded the following stock based compensation for the years ended december  general and administrative expenses oil and natural gas properties total the impact on future net income is estimated to be  recognized over the applicable requisite service period of approximately years 
income taxes we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards which expire between and significant accounting principles relating to the merger as a result of the reverse merger  we were required to conform certain of cadence s accounting principles to the accounting principles used by aurora prior to the merger 
this was required because aurora was considered to be the accounting acquirer 
our financial statements for the year ended december  were prepared using these accounting principles 
a summary of these accounting principles is as follows aurora is treated as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes  and accordingly  reverse acquisition accounting is applied to the business combination 
we measured the cost of the business acquired in the merger by reference to the fair value of the target s securities ie  shares of cadence common stock  including outstanding options and warrants to purchase such shares at the date of the merger agreement  january  the fair value was determined to be approximately  we uniformly apply the full cost method to all of our oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  the financial statements include a net upward adjustment to the cadence assets in the amount of  to capitalized costs previously expensed by cadence under the successful efforts method 
this increased capitalized costs was used to recalculate depreciation on the new asset base 
in accounting for stock based compensation for the year ended december   we continued to use the intrinsic value method under apb opinion for the year ending december   we will use fas no 
r 
aurora stock options outstanding as of the date of the merger are not accounted for under apb opinion or fas because these options were fully vested at the time of the merger 
their fair value was included in the cost of the business acquired  as discussed above 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  sfas which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
the standard clarifies that  for items that are not actively traded  such as certain kinds of derivatives  fair value should reflect the price in a transaction with a market participant  including an adjustment for risk  not just our mark to model value 
sfas also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
management does not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the fasb issued sfas  fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fasb believes the statement will improve financial reporting by providing companies the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
use of the statement will expand the use of fair value measurements for accounting for financial instruments 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
management does not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combination sfas r and sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas r and sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas r will be applied prospectively 
sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of sfas will be applied prospectively 
early adoption is prohibited for both standards 
management is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and sfas and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by the fluctuations in the market prices of natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we will periodically enter into various derivative instruments with a major financial institution 
the purpose of the derivative instrument is to provide a measure of stability to our cash flow in meeting financial obligations while operating in a volatile natural gas market environment 
the derivative instrument reduces our exposure on the hedged production volumes to decreases in commodity prices and limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any increases in commodity prices on the hedged production volumes 
the following natural gas contracts were in place as of december  period type of contract natural gas volume per day price per mmbtu fair value asset liability april december swap  mmbtu april december collar  mmbtu january december swap  mmbtu january december swap  mmbtu january march swap  mmbtu april september swap  mmbtu total estimated fair value interest rate risk our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposure when appropriate 
in august  we entered into a year interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of million with bnp to hedge our exposure to the floating interest rate on the million second lien term loan 
the swap converted the debt s floating month libor base to fixed base 
this swap on million will yield an effective interest rate of for the period from august  through august   on the second lien term loan 
fair value liability of the interest rate swap agreement at december   amounted to  the following table sets forth our principal financing obligation and the related interest rates as of december  expected maturity average interest rate as of december  principal outstanding obligations under capital lease notes payable mortgage payable fixed at mortgage payable fixed at second lien term loan hedged at senior secured credit facility variable total debt while our senior secured facility exposes us to the risk of rising interest rates  management does not believe that the potential exposure is material to our overall financial position or results of operations 
based on current borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing million additional charge or reduction to our statement of operations
