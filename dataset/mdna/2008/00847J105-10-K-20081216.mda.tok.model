critical accounting policies  estimates assumptions the management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies  litigation and supplier incentives 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company s most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  and promotion of its products 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
no material adjustments to the company s accounting policies were made in specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
the company derives revenue from three primary sources server and storage hardware  software  and services 
revenue is recorded in the period in which the goods are delivered or services are rendered and when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company reduces revenue for discounts  sales incentives  estimated customer returns and other allowances 
discounts are offered based on the volume of products and services purchased by customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold 

table of contents regarding hardware sales  revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are not unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance of the arrangement 
a portion of the company s hardware sales involves shipment directly from its suppliers to the end user customers 
in such transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer and product returns  and bears credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods 
as the principal contact with the customer  the company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold when it is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
in certain limited instances  as shipping terms dictate  revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination 
regarding software sales  the company offers proprietary software as well as remarketed software to its customers 
generally  software sales do not require significant production  modification  or customization at the time of shipment physically or electronically to the customer 
as such  revenue from both proprietary and remarketed software sales is generally recognized when the software has been shipped 
for software delivered electronically  delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software 
regarding sales of services  the company offers proprietary and third party services to its customers 
proprietary services generally are as follows consulting  installation  integration  and maintenance 
revenue relating to consulting  installation  and integration services is recognized when the service is performed 
for certain long term proprietary service contracts  the company follows the percentage of completion method of accounting 
accordingly  income is recognized in the ratio that work performed bears to estimated total work to be performed on the contract 
adjustments to contract price and estimated service hours are made periodically  and losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
the aggregate of billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of related costs is shown as a current asset 
revenue relating to maintenance services is recognized evenly over the coverage period of the underlying agreement 
in addition to proprietary services  the company offers third party service contracts to its customers 
in such instances  the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction and the company bears credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer 
since the company is acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions  the company reports revenue only in the amount of the commission equal to the selling price less the cost of sale received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as historical trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs frequent credit evaluations of its customers 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  net of related reserves 
the cost of inventory is computed using a weighted average method 
the company s inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
the company provides a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
deferred taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets is expensed in the period such determination is made to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including valuation allowance  an adjustment to the tax valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  identified intangibles  and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
the fair value of goodwill and long lived assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 

table of contents restructuring and other special charges 
the company recorded a reserve in connection with reorganizing its ongoing business 
the reserve principally includes estimates related to employee separation costs and the consolidation and impairment of facilities deemed inconsistent with continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
determination of the impairment of assets is discussed above in goodwill and long lived assets 
facility reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a credit adjusted risk free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
valuation of accounts payable 
the company s accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed by vendors for amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by the company and confirmation of the claim by our vendors 
historically  the company s estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by vendors 
supplier programs 
the company receives funds from suppliers for product sales incentives and marketing and training programs  which are generally recorded  net of direct costs  as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses according to the nature of the program 
the product sales incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
the company accrues supplier sales incentives and other supplier incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in accordance with the terms of the related program 
actual supplier sales incentives may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognized approximately million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the april  balance of retained earnings 
as of march  and  the company had a liability of uncertain tax positions  excluding interest  penalty  and federal benefit of million and million respectively 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows dollars in thousands balance at march  additions relating to positions taken during current year due to business acquisitions reductions relating to tax settlements relating to positions taken during prior year due to business acquisitions balance at march  the company recognizes interest accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
penalties are recognized as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
as of march   and  the company had approximately million and million of interest and penalties accrued  respectively

the company anticipates the completion of a state income tax audit in the next twelve months which could reduce the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits by million

in material jurisdictions  the company has potential tax examination years open back to and including which may be subject to tax authority examination
