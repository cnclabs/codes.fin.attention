item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
this discussion generally refers to elements within our consolidated financial statements on a pre tax basis unless otherwise stated 
except for historical information  the discussions in this section contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
for further information regarding risks and uncertainties  see item a 
in this annual report on form k entitled risk factors 
overview we focus our design  manufacturing and marketing efforts on the high performance analog hpa segment of the semiconductor market 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the hpa segment is distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
historically  the hpa segment has yielded higher gross margins and suffers less competition than the digital and broader analog segments of the semiconductor market 
the hpa segment requires uniquely talented and experienced designers  engineers and specialized selling and marketing efforts to address the myriad of challenges associated with today s complex applications 
we began our transformation into an hpa company with the acquisition of elantec in and the divestiture of our wireless networking business in we further strengthened the transformation with the acquisition of xicor 
our transformation has required us to report our financial performance with restructurings  impairments  discontinued operations and write offs attendant to our acquisitions 
our first full year as a pure hpa company was fiscal since then  our focus has resulted in revenue growth that has been very broad based across our many analog products 
we have introduced hundreds of new products in each of the last few years including several new product families that have significantly expanded our served available market 
our investments to expand our product portfolio to over product families appear to be successful  enabling us to reach our primary management goals of revenue growth with higher margins  growing operating income and increasing cash flow generation measured against the investment in the company

table of contents geographical revenue millions revenue of total revenue of total revenue of total asia pacific north america europe and other total revenue and cost of revenue revenue our revenue for was million  an increase of million or over this increase was made up of net growth in our end markets and our acquisition 
our various end markets performed as follows computing products had in revenue growth  followed by high end consumer products at an increase 
however  our industrial products experienced a revenue decline of and our communication products declined 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased revenues by approximately million  which was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices asps  which decreased revenues by approximately million 
of this net revenue growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region  which was offset by revenue declines of million in north america with europe and other countries being approximately even 
higher sales of units resulted from our currently strong product offering in computing and consumer power management devices and consumer electronics 
declining sales prices has been a phenomenon of the semiconductor industry for much of its existence and is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
our revenue for was million  an increase of million or over this increase was driven by growth in all of our four end markets 
communication products saw the highest growth at  followed by computing products at  high end consumer products at and industrial products at 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased sales by approximately million  which was partially offset by a decline in asps  which decreased sales by approximately million 
of this sales growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region  million from north america and approximately million from europe 
we anticipate that our revenue from asia pacific region customers will continue to grow in percentage terms as that region s economy leads in the manufacture of the finished applications consumer electronics  computers  communications equipment that our products are used in 
end market demand for those applications is global and hence dependent on aggregate global economic metrics and conditions such as personal incomes and business activity and not necessarily on asian and pacific rim regional economic factors 
see business outlook elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to expected revenues in the near term 
cost of revenue cost of revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor including stock based compensation  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin declined by basis points in over compared to an increase of basis points in over the basis point decline was largely a function of our sales mix 
generally  our computing products have lower gross margins than other products 
in much of our revenue increase came from power management products in the computing end market 
additionally  in stock based compensation costs 
table of contents charged to cost of sales via direct overhead charges and through inventory relief increased by approximately basis points over the increase in gross margin was partially due to our product mix in  as revenues for our higher margin  general purpose products grew over and sales for some of our lower margin products grew over the increase in gross margins was also a function of lower wafer prices  improved yields and better pricing from our assembly and test partners in operating expenses research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses including stock based compensation of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses increased by to million in compared to million for and million for the increase of approximately million is made up of some million of increased cash compensation and fringe benefits due to higher headcount and pay levels  offset by a million decline in non cash  stock based compensation charges and other net reductions in supplies and facility costs 
our r d expenses increased by in compared to due primarily to increased stock based compensation costs due to our adoption of sfas r in selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses including stock based compensation of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  information systems  legal  executive and other administrative functions 
our sg a expenses decreased by to million for compared to million for and million for the approximately million decrease in compared to was substantially accounted for by a reduction in stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
the remaining costs making up sg a decreased by approximately million  with advertising and outside services declining and personnel costs increasing within that net change 
as with r d stock based compensation costs  the company is managing sg a stock based compensation costs carefully 
our grants had more than a million lower aggregate fair value to amortize over the multi year vesting term than in the increase in compared to was made up of approximately million of additional stock based compensation costs due to our adoption of sfas r in and increased selling and marketing expenses associated with higher sales 
amortization of purchased intangibles  goodwill amortization of purchased intangibles for was million  in and the amortization amounts were approximately equal at million 
the increase in compared to resulted from the additional amortization recorded from two acquisitions made in september for which amortization was included in the fourth quarter of our purchased intangibles  which are definite lived assets  are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we review goodwill for impairment indicators quarterly and perform substantive impairment testing annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the value of our reporting units exceeded the goodwill value stated on our balance sheet and therefore  we did not record any impairment to goodwill 
however  our goodwill value is dependent on many factors including future market demand for our products  our stock market valuation  valuation of our expected cash flow  relative values of our reporting units and many other factors 
we could have goodwill impairment in the future which would negatively impact our earnings 

table of contents in process research and development ipr d in fiscal  we recorded a charge to earnings for million of purchased in process research and development related to the acquisition of planet ate as described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was the result of the purchase accounting appraisal  for which was management is primarily responsible 
the ipr d was determined using a cost based approach to valuation due to limitations in the market value and income based valuation approaches for this item 
the cost based approach related to approximately two years of historical planet ate research and development expenditures  net of associated tax effects  which relates to the lengthy and risky development life cycle of the typical acquired system ic product for the automated test equipment market 
the company expects to continue to invest in these and other development efforts for this new market and believes there is a reasonable chance of successfully completing the work undertaken at the point of the acquisition 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects  and there is no assurance that any will meet either technological or commercial success 
restructurings in march  we announced a restructuring plan to further streamline operations and to reduce costs 
we recorded million in restructuring expense 
approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated 
the affected positions included manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative employees 
at december   the affected positions had all been terminated 
other gains losses during we recovered million for insured business interruption losses resulting from the hurricanes in during  our florida facilities were damaged by hurricanes resulting in million in reconstruction costs 
a key company objective is to manage operating expenses carefully such that in future periods they increase in both dollars and percent by amounts less than our revenue and thereby continue to utilize operating leverage to increase shareholder value 
other income and expenses interest income our interest income increased to million in compared to million for and million for interest income increased in due primarily to higher balances and rates available in the first half of the year 
in contrast  in the second half of the year  our interest earning balances declined as we conducted our stock repurchase program and funded the acquisition of planet ate 
further  rates began to decline in the second half of the year 
in the fourth quarter of  our interest income declined by over the same quarter of our interest income increased to million  due primarily to increased interest rates earned on our investments compared to with available interest rates currently falling and our interest earning balances expected to be further reduced in due to our increased dividend and continued stock repurchases  we expect that our interest income in will be reduced from our level 
income tax expense our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for compared to tax expense of million or of pretax income for in we enjoyed the benefit of approximately million in discrete tax events  notably the benefit from the loss on the sale of our interest in a 
table of contents cost method investee  absent which the tax expense and tax rate would have been comparable to the amounts reported for our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for compared to tax expense of million or of pretax income for the effective tax rate declined in primarily because of a million dividend repatriation in that did not occur in see below 
the benefit from the loss on the sale of our interest in a cost method investee was the other key driver in the tax rate decline 
our income tax expense for included a provision of million relating to our repatriation of million of foreign earnings 
see note in our consolidated financial statements for more information about our repatriation 
in the first quarter of  the company expects to reverse the non current portion of our income taxes payable to income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations as a benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax years and that benefit to income taxes and earnings is expected to be approximately million and will be apportioned between continuing and discontinued operations 
our expected effective tax rate in the first quarter  absent this event  is 
in determining net income  we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we follow the recently promulgated financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin model to establish reserves for potential future tax liabilities 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate described above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
see note for our statutory to effective tax rate reconciliation for the three years ended december  discontinued operations and related taxes on discontinued operations in fiscal we settled a foreign tax liability relating to our wireless networking product group sale  which made up the majority of our loss of million million net of tax from discontinued operations 
in fiscal we reached a settlement relating to remaining patent rights litigation connected with this sale 
after the settlement payment  the remaining accrual of million million net of tax was released and is classified and presented as discontinued operations 
in fiscal  the company was presented with an additional tax claim by a foreign jurisdiction 
the company incurred research and defense costs for the claim of million and ultimately settled the claim for million net of a million tax reserve  resulting in a net tax charge from discontinued operations of million 
therefore discontinued operations were a net loss of million for backlog our product sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders become non cancelable thirty days prior to scheduled delivery for standard products and ninety days prior to scheduled delivery for semi 
table of contents custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
additionally  we believe backlog can fall disproportionately to consumption rates in periods of weak end market demand since production lead times can be shorter 
conversely  we believe backlog can grow faster than consumption in periods of strong end market demand as production and delivery times increase and some customers may increase orders in excess of their current consumption to reduce their own risk of production disruptions 
our year end backlog for was million  for it was million  and it was million 
although not always the case  we believe backlog can be an indicator of performance for approximately the next two quarters 
see business outlook 
business outlook as we announced via our fourth quarter earnings press release filed with our current report on form k  both on january   we anticipated revenues for the first quarter to be down between to sequentially due primarily to normal seasonality in our consumer and computing markets 
based on this outlook  we expected earnings per diluted share of approximately to  excluding the effect on our consolidated statement of operations of approximately million from the reversal of a tax reserve relating to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the tax reserve reversal 
impact of inflation and changing prices the semiconductor industry has  for several decades  experienced a phenomenon of continual decline in sales prices per unit 
we experience this phenomenon and it brings unique challenges to managing our business 
in order to increase revenues  we must increase units of product made and shipped at a much higher rate than that of the attendant revenue gain 
this leads to capacity and production management issues and requires a large investment in research and development to regularly introduce new products that enable us to maintain our average unit selling prices 
at the same time we are faced with many fixed costs in our business that increase at the same rate of general inflation in the economy and must be managed carefully and aggressively in order to maintain operating margins 
these characteristics of revenue pressure from selling price  the need to invest heavily in research and development and inflation prone fixed costs means that earning a reasonable return for our shareholders is challenging 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations at december  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years future minimum operating lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments standby letters of credit total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments primarily include test  assembly and production equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments include purchase orders for million for externally produced wafers 
we 
table of contents utilize standby letters of credit primarily to provide security for various contracts or services such as workers compensation million  environmental items million and to provide security for certain vendor relationships 
these standby letters of credit have annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any guarantees that would affect our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
we do not have any relationships with other parties that would have a material negative impact on our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including our treasury share repurchase program  our dividend program  the requisite capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
at december   our total shareholders equity was billion 
at that date we also had million in cash and short term securities see notes and  as well as million in long term investments 
we have no debt outstanding and believe we would be able to access debt capital of varying amounts and terms if  as and when a desire or need therefore was identified and approved by our board of directors 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three fiscal years ended december  are presented in this summarized table fiscal years ended dec  dec  dec  millions sources of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes exercise of stock options  warrants and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan uses of cash business improvement investments business acquisitions and divestitures  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds returned to shareholders stock repurchases dividends paid cash investment management activities decrease increase in investments and foreign exchange effects net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in each of the three fiscal years ended december   our primary sources of cash have generated amounts ranging from almost million to over million 
aggregately  over the three years presented 
table of contents above  our cash generation has been million 
we have returned more than that amount to shareholders via our stock repurchase programs and our dividend payments  which aggregate over the same three year period to million 
our basic aim is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities against a relatively fixed investment and to return the majority of that cash flow to stockholders 
we also will continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that may further improve our base business with prospects of a proper return 
our acquisitions  if any  might be made for either cash or stock consideration or a combination of both 
volatility in the business environment we operate in may cause these amounts to vary from year to year 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments noted above  when combined with the lack of any outstanding long or short term debt obligations  give us the flexibility to continue to return much of our free cash flow to our stockholders while also pursuing business improvement opportunities for our future 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase primarily reflects our increased sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of this comparative quarter sales increase was 
inventories increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  our inventory levels continue to increase more slowly than our cost of sales activity reflecting improved inventory turns ratio 
we believe our overall working capital investment can be managed to be relatively constant in relation to our volume of business activity measured by sales revenues and unit volumes for the foreseeable future 
our standard trade receivable terms range from net to net days 
from time to time  management has made exceptions to these standard terms for various business and competitive reasons and extended the terms up to days 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in our expenditures again focused on expanding available capacity at our supply chain partners for both our wafer and assembly test requirements for continuing unit volume growth as we did in in our expenditures focused on similar test packaging equipment and expenditures related to preparing for our campus consolidation in florida 
proceeds from exercises of stock options and our stock purchase plan in we again enjoyed increased cash flow from stock plans exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
at more than million for the fiscal year  cash collected from such exercises exceeded million in and million in the level of such cash inflow to us in future periods is subject to certain market forces we don t control 
additionally  we have changed the mix of new share based equity incentive grants to a larger proportion of restricted and deferred stock units from stock options 
restricted and deferred stock units do not yield proceeds from an exercise event as do stock options 
therefore we believe option proceeds should generally decline over the next several years 
stock repurchases and dividends we currently have in effect an active stock repurchase program and  announced in february  a per share dividend for the first quarter of fiscal both programs represent our major effort to return a portion of our operating cash flow to our shareholders and we currently intend to continue both programs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents transactions with related and certain other parties former related party intersil had a contract in place with a former related party  which expired in mid year fiscal  under which they provided a specified percentage of intersil s test and package services 
the terms of the contract were the result of arms length negotiations and  in the opinion of management  were no less favorable than those that could be obtained from non affiliated parties 
at the time the contract was entered into  the companies shared a common board member and intersil once held an equity position in the company 
although the company continues to procure a portion of its test and package services from this firm  it utilizes other vendors for these services as well 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have included our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimates  in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimates  and the possible effects on our financial condition 
the six accounting estimation processes discussed below are the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  distributor  oem and warranty allowances  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill accounting for income taxes  and fair value of stock based compensation these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create changes  including adverse ones  to our statement of operations and financial position 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  or receivables allowance december  in millions december  in millions gross trade receivables receivables allowance other allowances net trade receivables our receivables allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but will have such an inability  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which at december  equaled of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons  such as 
table of contents bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then provide an allowance for a portion or all of the customer s balance 
distributor  oem and warranty allowances  or other allowances shown in the immediately foregoing table relating to receivables allowance as other allowances  are our allowances for various eventual customer credits 
this is a combination of distributor  original equipment manufacturer oem and warranty allowances 
distributor allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
revenue is recognized from sales to our customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor allowances are amounts within our trade receivable allowance section of the balance sheet that estimate the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on the inventory that is held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
as the amount of inventory held by international distributors that will be adjusted in the future cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof  we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions to estimate adjustments 
the international distributor allowances comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component of international distributor allowances is the price protection allowance  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices which are common in semiconductors and other electronic components 
this allowance is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation allowance  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
specific allowances for our oem customers  of which various types of returns are the largest component  totaled million at december   warranty allowances  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million at december  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  or inventory allowances we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market as described in the notes to the financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will recoup through sales on our inventory cannot be known with exact certainty as of the date of this filing  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although due to the commonality between our products  raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we provide an allowance for of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
reviews are conducted of excess inventory on a monthly basis 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete 
we provide an allowance for approximately to of the standard cost of the excess inventory 
we believe that this allowance represents the portion we will not be able to recover when we attempt to sell this inventory due to our new product next generation introductions and other technological advancements 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete during the process described above  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization specific to that inventory 
inventory allowances totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million at december  and million on gross inventory of million at december  product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory allowances 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical revenue 
historical sales may not 
table of contents accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to provide allowances for and scrap obsolete inventory 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill pursuant to our adoption of sfas in  we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and found no impairment 
according to our accounting policy  we also perform an annual review during the fourth quarter of each subsequent year  and have found no impairment in any period to date 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is tested under a two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
at december  we had five reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to identify potential impairment  compares the calculated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on goodwill since adopting sfas accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide income tax liabilities 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate as well as the actual taxes ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
the aforementioned temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nol s arising out of the xicor acquisition and research credit carryforwards 
fair value of stock based compensation under sfas r  the fair value of the grant compensation cost is calculated by us on the date of grant using a lattice method 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the shorter of vesting life or requisite service period 
calculating fair value requires us to estimate certain key assumptions in the valuation model 
these are expected stock price volatility  the expected risk free interest rate in the market  and expected forfeitures of options by employees due to their termination before vesting is fully earned  and annualized dividend yield 
volatility is one of the most significant determinants of fair value 
our expected volatility is estimated from a blend of estimated price movement activity implied by our traded options and the actual historic 
table of contents volatility of our stock price 
we estimate our expected risk free interest rate by using the zero coupon us treasury rate at the time of the grant related to the expected term of the grant 
expected forfeitures must be estimated to reduce the gross calculation of fair value to an amount expected to be recorded in the financial statements 
we estimate forfeitures for the first year of vesting  based on historical information about turnover for each appropriate employee level 
we estimate the annualized dividend yield by dividing the current annualized dividend by the closing stock price on the date of grant 
thereafter  as vesting tiers within an option are more frequent until fully vested  forfeitures are no longer estimated but instead recorded as they actually occur 
calculating fair value for our options and deferred stock units that have a performance measurement element to them also requires us to estimate the likely actual performance before the performance is complete 
we do this by adjusting the forfeiture rate to include the expectation of actual performance at the time the calculation is made for purposes of amortizing the compensation appropriately 
such performance based instruments  depending upon the term of required performance  may need to be remeasured as frequently as quarterly 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information with regard to our performance based grants 
these estimates of key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding future expectations and are re examined on a regular basis 
when such re examinations of the key assumptions lead to significant changes to the calculation inputs  it can have a material affect on the amount of stock based compensation that will be recognized in aggregate or in any period 
this may mean more volatility in our reported earnings due to changed facts and circumstances surrounding the company s use of stock compensation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to three market risks interest rate risk  credit risk and secondary market risk 
the company s investments are primarily held in money market funds and auction rate securities ars 
some of these investments are insured for credit risk 
ars s are subject to the risk that the secondary market might fail to provide the liquidity opportunity at the rate reset points 
this risk  which we have recently encountered with regard to our certain of our ars s  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
late in fiscal  we have recorded a million temporary impairment in value against approximately million of our ars s at december  additionally  the temporary impairment grew to million at the end of our first month of fiscal see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative and qualitative details 
as a result of our portfolio shift toward short term investments in recent quarters  our interest income should therefore be more volatile and vary with short term rates more than if we had a larger commitment to long term investments 
our long term investments are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk 
our long term securities portfolio at december  was made up primarily of state and municipality issued securities with high credit ratings  therefore  we believe the credit risk is very low 
with regard to interest rate risk on our long term securities portfolio  we believe a point increase in long term rates basis points would result in 
table of contents an immaterial unrealized loss on our approximately million portfolio at that date 
since our long term investments are classified as held to maturity  such a theoretical unrealized loss would not be recorded unless the investment was sold 
at december   we had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of approximately million  which was to hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as our hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
there was no net gain or loss on foreign exchange contracts for during  we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was million  at december  the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions fiscal year ended december  december  loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts at year end fair value of open contracts at year end our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at december  will have a negligible impact on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
see also note in our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein this annual report on form k 
a substantial majority of our revenues billed outside the us are billed and collected in us dollars 
therefore we do not believe we have material risk to revenues due to currency rate fluctuations between billing and collection of funds for those amounts billed in other currencies
