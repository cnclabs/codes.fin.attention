part i item description of business general lannett company  inc the company  lannett  we  or us was incorporated in under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation 
we develop  manufacture  market and distribute generic versions of pharmaceutical products 
the company reports financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis  the most recent being the fiscal year ended june  all references herein to a fiscal year refer to the company s fiscal year ending june the company is focused on increasing our share of the generic pharmaceutical market 
we plan to improve our financial performance by expanding our line of generic products  increasing unit sales to current customers and reducing overhead and administrative costs 
in addition  our recent acquisition of cody laboratories  inc allows us to work toward vertically integrating our dosage form manufacturing in order to reduce active pharmaceutical ingredients api costs 
some of the new generic products sold by lannett were developed and are manufactured by lannett while other products are manufactured by other companies 
the products manufactured or distributed by lannett and their brand name equivalents are identified in the section entitled products in item of this form k 

table of contents over the past several years  lannett has consistently devoted resources to research and development r d projects  including new generic product offerings 
the costs of these r d efforts are expensed during the periods incurred 
the company believes that such investments may be recovered in future years as it submits applications to the food and drug administration fda  and when it receives marketing approval from the fda to distribute such products 
in addition to using cash generated from its operations  the company has entered into financing agreements with third parties to provide additional cash when needed 
these financing agreements are more fully described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
the company has embarked on a plan to grow in future years 
in addition to organic growth to be achieved through its own r d efforts  the company has also initiated marketing projects with other companies in order to expand future revenue 
the company expects that its growing list of generic drugs under development will drive future growth 
the company also intends to use the infrastructure it has created  and to continually devote resources to additional r d projects 
the following steps outline lannett s efforts research and development process there are numerous stages in the generic drug development process formulation and analytical method development after a drug candidate is selected for future sales  product development chemists perform various experiments on the incorporation of active ingredients into a dosage form 
these experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for the company s subsequent development process 
various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator drug 
during this time  the company may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients 
during the formulation phase  the company s research and development chemists begin to develop an analytical  laboratory testing method 
the successful development of this test method will allow the company to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future 
all of the information used in the final formulation  including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate  will be included as part of the chemical  manufacturing and controls section of the abbreviated new drug application anda submitted to the fda in the generic drug application 
scale up after the product development scientists and the r d chemists agree on a final formulation to use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process  the company will attempt to increase the batch size of the product 
the batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product 
the determination of batch size will affect the amount of raw material that is input into the manufacturing process and the number of expected tablets or capsules to be created during the production cycle 
the company attempts to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage  the available production equipment and unit sales projections 
the scaled up batch is then generally produced in the company s commercial manufacturing facilities 
during this manufacturing process  the company will document the equipment used  the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product 
this information generally referred to as the validated manufacturing process  will be included in the company s generic drug application submitted to the fda 
clinical testing after a successful scale up of the generic drug batch  the company then schedules and performs clinical testing procedures on the product if required by the fda 
these procedures  which are generally outsourced to third parties  include testing the absorption of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug 
the results of this testing are then documented and reported to the company to determine the success of the generic drug product 
success  in this context  means the successful comparison of the company s product related to the innovator product 
since bioequivalence and a stable 
table of contents formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the fda s good manufacturing quality standards  lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy  which are generally required by the fda for innovator drug approvals  are unnecessary for generic companies 
if the results are successful  the company will continue the collection of documentation and information for assembly of the drug application 
submission of the anda for fda review and approval the anda process became formalized under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  also known as the hatch waxman act hatch waxman act 
an anda represents a generic drug company s application to the fda to manufacture and or distribute a drug that is the generic equivalent to an already approved brand named innovator drug 
once bioequivalence studies are complete  the generic drug company submits an anda to the fda for marketing approval 
according to the september issue of generics bulletin the current review time exceeds months 
while we have received approvals in months we have also gone well beyond the as discussed in the article 
we see no improvement in this in the short term 
when a generic drug company files an anda with the fda  it must certify that no patents are listed in the orange book  the fda s reference listing of approved drugs and listed patents 
an anda filer must certify  with respect to each application  whether the filer is challenging a patent that no patent was filed for the listed drug a paragraph i certification  that the patent has expired a paragraph ii certification  that the patent will expire on a specified date and the anda filer will not market the drug until that date a paragraph iii certification  or that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture  use  or sale of the new drug a paragraph iv certification 
a paragraph iv certification can trigger an automatic month stay of the anda if the innovator company files a claim 
it will delay the approval of the generic company s anda 
currently  lannett has filed no paragraph iv certifications with its andas 
over the past several years  the company has hired additional personnel in product development  production  formulation and the r d laboratory 
lannett believes that its ability to select appropriate products for development  develop such products on a timely basis  obtain fda approval  and achieve economies in production will be critical for its success in the generic industry 
the strategy involves a combination of decisions focusing on long term profitability and a secure market position with fewer challenges from competitors 
competition in generic pharmaceutical manufacturing should continue to grow as more pharmaceutical products lose patent protection 
however  the company believes that with strong technical know how  low overhead expenses  and efficient product development  manufacturing and marketing  it can remain competitive 
it is the intention of the company to reinvest as much capital as possible to develop new products as the success of any generic pharmaceutical manufacturer depends on its ability to continually introduce new generic products to the market 
over time  if a generic drug market for a specific product remains stable and consumer demand remains consistent  it is likely that additional generic manufacturing companies will pursue the generic product by developing it  submitting an anda  and potentially receiving marketing approval from the fda 
if this occurs  the generic competition for the drug increases  and a company s market share may drop 
in addition to reduced unit sales  the unit selling price may also drop due to the product s availability from additional suppliers 
this may have the effect of reducing a generic company s future net sales of the product 
due to these factors that may potentially affect a generic company s future results of operations  the ability to properly assess the competitive effect of new products  including market share  the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion  is critical to a generic company s r d plan 
a generic company may be able to reduce the potential exposure to competitive influences that negatively affect its sales and profits by having several drug candidates in its r d pipeline 
as such  a generic company may be able to avoid becoming materially dependent on the sales of one drug 
please refer to the following section entitled products 
table of contents for more descriptive information on the products the company currently produces or sells 
unlike the branded  innovator companies  lannett does not develop new molecules nevertheless it has filed and received patents at its cody wyoming facility with an additional one pending 
however  the typical intellectual property in the generic drug industry are the andas that generic drug companies own 
validated pharmaceutical capabilities lannett s manufacturing facility consists of  square feet on acres owned by the company 
in addition  the company owns a  square foot building located within mile of the manufacturing facility  which houses packaging  warehousing  shipping  r d and a number of administrative functions 
in addition  we lease a third building located several miles from the manufacturing facility  consisting of  square feet 
this building is currently being used as a warehouse 
the manufacturing facility of lannett s wholly owned subsidiary  cody laboratories  inc cody consists of  square feet on acres in cody  wyoming 
cody leases the facility from cody lci realty  llc  wyoming  which is owned by lannett and by an officer of cody 
many fda regulations relating to current good manufacturing practices cgmp have been adopted by the company in the last several years 
in designing its facilities  full attention was given to material flow  equipment and automation  quality control and inspection 
a granulator  an automatic film coating machine  high speed tablet presses  blenders  encapsulators  fluid bed dryers  high shear mixers and high speed bottle filling are a few examples of the sophisticated product development  manufacturing and packaging equipment the company uses 
in addition  the company s quality control laboratory facilities are equipped with high precision instruments  such as automated high pressure liquid chromatographs  gas chromatographs  robots and laser particle sizers 
lannett continues to pursue its comprehensive plan for improving and maintaining quality control and quality assurance programs for its pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities 
the fda periodically inspects the company s production facilities to determine the company s compliance with the fda s manufacturing standards 
typically  after the fda completes its inspection  it will issue the company a report  entitled a form  containing the fda s observations of possible violations of cgmp which may be minor or severe in nature 
the degree of severity of the observation is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cgmp violation  any consequences on the consumer of the products  and whether the observation is subject to a warning letter from the fda 
by strictly enforcing the various fda guidelines  namely current good manufacturing practices cgmps and good laboratory practices cglps  as well as adherence to lannett s standard operating procedures sops the company has successfully minimized the number of observations in its fda inspections 
sales and customer relationships the company sells its pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors  drug wholesalers  chain drug retailers  private label distributors  mail order pharmacies  other pharmaceutical manufacturers  managed care organizations  hospital buying groups and health maintenance organizations 
it promotes its products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications  and bids 
the company also licenses the marketing of its products to other manufacturers and or marketers in private label agreements 
the company continues to expand its sales to the major chain drug stores 
its policy of maintaining an adequate inventory and fulfilling orders in a timely manner has contributed to the company s reputation among its customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals 
its cody labs subsidiary sells to dosage form manufacturers 

table of contents management the company has been focused on increasing the size and quality of its management team in anticipation of continued growth 
managers from large  established  brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies have been brought in to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team 
as the company continues to grow  additional managers may need to be added to the team 
we intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge and expertise within the company  in order to achieve the company s goals

in fiscal  the company began selling sulfamethoxazole w trimethoprim smz tmp 
because of a market opportunity  sales of smz tmp grew from of sales in to of sales in  but declined to of net sales in this product is not included in the above key products because the supply agreement for the product expired in august and was not renewed 
the company has two products containing butalbital 
one of the products  butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules  has been manufactured and sold by lannett for more than nine years 
the other butalbital product  butalbital with aspirin  caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules is manufactured by jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp 
lannett began buying this product from jsp and selling it to its customers in december both products  which are in orally administered capsule dosage forms  are prescribed to treat tension headaches caused by contractions of the muscles in the neck and shoulder area and migraine 
the drug is prescribed primarily for adults of various demographic backgrounds 
migraine headache is an increasingly prevalent condition in the united states 
as conditions continue to grow  the demand for effective medical treatments will continue to grow 
common side effects of drugs which contain butalbital include dizziness and drowsiness 
the company notes that although new innovator drugs to treat migraine headaches have been introduced by brand name drug companies  there is still a loyal following of doctors and consumers who prefer to use butalbital products for treatment 
as the brand name companies continue to promote products containing butalbital  like fiorinal  the company expects to continue to produce and sell its generic butalbital products 
digoxin tablets are produced and marketed with two different potencies and milligrams per tablet 
this product is manufactured by jsp 
lannett began buying this product from jsp and selling it to its customers in september digoxin tablets are used to treat congestive heart failure in patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds

with its distribution of these products  lannett competes in a market which is currently controlled by two branded levothyroxine sodium tablet products abbott laboratories synthroid and monarch pharmaceutical s levoxyl as well as generic competition from mylan laboratories and sandoz 
new products in fiscal  lannett received anda approvals from the fda 
we received only anda approval in fiscal the following contains more specific details regarding our latest approvals 
market data is obtained from wolters kluwer 
in july  lannett received a letter from the fda with approval to market and launch baclofen mg tablets 
baclofen is the generic version of lioresal and is a muscle relaxer used to treat symptoms of multiple sclerosis 
according to wolters kluwer  total sales of generic baclofen mg tablets were million at average wholesale price awp in in august  lannett received two letters from the fda with approval to market and launch hydrochlorothiazide mg mg tablets

rifampin is the generic version of rifadin and is used to reduce the number of meningococcal bacteria in the nose and throat 
according to wolters kluwer  total sales of generic rifampin mg mg capsules at awp was million in in april  lannett received a letter from the fda with approval to market and launch dipyridamole mg  mg mg tablets 
dipyridamole is the generic version of persantine and is used to reduce the formation of blood clots in people who have had heart valve surgery 
according to wolters kluwer  total sales of generic dipyridamole mg  mg mg tablets at awp was million in additional products are currently under development 
these products are either orally administered  solid dosage products ie tablet capsule or oral solutions  topicals or parentarels designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  clinical testing and fda review 
the cost associated with each product currently under development is dependent on numerous factors not limited to the following the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the price of the raw materials  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies depending on the fda s orange book classification and other developmental factors 
the estimated cost to develop a new generic product ranges from  to million 

table of contents in addition  as one of the oldest generic drug manufacturers in the country formed in  lannett currently owns several andas that are dormant on the company s records for products which it does not manufacture and market 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling them 
if the company decides to introduce one of these products into the consumer market  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  the raw material supplier or another major feature of the previously approved anda 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for an anda supplement is similar to that of a new anda 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development or manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
the following table summarizes key information related to the company s r d products 
the column headings are defined as follows stage of r d defines the current stage of the r d product in the development process  as of the date of this filing 
regulatory requirement defines whether the r d product is or is expected to be a new anda submission  an anda supplement  or a grand fathered product not requiring specific fda approval 
number of products defines the number of products in r d at the stage noted 
in this context  a product means any finished dosage form  including all potencies  containing the same api or combination of apis and which represents a generic version of the same reference listed drug rld or innovator drug  identified in the fda s orange book

table of contents raw materials and finished goods inventory suppliers the raw materials used by the company in the production process consist of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms and are generally available from several sources 
fda approval is required in connection with the process of using most active ingredient suppliers 
in addition to the raw materials purchased for the production process  the company purchases certain finished dosage inventories  including capsule  tablet  and oral liquid products 
the company then sells these finished dosage products directly to its customers along with the finished dosage products internally manufactured 
if suppliers of a certain material or finished product are limited  the company will generally take certain precautionary steps to avoid a disruption in supply  such as finding a secondary supplier or ordering larger quantities 
the company s primary finished product inventory supplier is jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp  in bohemia  new york 
purchases of finished goods inventory from jsp accounted for approximately of the company s inventory purchases in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal on march   the company entered into an agreement with jsp for the exclusive distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock 
the jsp products covered under the agreement included butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levothyroxine sodium tablets  sold generically and under the brand name unithroid 
the term of the agreement is ten years  beginning on march  and continuing through march  refer to the materials contract footnote to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms  conditions  and financial impact of this agreement 
during the term of the agreement  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of jsp s products being distributed by the company 
the minimum quantity to be purchased in the first year of the agreement was million 
thereafter  the minimum purchase quantity increases by million per year up to million for the last year of the ten year contract 
the company has met the minimum purchase requirement for the first four years of the contract  but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to continue to do so in the future 
if the company does not meet the minimum purchase requirements  jsp s sole remedy is to terminate the agreement 
in august  the company signed an agreement with a finished goods provider to purchase  at fixed prices  and distribute a certain generic pharmaceutical product in the united states 
purchases of finished goods inventory from this provider accounted for approximately of the company s costs of purchased inventory in fiscal  in  and in the term of the agreement was three years  beginning on august  and continuing through august  following its expiration on august   the agreement was not renewed 
the company signed supply and development agreements with olive healthcare  wintac and unichem of india  orion pharma of finland  azad pharma ag of switzerland  pharmaseed in israel and banner pharmacaps and catalent in the united states 
the company is also in negotiations with companies in israel for similar new product initiatives in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by third parties 
customers and marketing the company sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors  generic drug distributors  mail order pharmacies  group purchasing organizations  chain drug stores  and other pharmaceutical companies 
the 
table of contents industry s largest wholesale distributors  mckesson  cardinal health  and amerisource bergen  accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company s largest chain drug store customer  walgreens  accounted for of net sales in fiscal the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  and has experienced no significant collection problems to date 
generally  the company requires no collateral from its customers 
sales to these wholesale customers include indirect sales  which represent sales to third party entities  such as independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
for more information on chargebacks  refer to the section entitled chargebacks in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
these indirect sale transactions are recorded on lannett s books as sales to the wholesale customers 
the company believes that retail level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products 
in the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes  the company believes that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply 
as such  lannett attempts to develop and maintain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains  wholesale distributors  and mail order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of the company s products through whatever channel the consumer prefers 
although the company has agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of its sales  there are no minimum purchase quantities with these agreements 
the company promotes its products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications  and bids 
the company also markets its products through private label arrangements  under which lannett produces its products with a label containing the name and logo of a customer 
this practice is commonly referred to as private label business 
it allows the company to leverage its internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well respected pharmaceutical dosage suppliers 
the focus of the company s sales efforts is the relationships it creates with its customer accounts 
strong customer relationships have created a positive platform for lannett to increase its sales volumes 
advertising in the generic pharmaceutical industry is generally limited to trade publications  read by retail pharmacists  wholesale purchasing agents and other pharmaceutical decision makers 
historically and in fiscal   and  the company s advertising expenses were immaterial 
when the customer and the company s sales representatives make contact  the company will generally offer to supply the customer its products at fixed prices 
if accepted  the customer s purchasing department will coordinate the purchase  receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets 
once a customer accepts the company s supply of product  the customer typically expects a high standard of service  including shipping product in a timely manner  maintaining convenient and effective customer service functions  and retaining a mutually beneficial dialogue of communication 
the company believes that although the generic pharmaceutical industry is a commodity industry where price is the primary factor for sales success  these additional service standards are also important to the customers that rely on a consistent source of supply 
competition the manufacture and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry 
competition is based primarily on price  service and quality 
our competitive advantage is based on our ability to provide superior customer service fulfilling customer s in critical need of inventory  carrying excess finished goods inventory and providing added value by insuring the company s products are available from national suppliers as well as our own warehouse 
the modernization of our facilities  hiring of 
table of contents experienced staff  and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved our competitive cost position over the past five years 
the company competes with other manufacturers and marketers of generic and brand drugs 
each product manufactured and or sold by lannett has a different set of competitors 
the list below identifies the companies with which lannett primarily competes for each of its major products 
product primary competitors butalbital with aspirin and caffeine  with and without codeine phosphate capsules watson pharmaceuticals  breckenridge pharmaceutical manufactured by anabolic laboratories digoxin tablets glaxosmithkline  caraco pharmaceutical laboratories  westward pharmaceuticals doxycycline par pharmaceuticals  ranbaxy laboratories levothyroxine sodium tablets abbott laboratories  monarch pharmaceuticals  mylan laboratories  sandoz  forest laboratories primidone tablets watson pharmaceuticals  qualitest pharmaceuticals  url  westward pharmaceuticals  amneal pharmaceuticals  impax labs sulfamethoxazole w trimethoprim url mutual pharmaceuticals  sandoz  vista  teva unithroid tablets abbott laboratories  monarch pharmaceuticals  mylan laboratories  sandoz government regulation pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government  principally by the fda and the drug enforcement agency dea and to a lesser extent  by other federal regulatory bodies and state governments 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substance act  and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  pricing  advertising  and promotion of the company s generic drug products 
noncompliance with applicable regulations can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  personal and or corporate prosecution and debarment  and refusal of the government to approve new drug applications 
the fda also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug products 
generally  fda approval is required before a prescription drug can be marketed 
a new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use 
new drugs are typically developed and submitted to the fda by companies expecting to brand the product and sell it as a new medical treatment 
the fda review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate 
however  less burdensome approval procedures may be used for generic equivalents 
typically  the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the brand innovator drug 

table of contents there are currently three ways to obtain fda approval of a drug new drug applications nda unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following paragraphs is available  a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the fda complete clinical studies to establish a drug s safety and efficacy 
abbreviated new drug applications anda an anda is similar to an nda except that the fda generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy 
however  it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect 
bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved 
in addition to establishing a new anda procedure  this act created statutory protections for approved brand name drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid 
prior to this act  the fda gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug 
additionally  the hatch waxman act extends for up to five years the term of a product or use patent covering a drug to compensate the patent holder for the reduction of the effective market life of a patent due to federal regulatory review 
with respect to certain drugs not covered by patents  the act sets specified time periods of two to ten years during which andas for generic drugs cannot become effective or  under certain circumstances  cannot be filed if the branded drug was approved after december  lannett  like most other generic drug companies  uses the anda process for the submission of its developmental generic drug candidates 
paper new drug applications paper nda also known as a b for a drug that is identical to a drug first approved after  a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full nda procedure 
instead  it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports 
the manufacturer must also submit  if the fda so requires  bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects  within an acceptable range  as the previously approved innovator drug 
because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post drugs may not be available  this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers and the resulting approved product will not be interchangeable with the innovator drug as an anda drug would be unless bioeqivalency testing were undertaken and approved by fda 
moreover  the utility of paper ndas has been further diminished by the recently broadened availability of the anda process  as described above 
among the requirements for new drug approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s methods conform to the fda s current good manufacturing practice 
the cgmp regulations must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured 
in complying with the standards set forth in the cgmp regulations  the company must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
failure to comply with the cgmp regulations risks possible fda action  including but not limited to  the seizure of noncomplying drug products or  through the department of justice  enjoining the manufacture of such products 
the company is also subject to federal  state  and local laws of general applicability  such as laws regulating working conditions and the storage  transportation  or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances  hazardous waste  or environmental contaminants 
the company monitors its compliance with all environmental laws 
the company is in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies 
as a publicly traded company we are also subject to significant regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of since its enactment  we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and we continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements 

table of contents lannett operates in a highly regulated environment and is responsible for maintaining compliance with many regulatory requirements 
the us department of justice  acting on behalf of the us drug enforcement administration dea  recently issued a letter to the company requesting additional information on certain record keeping matters regarding a dea inspection of lannett s facilities 
the company intends to fully comply with this and all requests for information that occur from time to time as a normal course of business research and development the company incurred research and development r d expenses of approximately  in   in  and  in the r d spending includes spending on bioequivalence studies  internal development resources  as well as outsourced development 
while the company manages all r d from our offices in philadelphia  we have also been taking advantage of favorable development costs in other countries 
we have alliances with various companies that either act as contract research organizations or active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers as well as dosage form manufacturers 
in addition  us based clinical research organizations have been engaged for product development to enhance our internal development 
fixed payment arrangements are established with these development partners  and can range from  to  to develop a drug 
development payments are normally scheduled in advance  based on milestones

risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
if we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner 
there are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products  including developing  testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner  
table of contents receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner  the availability  on commercially reasonable terms  of raw materials  including active pharmaceutical ingredients and other key ingredients  developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming  costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products  and commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by the listing with the fda of patents that have the effect of potentially delaying approval of the off patent product by up to months  and in some cases  such patents have issued and been listed with the fda after the key chemical patent on the branded drug product has expired or been litigated  causing additional delays in obtaining approval 
as a result of these and other difficulties  products currently in development by lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing 
if any of our products  when developed and approved  cannot be successfully or timely commercialized  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped  even if we are successful in commercializing those products 
if kv were to prevail in its countersuit against us  and the company were subject to paying damages or were prohibited from selling the prenatal multivitamin in the future  it could have an adverse impact on the company 
in early june  the company filed a declaratory judgment suit against kv pharmaceuticals  drugtech corp  and ther rx corp collectively kv 
the complaint sought declaratory judgment for non infringement and invalidity of certain patents owned by kv 
the complaint further sought declaratory judgment of anti trust violations and federal and state unfair competition violations for actions taken by kv in securing and enforcing these patents 
after the complaint was filed  kv countered with a motion for a temporary restraining order tro to prevent the company from launching its multivitamin with mineral capsules mmcs  due to alleged patent and trademark infringement issues 
the tro was heard and  ultimately  resulted in a conclusion by the court that the company s product label on the mmcs should be modified 
kv also countered with claims of infringement by the company of kv s patents seeking the company s profits for sales of mmcs or other monetary relief  preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  attorney s fees and a finding of willful infringement 
the case is currently in its discovery phase with a hearing expected in january the company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and intends to vigorously defend its position 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
we face strong competition in our generic product business 
revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents for brand name products and related exclusivity periods expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration 
as competing off patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products for which no separate regulatory approval is required  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins 
our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix  our product pricing  and our costs to manufacture or purchase products 

table of contents our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix 
our sales of products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than do the products we purchase and resell 
as a result  our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period 
factors that may cause our sales mix to vary include the amount of new product introductions  marketing exclusivity  if any  which may be obtained on certain new products  the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products  the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers  and the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us 
the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for our products  the costs to purchase products from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts  our sales of generic products may suffer 
many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to us pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  and engaging in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs  which could have an impact on products that we are developing 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means  our sales may decline 
if we experience a material decline in product sales  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will suffer 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
this is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the branded product is expiring  an area where infringement litigation is prevalent  and in the case of new branded products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products 
litigation may be costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  if we infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our 
table of contents right to develop or manufacture products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials  our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded 
we are required to identify the supplier s of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the fda 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application 
however  some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and  in some of our drug applications  only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified  even in instances where multiple sources exist 
to the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time  and at reasonable cost  or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the fda  our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease  and our development and sales and marketing efforts could be delayed 
our policies regarding returns  allowances and chargebacks  and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers  may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods 
based on industry practice  generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post sale inventory allowances 
under these arrangements  from time to time  we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing 
therefore  if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products  we would likely reduce the price of our product 
as a result  we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products  which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided 
like our competitors  we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals  group purchasing organizations  pharmacies or other customers 
a chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler s end customer pays for a product 
although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods  we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns  allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties  and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against 
table of contents lannett  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
rising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability 
the cost of insurance  including workers compensation  product liability and general liability insurance  have risen in prior years and may increase in the future 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease certain coverages to mitigate these costs 
these increases  and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverages  could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of key personnel 
if the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel 
as such  we have entered into employment agreements with of our senior executive officers 
significant balances of intangible assets  including product rights acquired  are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges  which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquired contractual rights to market and distribute products are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization and related impairment charges identified to date 
we determined the initial cost by referring to the original fair value of the assets exchanged 
future amortization periods for product rights are based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an additional impairment test on the affected asset and  if evidence of impairment exists  we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset 
such a charge would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
extensive industry regulation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our business  especially our product development  manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
all pharmaceutical companies  including lannett  are subject to extensive  complex  costly and evolving regulation by the federal government  principally the fda and to a lesser extent by the dea  and state government agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substances act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  packing  labeling  storing  record keeping  safety  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
under these regulations  we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda  the dea and other authorities  which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
in addition  the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  and other fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of 
table of contents regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
any such sanctions  if imposed  could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the fda under a consent decree  depending upon the actual terms of such decree 
although we have instituted internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could materially harm our business 
certain of our vendors are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections 
the process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous  time consuming and costly  and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments 
we are dependent on receiving fda and other governmental or third party approvals prior to manufacturing  marketing and shipping our products 
consequently  there is always the chance that we will not obtain fda or other necessary approvals  or that the rate  timing and cost of such approvals  will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations 
we carry inventories of certain product s in anticipation of launch  and if such product s are not subsequently launched  we may be required to write off the related inventory 
federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities 
the impact of this new requirement and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain  and could adversely affect our business 
sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains 
as a result  a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market  and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers  including lannett 
for the year ended june   our three largest customers accounted for  and respectively  of our net sales 
the loss of any of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows 
in addition  the company has no long term supply agreements with its customers which would require them to purchase our products

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies include those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
consolidation of variable interest entity the company consolidates any variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary 
the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating a vie do not represent additional claims on our general assets  rather  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated vie 
conversely  assets recognized as a result of consolidating a vie do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets 
reflected in the june  and balance sheets are consolidated vie assets of and million  respectively  which is comprised mainly of land and a building 
vie liabilities consist of a mortgage on that property in the amount of and million at june  and  respectively 
this vie was initially consolidated by cody  as cody has been the primary beneficiary 
cody has then been consolidated within lannett s financial statements since its acquisition in april revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when its products are shipped 
at this point  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and provisions for rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as rebates  chargebacks and returns payable and as reductions to net sales 
the change in the reserves for various sales adjustments may not be proportionally equal to the change in sales because of changes in both the product and the customer mix 
increased sales to wholesalers will generally require additional accruals as they are the primary recipient of chargebacks and rebates 
incentives offered to secure sales vary from product to product 
provisions for estimated rebates and promotional credits are estimated based upon contractual terms 
provisions for other customer credits  such as price adjustments  returns  
table of contents and chargebacks  require management to make subjective judgments on customer mix 
unlike branded innovator drug companies  lannett does not use information about product levels in distribution channels from third party sources  such as ims and wolters kluwer  in estimating future returns and other credits 
lannett calculates a chargeback rebate rate based on contractual terms with its customers and applies this rate to customer sales 
the only variable is customer mix  and this assumption is based on historical data and sales expectations 
the chargeback rebate reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis by management using several ratios and calculated metrics 
as we continue to obtain additional information about our historical experience for chargebacks  rebates and returns  we also update our estimates of the required reserves 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic distributors  retail pharmacy chains  and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price if the price sold to the indirect customer is lower than the direct price to the wholesaler 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales by the company to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen  and mckesson  increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the expected mix of product sales to the indirect customers 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that expected chargebacks on actual sales may differ from the amounts that were assumed in the establishment of the chargeback reserves 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key chain drug store and wholesaler customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
at the time of shipment  the company estimates reserves for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement 
the reserve for rebates increases as sales to rebate eligible customers are recognized and decreases when actual rebate payments are made 
however  since rebate programs are not identical for all customers  the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of sales to customers that are eligible to receive rebates 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product returns policy that allows certain customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product s lot expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  adjusted for any changes in business practices or conditions that would cause management to believe that future product returns may differ from those returns assumed in the establishment of reserves 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as sales increase and decrease when credits are issued or payments are made for actual returns received 
the reserve for returns is included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
other adjustments other adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  which are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of a price reduction 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct 
table of contents customers  estimated declines in market prices  and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
other adjustments are included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
when competitors enter the market for existing products  shelf stock adjustments may be issued to maintain price competitiveness the following tables identify the reserves for each major category of revenue allowance and a summary of the activity for the fiscal years ended june   and unless we have specific information to indicate otherwise  actual credits issued in a given year are assumed to be related to sales recorded in prior years based on the company s returns policy 
the following tables have been revised to conform to this assumption 
for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves or reversals charged during fiscal related to sales in prior fiscal years reserves charged to net sales during fiscal related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal reserve balance as of june  for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves or reversals charged during fiscal related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves charged to net sales in fiscal related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales in fiscal reserve balance as of june  for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves or reversals charged during fiscal related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves charged to net sales in fiscal related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales in fiscal reserve balance as of june  reserve activity vs 
the total reserve for chargebacks  rebates  returns and other adjustments increased from  at june  to  at june  the increase in the reserve balance was primarily the result of our decision to record during the fourth quarter of fiscal a  provision for the expected return of of the shipments of prenatal multivitamin 
our expectation that all of the product would be returned was based on our inability to have the product specified as a brand equivalent  and information from our customers regarding their intentions to return the product 
also during our fiscal year we increased our estimated returns reserve by approximately million  based on an analysis of our historical returns experience  the average lag time between sales and returns and our understanding of the buying patterns and inventory practices of both our direct and indirect customers 
this change in estimate incorporated new information that has allowed us to better estimate the average length of time between product sales and returns 
as this change resulted from new information that has allowed us to better estimate the average length of time between product sales and returns  we consider it to be a change in estimate as defined in sfas accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
during fiscal year  we also experienced an unanticipated increase in our returns compared to historical experience that required us to record a provision of approximately million in fiscal year for returns related to sales in prior years 
we believe  however  that this increase in return was largely related to certain specific nonrecurring events 
the decline in chargeback and rebate reserves between june  and june  was due in part to a change in our sales mix away from wholesalers and toward the chain drug stores as well as a decrease in inventory levels at wholesaler distribution centers 
the following tables compare the year end reserve balances in fiscal and and the sales mix in fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended june  chargeback reserve rebate reserve return reserve other reserve fiscal year ended june  fiscal fourth quarter chain drug stores mail order wholesalers private label reserve activity vs 
the total reserves for chargebacks  rebates  returns and other adjustments decreased from  at june  to  at june  the decrease reflected a change in customer sales mix away from wholesalers and toward the chain drug stores which reduces total chargebacks because wholesalers are typically the only customers who are eligible for chargebacks and rebates 
the decrease in rebate reserve to  from  at june  was also due to the decrease in sales to wholesalers as well as a decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal there was a large rebate reserve as of june  as direct customers only direct customers are eligible to receive rebates represented a larger than usual percentage of sales in the month of june 
the following tables compare the year end reserve balances for fiscal and  and the customer sales mix in fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended  chargeback reserve rebate reserve return reserve other reserve fiscal year ended june  fiscal fourth quarter chain drug stores mail order wholesalers private label other reserves have decreased since june   due to an unusually high level of shelf stock adjustments required in the prior year 
changes in competition in the primidone market required lannett to give more of this type of credit in the prior year 
during the year  the company began to implement improvements to separately calculate the provisions  credits and reserves for chargebacks  rebates and returns including the performance of several types of analysis to ensure reserves are reasonable 
these included analysis of wholesaler versus direct or retail sales mix  revenue reserve relative to gross sales  comparison of net receivables to net sales  comparison of gross receivables to gross sales  and recalculation of wholesaler inventory levels 
because we were unable to independently verify product sales levels at the final customer  wholesaler inventory reports were used to calculate potential chargebacks and rebates based on known contracted rebate and chargeback rates 
the decrease in the chargeback reserve to  at june  from  at june  is due to the decrease in sales to wholesalers 
the decrease in rebate reserve to  from  at june  is also due to the decrease in sales to wholesalers plus the decrease in overall sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal there was a large rebate reserve as of june  as direct customers those who receive the only rebates were a larger than usual portion of sales in the month of june  typically 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company began to implement improvements to separately calculate the chargebacks and reserves 
management is continuing to make improvements to the calculation and reconciliation of these amounts 
management performs several types of analysis to ensure reserves are reasonable 
this includes ratio analysis of wholesaler versus direct or retail sales mix  revenue reserve to gross sales  comparison of net receivables to net sales  comparison of gross receivables to gross sales and recalculation of wholesaler inventory levels 
the return and other reserves have decreased since june   due to an unusually high level of shelf stock adjustments required in the prior year 
changes in the competition in the primidone market required lannett to give more of this type of credit in the prior year 
fluctuations in the amount of sales through the wholesaler channel will have an impact on the amount of reserve being charged 
due to the fact that wholesale sales result in greater chargebacks  a change in wholesale sales will directly correlate to change in the chargebacks required 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reserves recorded against sales amounted to million  million  million and million  respectively 
wholesaler sales were million  million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the dollar value of the reserves corresponds to the increase in wholesale sales  most significantly in the fourth quarter 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reserves recorded against sales amounted to million  million  million and million  respectively 
wholesaler sales were million  million  million and million  respectively 
this third quarter increase in sales and reserves during fiscal is a result of increased demand for levothyroxine sodium  for which the reserve rebate and chargeback reserve remains consistent  but is higher than most other products 
this drug s reserves are higher than other drugs because of the number of competitors in the market 
this may change if the number of competitors decline because low prices will force some competitors out of the market  which in turn may lead to higher prices 
fourth quarter sales to wholesalers dropped off slightly from the third quarter 
the reserves in the fourth quarter also declined because of the product mix  but were consistent with reserves in the first and second quarters 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within both the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
the company also regularly monitors accounts receivable ar balances by reviewing both net and gross day s sales outstanding dso 
net dso is calculate by dividing gross accounts receivable less the reserve for rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments by the average daily net sales for the period 
gross dso shows the result of the same calculation without regard to rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments 
the company monitors both net dso and gross dso as an overall check on collections and to assess the reasonableness of the reserves 
gross dso provides management with an understanding of the frequency of customer payments  and the ability to process customer payments and deductions 
the net dso calculation provides management with an understanding of the relationship of the a r balance net of the reserve liability compared to net sales after charges to the reserves during the period 
standard payment terms offered to customers are consistent with industry practice at days 
net dso provides us with an understanding of the relationship of the a r balance net of the reserve liability compared to net sales after reserves charged during the period 
it eliminates the effect of timing of processing  which is inherent in the gross dso calculation 
the following table shows the results of these calculations for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  net dso in days gross dso in days the level of both net and gross dso at june  is consistent with the company s expectation that dso will be in the to day range  based on day payment terms for most customers inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market  regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand  and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements 
the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case it may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have recognized excess cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
new accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb issued fin  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements

the new standard is effective for our financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning july  we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp fas results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease reflected increased competition in the generic drug market which adversely affected lannett s sales of certain antibacterial drugs as well as sales of drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy 
prices of antibiotic drugs declined from prior year levels due to increased competition  which partly offset higher sales volumes 
prices of lannett s heart failure drugs increased slightly from prior year levels and sales volumes increased from the prior year level  largely due to the impact of a product recall of one of lannett s competitors during the quarter ended june  thyroid medication  our largest product in terms of sales  showed continued growth in both volume and in price 
the following table presents the percentage changes in prices and volumes for the company s products  by medical indication 
medical indication sales volume change sales price change migraine headache antibiotics epilepsy heart failure thyroid we plan to continue to increase the number of products available for sale to our customers  although fda approvals are needed to achieve this growth 
the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below presents the company s net sales to each category 
customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million retail chain million million mail order pharmacy million million private label million million total million million wholesaler distributor sales decreased as a result of one of lannett s major wholesalers withdrawing from the one stop program which used lannett as a first call supplier 
retail chain sales increased significantly as a result of an increase in the number of products available for sale and a significant increase in the number of retail stores of one of our customers 
mail order pharmacy sales decreased from the prior year due mainly to the market shift toward retail chains at the expense of mail order pharmacy sales 
private label sales increased slightly from the prior year  although this channel is not expected to contribute significantly to lannett s sales in the future as we have decided not to actively pursue additional private label customers because of the lower margins for this business 
in  prior to its acquisition by lannett  cody received an fda warning letter  and stopped operations to remediate their facility 
this remediation occurred from the months of august through february upon completion of the remediation  cody requested an fda inspection 
subsequent fda inspection resulted in relatively minor form observations  which have since been remediated 
in march cody labs recommenced manufacturing operations after management concluded that certain regulatory deficiencies identified by the fda prior to lannett s acquisition were substantially remediated 
cost of sales excluding amortization of intangible assets decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease reflected the decrease in net sales  partly offset by the impact of normal inflationary pressures on labor and material costs and expenses related to the company s prenatal vitamin with mineral product 
the amortization expense relates to the march  exclusive marketing and distribution rights agreement with jerome stevens pharmaceutical 
for the remaining six years of the contract  the company will incur annual amortization expense of approximately gross profit as a percent of net sales declined to in fiscal from in fiscal  due in part to expenses related to the prenatal multivitamin with mineral product  and price erosion for antibiotics  heart failure products and epilepsy medications 
while the company is continuously striving to keep product costs low  there can be no guarantee that profit margins will decline in future periods due to pricing pressure from competitors and costs of producing or purchasing new drugs 
changes in the product mix may also occur which also affect gross could profit as a percent of sales in future periods 
the company has changed the presentation of amortization of intangibles and product royalty expenses  in an effort to comply with the sec s staff accounting bulletin topic b sab b 
accordingly  amortization of intangible assets and product royalty expense is now presented before gross profit in order to align the financial reporting with this sec guidance  and prior periods have been reclassified on order to be consistent with the current presentation 
research and development r d expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the production of drugs in development and preparation for submission to the fda 
the company expenses all production costs as r d until the drug is approved by the fda 
r d expenses may fluctuate from period to period  based on planned submissions to the fda 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of general and administrative expenses of cody  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining increase in expense reflects increased legal expenses and higher professional fees 
while the company is focused on controlling costs  increases in personnel costs may have an ongoing impact on the administrative cost structure 
other costs are being incurred to facilitate improvements in the company s infrastructure 
on march   the company recorded an impairment charge of  on a note receivable owed by cody 
on april   it was decided to complete the acquisition of cody by forgiving the remaining balance of the receivable 
see discussion below in results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  reflecting full year impact of the interest expense on a mortgage held by cody realty llc 
effective with the acquisition of cody labs on april   the company consolidated the operations of lannett realty llc  a variable interest entity that had been fully consolidated by cody labs see note 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in fiscal on a pretax loss after minority interest of  as compared to tax expense of  in fiscal on a pretax loss of  the inclusion of state income taxes  federal income tax credits  and a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets were the principal reasons for the effective tax rate of in fiscal at june   the company has recognized a net deferred tax asset of  the net deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of  for the specific total tax asset of  related to the cody notes receivable impairment incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of cody labs and the  tax benefit associated with the state income tax net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has provided for the valuation allowance related to the notes receivable impairment as this benefit will be realized only upon the disposition of cody labs 
as the company has no current plans to dispose of its holdings in cody  a full valuation allowance has been established 
the valuation allowance related to the tax benefit of the state operating loss carryforwards has been established as the company does not expect these carryforwards to be utilized due to the company s tax planning strategies at the state and local levels 
the company expects the remaining net deferred tax assets to be fully realizable based on the company s history and future expectations of generating sufficient taxable income 
the company reported a net loss of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted loss per share  compared to net loss of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted loss per share 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due in part from continued improvement in sales of levothyroxine sodium levo  which increased million  or over the prior year sales  and sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim smz which increased million  a increase 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in other existing products  most significantly primidone tablets  of which sales declined  the company is working to offset continued declines in existing products through new product offerings 
the increase in levo sales was due entirely to an increase in the quantity of bottles sold 
the increase in smz was due to quantity increases of nearly and price increases of 
overall  product sales quantities increased including new products  leading to increased sales 
pricing pressure  due to increased competition and new customer demands for lower prices offset the volume increase  resulting in the sales increase over fiscal smz pricing benefited from the departure of a competitor from the market 
such pricing changes due to competition are not predictable 
for that reason  the company must maintain its focus on developing new products every year to expand the number of products available to supply to customers 
net sales of new products are often impacted by greater incentives to wholesalers 
excluding sales of smz in fiscal  the company experienced a decline in new product net sales in the year 
this is due to the company receiving fewer approvals from the fda during the year 
at june   the company had products  as anda and anda supplements  awaiting approval from the fda as compared to at june  the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below identifies the company s net sales to each category 
customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million retail chain million million mail order pharmacy million million private label million million total million million wholesaler distributor sales increased due to a rebound in levothyroxine sodium sales and sales of new products 
levo and smz sales increased as wholesalers began to reorder the product in larger volumes in fiscal retail chain sales increased significantly due to a new significant customer agreement signed during fiscal mail order pharmacy sales decreased slightly from the prior year 
private label sales decreased due to our largest private label customer  qualitest  receiving fda approval in late november to manufacture its own primidone mg 
as disclosed previously  private label sales have continued to decline  as lannett does not actively pursue additional private label customers because of the lower margins and product label inventories required to service the category 
cost of sales excluding amortization of intangible assets increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is due in part to higher production volumes to meet increased sales demand  and increased purchases of finished products for sale 
gross margins were in  a decline from in in spite of the significant increase in net sales  the company has increasing sales of drugs made by other companies  and distributed by lannett 
the margins on these drugs are typically lower than margins on produced drugs 
the company also launched a greater amount of new drugs in the prior year  and was able to take advantage of its new products and the higher margin on these products in depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
new drug approvals may increase in future years 
currently  there are products at the fda review stage 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development r d expenses decreased by  or 
the decrease in r d was primarily due to a decrease in raw material consumption for production of experimental batches 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or from the prior year 
a significant portion of the increase is due to expenses incurred in fiscal that relate to marketing agreements tied to sales of new generic products 
the amortization expense relates to the march  exclusive marketing and distribution rights agreement with jsp 
for the remaining seven years of the contract  the company will incur annual amortization expense of approximately  on march   the company wrote down  of a note receivable owed by cody laboratories  inc the company determined that the value of the note receivable was impaired  and on april   it was decided to complete the acquisition of cody by forgiving a portion of the loan 
at that point  cody owed lannett approximately million  in the form of notes receivable and prepayments on products and services 
the remaining value of the amounts owed  or million was approximately the net asset value of cody at the time of the acquisition 
the note was determined to be uncollectible due to fda reviews and operational delays by cody to return to operation 
in  cody received an fda warning letter  and stopped operations to remediate their facility 
this remediation occurred from the months of august through february upon completion of the remediation  cody requested a future fda inspection 
the timing of that inspection was  at that time  unknown  and cody management was unable to conclude as to the outcome of that inspection 
with such a limited outlook  cody management suggested that the full note was not likely to be satisfied  and lannett management was not willing to loan further funds to cody to keep it in operation 
both companies agreed to complete the acquisition for the value of the cody s net assets 
the uncollected portion of debt was extinguished prior to the acquisition 
upon acquisition  the fair value of cody s assets was added to the company s consolidated balance sheets  and the results of operations were included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date forward 
due to the fact that most of the value of cody consisted of physical assets that were recently acquired as part of the remediation  the fair value closely approximated the book value of net assets 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 business combinations  measurement is based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the asset or net assets acquired  whichever is more clearly evident and  thus  more reliably measurable 
the company s net loss for fiscal includes an income tax expense of  as compared to an expense of  in fiscal the company has set up a valuation allowance on the tax benefit from the write off of a portion of the cody loan described above in fiscal this has led to an income tax expense despite of the net loss from operations 
the company reported net loss of  for fiscal  or 
basic and diluted loss per share  compared to net income of  for fiscal  or 
basic and diluted earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations with cash flow generated from operations  supplemented with borrowings from various government agencies and financial institutions 
at june   working capital was  as compared to  at june   an increase of  net cash provided by operating activities of  for the fiscal year ended june  reflected cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities of  partly offset by a net loss of  after adjusting for non cash items of  significant changes in operating assets and liabilities are comprised of an increase in trade accounts receivable excluding the receivables related to the sales of prenatal multivitamins with minerals of  was due to a higher level of sales at the end of fiscal  compared to the end of fiscal a decrease in inventory of  due to higher than usual inventories at june  reflecting purchases from jerome stevens pharmaceutical in the quarter ended june  in response to strong demand for levothyroxine sodium  butalbital and digoxin products 
a decrease in prepaid taxes of  due to the application of an overpayment of taxes in fiscal to taxes owed in fiscal an increase in accounts payable of  is due to the timing of payments at the end of the month combined with increased spending on products for resale  primarily levothyroxine sodium tablets 
a decrease in accrued expenses of  was due to a high level of accrual for materials received at the end of fiscal primarily related to distributed products 
net cash used in investing activities of  for the twelve months ended june  reflected the purchase of property  plant and equipment of  partially offset by  of net proceeds related to the sale of the company s marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ending june  was  primarily due to scheduled debt repayments of  partially offset by  of proceeds from the issuance of stock in connection with the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  the company withheld the issuance of shares of stock with a fair value of  in connection with the payment of withholding taxes owed by certain employees for vested restricted stock 
during fiscal  the company issued restricted stock with a fair value of  to settle a liability for employee bonuses that had been earned during fiscal this represented a non cash transaction and is therefore not included on the consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal the company has entered into agreements with various government agencies and financial institutions to provide additional cash to help finance the company s operations 
these borrowing arrangements as of june  are as follows 
the company had a  million line of credit from wachovia bank  na that bears interest at the prime interest rate less at june  
the company had  available under this line of credit at june  the line of credit was renewed and extended to november  the company also entered into a letter of credit in the amount of  of which  is outstanding as of june  the company borrowed  from the philadelphia industrial development corporation pidc 
the company will pay a bi annual interest payment at a rate equal to two and one half percent per annum 
the outstanding principal balance shall be due and payable months from january  the company borrowed  through the pennsylvania industrial development authority pida 
the company is required to make equal payments each month for months starting february  with interest of two and three quarter percent per annum 
the pida loan has  outstanding as of june  with  currently due 
the company had borrowed  from the pennsylvania department of community and economic development machinery and equipment loan fund 
the company is required to make equal payments for months starting may  with interest of two and three quarter percent per annum 
as of june    is outstanding and  is currently due 
in april  the company entered into a loan agreement with the philadelphia authority for industrial development the authority or paid  to finance future construction and growth projects of the company 
the authority issued  in tax exempt variable rate demand and fixed rate revenue bonds to provide the funds to finance such growth projects pursuant to a trust indenture the trust indenture 
a portion of the company s proceeds from the bonds was used to pay for bond issuance costs of approximately  the trust indenture requires that the company repay the authority loan through installment payments beginning in may and continuing through may  the year the bonds mature 
the bonds bear interest at the floating variable rate determined by the organization responsible for selling the bonds the remarketing agent 
the interest rate fluctuates on a weekly basis 
the effective interest rate at june  was 
at june   the company has  outstanding on the authority loan  of which  is classified as currently due 
the remainder is classified as a long term liability 
in april  an irrevocable letter of credit of  was issued by wachovia bank  national association wachovia to secure payment of the authority loan and a portion of the related accrued interest 
at june   no portion of the letter of credit has been utilized 
the company entered into agreements the loan financing with wachovia to finance the purchase of the torresdale avenue facility  the renovation and setup of the building  and other anticipated capital expenditures 
the company  as part of the loan financing agreement  is required to make equal payments of principal and interest 
the only portion of the loan that remains outstanding at june  was the equipment loan which consists of a term loan with a term of five years and had an outstanding balance of  the terms of the equipment loan require that the company meet certain financial covenants and reporting standards  including the attainment of specific financial liquidity and net worth ratios 
as of june   the company was not in compliance with one of these covenants  but received a waiver from its lending institution with respect to that covenant as of june  the company shall maintain and comply with a debt service coverage ratio of not less than to to be measured quarterly 
debt service coverage is defined as the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to the sum of interest expenses plus scheduled current maturities of long term debt and current capitalized lease obligations 
the terms of the waiver require the company shall at all times maintain deposit balances in excess of  with the bank 
additionally  the company shall now pay to the bank an availability fee equal to per annum calculated daily  on the available but unused balance of the line of credit instead of the previous per annum rate 
the financing facilities under the loan financing bear interest at a variable rate equal to the libor rate plus basis points 
we believe that it is possible that we may not be able to comply with all of the covenants at each measurement date during the twelve month period ending june   therefore we reclassified the  long term portion of the debt to current portion of long term debt 
as of june   the interest rate for the loan financing of which only the equipment loan remains was 
the company has executed security agreements with wachovia  pida and pidc in which the company has agreed to use substantially all of its assets to collateralize the amounts due 
as part of the acquisition of cody laboratories  the company assumed the debt owed to the small business administration sba 
the loan requires fixed monthly payments through july  the effective interest rate at june  was 
as of june    is outstanding under the sba loan  of which  is classified as currently due

prospects for the future the company has several generic products under development 
these products are all orally administered  topical and parenteral products designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
as the oldest generic drug manufacturer in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  so as to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling it 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  or the raw material supplier of the previously approved anda 
a majority of the products in development represent either previously approved andas that the company is planning to reintroduce anda supplements  or new formulations new andas 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  and or clinical testing 
depending on the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the cost of the raw material  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies  the cost of such studies and other developmental factors  the cost to develop a new generic product varies and can range from  to million 
some of lannett s developmental products will require bioequivalence studies  while others will not depending on the fda s orange book classification 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping additional products 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
occasionally  the company will work on developing a drug product that does not require fda approval 
certain prescription drugs do not require prior fda approval before marketing 
for instance  drugs listed as desi drugs drug efficacy study implementation which are under evaluation by fda  grandfathered drugs  and prescription multivitamin drugs 
a generic manufacturer may sell products which are chemically equivalent to innovator drugs  under fda rules by simply performing and internally documenting the normal research and development involved in bringing a new product to market 
under this scenario  a generic company can forego the time required for fda anda approval 
more specifically  certain products  marketed prior to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca may be considered grase or grandfathered 
grase products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from fda in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature 
similarly  grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the act or the amendments to the act 
under the grandfather clause  such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements 
of the act 
if its composition and labeling have not changed since and if  on the day before the amendments became effective  it was used or sold commercially in the united states  not a new drug as defined by the act at that time  and not covered by an effective application 
the company signed supply and development agreements with olive healthcare  of india  orion pharma  of finland  azad pharma ag  of switzerland  unichem inc of india  wintac limited of india  pharmaseed of israel and banner pharmacaps and catalent of the united states  and is in negotiations with companies in israel and china for similar new product initiatives  in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by lannett or by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development and manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
lannett may increase its focus on certain specialty markets in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
such a focus is intended to provide lannett customers with increased product alternatives in categories with relatively few market participants 
while there is no guarantee that lannett has the market expertise or financial resources necessary to succeed in such a market specialty  management is confident that such future focus will be well received by lannett customers and increase shareholder value in the long run 
the company plans to enhance relationships with strategic business partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as finished goods 
management believes that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could allow for potential competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
the company plans to continue to explore such areas for potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value 
as disclosed in item legal proceedings  the company filed in june a declaratory judgment suit against kv pharmaceuticals  drugtech corp  and ther rx corp collectively kv 
the complaint sought declaratory judgment for non infringement and invalidity of certain patents owned by kv 
the complaint further sought declaratory judgment of anti trust violations and federal and state unfair competition violations for actions taken by kv in securing and enforcing these patents 
if kv were to prevail in the litigation and the company were subject to paying damages or were prohibited from selling the prenatal multivitamin in the future  it could have an adverse impact on the company 
any requirement to pay damages could adversely impact the company s cash flow and results of operations
