in addition  certain statements in this report  and in particular  statements found in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we believe these forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of ennis 
all such statements involve risks and uncertainties  and as a result  actual results could differ materially from those projected  anticipated  or implied by these statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  including but not limited to  general economic  business and labor conditions  the ability to implement our strategic initiatives  the ability to be profitable on a consistent basis  dependence on 
table of contents sales that are not subject to long term contracts  dependence on suppliers  the ability to recover the rising cost of key raw materials in markets that are highly price competitive  the ability to meet customer demand for additional value added products and services  the ability to timely or adequately respond to technological changes in the industry  the impact of the internet and other electronic media on the demand for forms and printed materials  postage rates  the ability to manage operating expenses  the ability to manage financing costs and interest rate risk  a decline in business volume and profitability could result in an impairment of goodwill  the ability to retain key management personnel  the ability to identify  manage or integrate future acquisitions  the costs associated with and the outcome of outstanding and future litigation  and changes in government regulations 
in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements may prove to be inaccurate and speak only as of the date when made

results of operations consolidated fiscal years ended statements of earnings data net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative gain from disposal of assets income from operations other expense  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosures and reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  pension plan  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their affect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
amounts allocated to intangibles are determined based on independent valuations for our acquisitions and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we evaluate these amounts periodically at least once a year to determine whether the value has been impaired by events occurring during the fiscal year 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets that include other intangible assets  goodwill  and property  plant  and equipment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing tests of impairment  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles 
if these 
table of contents estimates or the related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future 
actual results could differ from assumptions made by management 
we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns and other allowances 
returns  discounts and other allowances have historically been insignificant 
in some cases and upon customer request  we print and store custom print product for customer specified future delivery  generally within twelve months 
in this case  risk of loss from obsolescence passes to the customer  the customer is invoiced under normal credit terms and revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete 
approximately million  million  and million of revenue were recognized under these agreements during fiscal years ended february   february   and february  respectively 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors  and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  current economic environment  discussions with our project managers  and discussions with the customers directly 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand  using specific aging categories  and write down inventory deemed obsolete and or slow moving based on historical usage and estimated future usage to its estimated market value 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
in addition to the above  we also have to make assessments as to the adequacy of our accrued liabilities  more specifically our liabilities recorded in connection with our workers compensation and health insurance  as these plans are self funded 
to help us in this evaluation process  we routinely get outside third party assessments of our potential liabilities under each plan 
in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise

on a dollar and percentage basis  these expenses increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions and the increase in our miscellaneous expenses  which was attributable to a significant increase in our credit card fees due to increased usage of credit purchase cards by our customers 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year on a dollar and percentage basis  these expenses increased primarily as a result of the print segment acquisitions of block  spf  and full year expenses associated with the acquisition of tbf

the increase in our operational earnings  on a dollar basis  during fiscal year related primarily to the increase in sales due to our acquisitions of trade and b d in fiscal year and full year revenue associated with our fiscal year acquisition of block 
the slight decrease in our operational earnings  as a percentage of sales  related primarily to the increase of selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year as previously discussed

other income and expense our interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively

the print segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our net sales for the print segment were approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the print segment s net sales for the fiscal year related primarily to our acquisition of b d and trade which were acquired october  and september   respectively and the full year impact of our acquisition of block which was acquired on august  net sales for the acquired entities were million for the fiscal year ended compared to million for the fiscal year ended the impact of the increase in sales from our acquired entities was offset by the planned attrition of low margin print sales and the decline in our commercial print operations over comparable periods last year due to the impact of the loss of two large promotional customers 
while this impacted our sales during the current fiscal year by approximately million  we feel the impact associated with these accounts has matured as the sales in our commercial print operations during the last six months has been above comparable sales levels last year 
due to the contracting nature of the print industry  our traditional print plants saw their sales decline by approximately million  or during the current fiscal year 
our net sales for the print segment were approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the print segment s net sales for the fiscal year was primarily due to our acquisitions of spf  tbf  and block which added approximately million to our print sales during fiscal year this increase was offset by the exit of two large customers  which we ceased doing business with during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and second quarter of fiscal year  respectively 
this loss amounted to approximately million in lost revenues for fiscal year the decision to cease doing business with these large customers impacted our top line revenue in the short term  however  given the gross profit margins afforded by these customers  this business decision was beneficial to our gross profit 
in addition  due to the contracting nature of the print industry  our traditional print plants saw their sales decline by million or during the fiscal year apparel segment 
the apparel segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and respectively 

table of contents for fiscal year  our apparel segment net sales were approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the apparel segment s net sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
management believes that the apparel sales during fiscal year were negatively impacted during the first six months by lower inventory levels at the beginning of the fiscal year  which hindered the apparel segment s ability to capture certain opportunity sales during this period 
traditionally  the apparel segment rebuilds its inventory levels in the last half of the fiscal year for the upcoming summer buying season due to the normal falloff of demand during the winter season 
however  during the second half of last fiscal year demand was at or above forecasted sales levels 
as a result  production levels were only able to stay abreast of then current sales levels  which resulted in inventory levels not being as robust in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as during the same period last fiscal year 
consequently  several initiatives were implemented during the first and second quarters of this fiscal year to improve the apparel segment s inventory levels and to meet forecasted demand 
significant progress was made on these initiatives during the second and third quarters of this fiscal year and the apparel segment s inventory levels during the third quarter were significantly improved  which management believes allowed the apparel sales to return to more normalized sales growth levels during the third and fourth quarters during the third quarter and during the fourth quarter 
our fiscal year net sales for the apparel segment was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the apparel segment s net sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with new customers  which is attributable to our market penetration pricing strategies deployed during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal years ended gross profit by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
our print segment s gross profit increased approximately million  or for fiscal year compared to million  or for fiscal year the increase in gross profit  on a dollar basis relates primarily to our increased sales volume as previously discussed 
as a percentage of sales  our gross profit was   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our print margin  as a percentage of sales  increased primarily as a result of improved operational efficiencies and planned attrition of low margin sales 
our gross profit during fiscal year was impacted by the decrease in margins at our adams mcclure facility  which related primarily to operational performance issues encountered in executing several large promotional contracts 
this conversely had a positive impact on our margins during fiscal year when we exited these contracts in the later half of fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year apparel segment 
our apparel segment s gross profit decreased approximately million  or for fiscal year and increased approximately million or for fiscal year as a percentage of sales  our gross profit was   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our apparel margins during the year were impacted mainly by the increased costs associated with our apparel inventory build  and to a lesser extent by higher cotton prices during our fourth quarter and lower selling prices on certain products due to competitive pressures 
during the first nine months of the year and in connection with our inventory build initiative  we incurred approximately million in additional overtime charges  million in additional temporary labor charges and million in additional cut sew costs  all of which had a negative impact on our reported margins for further discussion on the increased cut sew costs and changes made  reference is made to our form q filed for the first  second and third quarters of this fiscal year with the securities and exchange commission 
during the fourth quarter  we saw cotton prices increase significantly  and while we increased selling prices during this period to offset a portion of this cost increase  our margins were negatively impacted 
our apparel segment s gross profit  as a percentage of sales  decreased during fiscal year due to raw material cost increases and the inability to pass these increased costs through to the marketplace  lower absorption of 
table of contents fixed manufacturing costs due to lower manufacturing levels and market penetration pricing strategies employed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year which drove higher sales 
in addition  our margins during the fiscal year were impacted by a lower manufacturing absorption factor as we reduced our apparel inventory levels during the year by over million 
while the aforementioned factors had a negative impact on our apparel margins in  they in turn had a positive impact on our apparel margins in fiscal years ended profit by segment in thousands print apparel total less corporate expenses earnings before income taxes print segment 
our print segment s profit for fiscal year increased by approximately million  or  from million for the fiscal year  to million for the fiscal year ended february  and increased approximately million  or for fiscal year  from million in fiscal year primarily as a result of our acquisitions 
as a percent of sales  this segment s profits were   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in our print profit  as a percent of sales is related to the increase in our sales and our gross profit margin  as previously discussed 
this segment s profits during fiscal year  as discussed previously  was impacted by operational performance issues encountered by our adams mcclure plant in executing several large contracts 
we exited these contracts during the later part of fiscal year and the first part of fiscal year  which as indicated above had a positive impact of this segment s operational margins and profits during the current fiscal year 
apparel segment 
our apparel profit decreased approximately million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended february   to million for the fiscal year ended february  primarily due to the decrease in gross margins as previously discussed 
our apparel segment s profit increased approximately million  or for fiscal year primarily due to increased sales 
as a percent of sales  this segment s profits were   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
during the fiscal year  while this segment s gross margins were down slightly due to the factors previously mentioned  we were able to successfully leverage increased sales volume to bring increased profits to our bottom line 
we were unable to do this during the current fiscal year due to the factors discussed above see discussion on apparel segment net sales which hindered our annual growth this year 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in thousands change working capital cash and cash equivalents working capital 
our working capital increased by approximately million  or from million at february  to million at february  the increase in our working capital during the period related primarily to an increase in our receivables and inventories 
the increase in our receivables related primarily to the phasing out of alstyle s factoring arrangement 
the increase in our inventory levels related primarily to our acquisitions during the period and our planned increase in alstyle s inventory level 
our current ratio  calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities increased from to at february  to to at february  cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consists of highly liquid investments  such as time deposits held at major banks  commercial paper  united states government agency discount notes  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of days or less 
we used cash during the period to pay down our debt  finance the phase out of alstyle s factoring arrangements  build our apparel inventory  and to acquire certain businesses

cash provided by our operating activities decreased by million  or to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year during the fiscal year  approximately of our apparel credit sales were factored compared to for the fiscal year as a result  approximately million of operational cash during the period was used to fund the transition of these previously factored sales to in house credit see credit facility following for further discussion 
in addition  we used operational cash during the period to increase our apparel inventory levels by approximately million  see results of operations segments for further discussion 
we were able to offset these uses of our operational cash during the period by increased management of our print inventory levels  accounts receivable and payables 
while both the aforementioned apparel initiatives required the use of a significant amount of our operational cash during the period  approximately million  we view both as one time uses of cash and as such neither would be expected to have a significant impact on our operational cash flow for fiscal year cash flows from investing activities 
cash used for our investing activities decreased by million  or to million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year during the fiscal year  we acquired two businesses  b d and trade for million 
during the fiscal year  we acquired two businesses  specialized printed forms and block graphics for million 
our capital expenditures for each of the last years have been relatively consistent 
in addition to the above  we generated cash during the past years by selling some of our unused or under utilized property  plant and equipment

the facility contains financial covenants  restrictions on capital expenditures  acquisitions  asset dispositions  and additional debt  as well as other customary covenants 
as of february   we had million of borrowings under the revolving credit line and million outstanding under standby letters of credit arrangements  leaving us availability of approximately million 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our personal and investment property 
during fiscal year  we repaid million on the revolver and million on other debt and borrowed million  mainly for acquisitions and the phase out of the apparel s factoring arrangements 
it is anticipated that the available line of credit is sufficient to cover  should it be required  working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
alstyle continues to sell a portion of its accounts receivable to factors fiscal year  fiscal year  last fiscal quarter based upon agreements in place with these factors 
as previously discussed  due to potential cost savings  we are continuing with our initiative to reduce the amount of receivables we factor each year through the utilization of our existing bank line or from working capital generated by our apparel segment 
while this initiative did require the use of a substantial amount of our operational cash during the period  we do not anticipate that the final phase out of this program  which will occur during fiscal year  will have a significant impact on our operational cash during the year
