income taxes the american jobs creation act of instituted an elective tonnage tax regime whereby a corporation may elect to pay a tonnage tax based upon the net tonnage of its qualifying us flag vessels rather than the traditional us corporate income tax on the taxable income from such vessels and related inland service 
the company has determined that its marine operations and inland transportation related to marine operations qualify for the tonnage tax 
in the second quarter of  the company completed its analysis of the impact of making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime 
the analysis illustrated that using the tonnage tax method would reduce the company s cash outlay related to federal income taxes  for federal tax purposes  the company can satisfy only of its amt alternative minimum taxable income with its net operating loss carryforwards nol and  therefore  results in a much larger cash outlay in comparison to the required payments associated with the tonnage tax regime 
as a result of this analysis  the company determined that it will be making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime on its federal tax return 
the federal tax expense related to under the tonnage tax method is estimated to be approximately  which cannot be offset by the company s existing nol s because when the company elects to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime its federal nol s related to qualifying shipping activities will not be available to offset any related tonnage tax 
as a result  it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize its deferred tax asset 
therefore during the second quarter of  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was adjusted by approximately million to reflect this limitation 
the remaining deferred tax asset of approximately  represents the state portion of the company s deferred tax asset 
the company s research of the tonnage tax suggests that states do not recognize the tonnage tax and  therefore  nol s related to state qualifying shipping income would not be suspended

table of contents reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process  voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
demurrage and charterhire revenue are included in our revenues 
net demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time less a demurrage related allowance for bad debt 
charter hire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service 
the company recognizes demurrage and charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our customers 
these amounts are computed daily and included in operating revenue 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating our property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
repairs and maintenance 
the company expenses repairs and maintenance as incurred 
every five years the company s vessels are required to go through regulatory dry docking 
the company elected  in a prior year  to account for its dry docking costs using the expense as incurred method as opposed to the defer and amortize method predominantly used by the company s industry peer group 
the company elected the expense as incurred method for accounting for these required regulatory dry docking costs as it is the method preferred by the securities and exchange commission 
using the expense as incurred method  the company recorded   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
had the company used the defer and amortize method such expenses would have been amortized over the five year period between regulatory dry dockings 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to our carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of appraisals or other valuation techniques 
the company recognized no impairments in  or uncollectible accounts 
the company records a monthly provision based on specific known collectibility problems  historical losses  and current economic information 
in addition  the company performs an analysis of the total receivables on a quarterly basis  including review of historical collection page 
table of contents trends  and adjusts the provision account each quarter 
it is the company s policy to write off receivables once it is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the collection of the receivable

revised  business combinations 
this standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
this standard also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this standard improves the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
under the new standard  noncontrolling interests are to be treated as a separate component of stockholders equity  not as a liability or other item outside of stockholders equity 
this standard also requires that increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership be accounted for as equity transactions

sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
united states generally accepted accounting principles has required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas on its financial condition and results of operations and does not believe that it will have a material impact on the company s financial statements
