item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we offer customized flexible printed circuit applications and services ranging from design and application engineering  prototyping and high volume manufacturing to turnkey component assembly and testing 
we target our solutions within the electronics market and  in particular  we focus on applications where flexible printed circuits facilitate human interaction with an electronic device and are the enabling technology in achieving a desired size  shape  weight or functionality of the device 
current applications for our products include mobile phones and smart mobile devices  portable bar code scanners  personal digital assistants  power supplies and consumable medical sensors 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed mfc  a wholly owned chinese subsidiary to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our products 
mfc provides a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and multi layer flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
in fiscal  we formed mfc  a second wholly owned subsidiary in china to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity 
in fiscal  we leased a manufacturing facility in pontian  malaysia for flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity and to broaden our geographic base 
in addition  in fiscal  we leased office space in singapore for our asia pacific regional office 
in fiscal  we acquired the assets of applied optics  inc  a company which designed and manufactured optical and photonic imaging solutions  and operate this business as aurora optical  inc  a subsidiary of mflex aurora optical 
in july  we began implementing a plan to close the tucson  arizona facility of aurora optical to consolidate the research and development and other design activities into our corporate headquarters in anaheim  california  and to complete the transfer of the subsidiary s product manufacturing activities to our china subsidiary 
the closure is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year we plan to sell or dispose of certain of the related assets  which consist mainly of a company owned building and manufacturing equipment  before the end of their expected useful life  and transfer certain pieces of manufacturing equipment  which can be modified to other uses  to our anaheim facility at their carrying value 
based on this  we completed an impairment analysis under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  determined that certain of the assets were impaired  and recorded a pre tax charge of million during the fourth quarter of additionally  under the guidance of sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  a pre tax restructuring charge composed of severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure was estimated at  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with the remainder of  expected to be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal going forward  we believe that we can achieve approximately million dollars per year in cost savings 

table of contents net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
we engage the services of eight non exclusive sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
seven of these sales representatives are located throughout the united states and we also have one sales representative in korea 
the variety of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are to customers outside of the united states 
sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes and delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our anaheim  california and tucson  arizona facilities are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or chinese renminbi for sales made in china 
during fiscal year  our net sales were impacted by a shift in our customer base 
although net sales to our historically largest customer decreased from of net sales in fiscal year to of net sales in fiscal year  our net sales to all other customers grew in total by million  or nearly  in fiscal year as compared to this growth was driven primarily by increases in net sales during fiscal year to our three other key customers 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs include all materials and facilities associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost represents the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product and includes stock based compensation expense related to such personnel 
purchased process services relate to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements 
during fiscal year  we experienced improved gross margins  primarily due to improved yields on high volume production programs and the leveraging of fixed overhead expenses on the higher net sales 
research and development research and development costs are incurred in the development of new products and processes  including significant improvements and refinements to existing products and are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related costs associated with our sales and marketing  business development and engineering support groups and expenses for overseas sales support  trade show and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and benefits of administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel and other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment and other corporate office expenses 

table of contents impairment and restructuring expense asset impairment expense is the difference between the fair market value  based on the estimated future cash flows of the under lying assets  and the carrying value  or net book value  of the assets 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the underlying assets 
restructuring expense represents severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure or disposal of a business unit or location 
interest income interest income consists of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents balances and long term investments 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense incurred on our lines of credit 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists primarily of the loss on our auction rate securities investments and gain or loss on foreign currency exchange 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues  which we refer to as net sales  are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
an ems provider may or may not be an oem subcontractor 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that states a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectability of the related account receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
we report revenues net of an allowance for returns  refunds and credits  which we estimate based on historical experience 

table of contents inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand  therefore  our estimates of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may change  which we will record in the period such determination was made 
investments 
we value our investments at fair value 
we regularly review our investments and record appropriate charges when the recoverable value is less than it related carrying value 
the company s investments consist primarily of auction rate securities backed by student loans 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow method to determine the related investments fair value 
market variables utilized in developing the valuation model for these securities include relative yields on federal student loan securities  average day t bill rates  day libor rates  interest rate spreads as determined by the changing credit market environment and quality of market credit and liquidity the risks and uncertainties include changes in the credit quality of the securities  changes in liquidity as a result of normal market mechanisms or issuer calls of the securities  and the effects of changes in interest rates 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of any valuation allowance  we have considered taxable income in prior carry back years  future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
in addition  we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible amounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the majority of our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers  therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves 
we provide a two to thirty six month warranty on our products 
we provide a warranty reserve for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the net sales are recognized 
while we engage in quality programs and processes  up to and including the final product  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of the failed product and the inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing defective parts 
we continuously monitor and analyze product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of replacement vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
long lived asset impairment 
we test for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of long lived assets under the guidance of sfas the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as 
table of contents determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considered information supplied by management and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  there is no impairment 
on september   management completed impairment testing of the long lived assets of aurora optical and determined that the long lived assets were impaired 
restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges related to plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities 
in connection with these activities  we record restructuring charges for employee termination and relocation costs and other exit related costs 
the recognition of restructuring charges under the guidance of sfas requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent that actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
in conjunction with the planned closure of aurora optical  we estimated the restructuring costs that would result from the closure 
those costs include  but are not limited to  a termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract  b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and c costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
based on our analysis  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge composed of severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure of aurora optical in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and will recorded a similar charge in the first quarter of fiscal goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during july of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the 
table of contents amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
to date  we have had no impairments of goodwill 
stock based compensation 
in first quarter of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas r 
in accordance with sfas r  in our first quarter of fiscal year  we started to recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  adjusted for an estimated future forfeiture rate  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we utilize the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering on june  our ipo and the minimum value method for stock options granted prior to our ipo 
generally  our calculation of the fair value for options granted under sfas r is similar to the calculation of fair value under sfas with the exception of the treatment of forfeitures 
expected forfeitures of stock options are estimated based on the historical turnover of our employees 
prior to sfas r  we recognized forfeitures under sfas as they occurred 
the fair value of restricted stock units granted is based on the grant date price of our common stock 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including a the expected volatility of our common stock price  which we determine based on historical volatility of our common stock since the date of our ipo  b expected dividends  which are zero  as we do not currently anticipate issuing dividends  c expected life of the stock option  which is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise behavior of our employees  and d risk free interest rate is based on observed interest rates zero coupon us treasury debt securities appropriate for the expected holding period 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense asset impairment and restructuring costs terminated acquisition expenses operating income loss interest income  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal driven primarily by increased net sales to customers within our wireless sector  which increased million and comprised of net sales in fiscal versus during fiscal the increase in wireless net sales was largely due to the ramp up of new programs and unit volume shipment increases to three customers offset by declines in unit volume shipments to a fourth customer 
due to the success of our customer diversification efforts  sales to our four largest customers represented   and of total sales for fiscal year as compared to of sales to one customer in fiscal we believe that this expanded wireless customer base will provide an increased opportunity for top line revenue growth in fiscal net sales to the consumer products sector increased or million to million versus million in fiscal as a result of new program wins and unit volume increases 
we believe that unit volume increases on new consumer product programs will contribute to further revenue growth in this sector in fiscal net sales to the industrial sector  our third largest sector  decreased or million to million for the year ended september  versus million in the prior fiscal year mainly due to continued unit volume declines 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was driven by several factors 
the main driver was favorable customer mix changes  followed by cost leveraging from improved factory utilization and improved manufacturing yields 
in the previous fiscal year  manufacturing yields were negatively impacted by the substantially larger number of new high volume program ramp ups that occurred during that time 
this along with significant increases in overhead spending driven by the million mfc capacity expansion that was on going throughout the second half of fiscal resulted in increased cost of sales  due to the leveraging of fixed overhead expenses 
gross profit increased to million in the year ended september  versus million in the prior year  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit is primarily due to a favorable customer mix change followed by improved plant utilization which leveraged our cost structure and improved manufacturing yields in the current fiscal year 
we expect quarterly gross margins to return to the to range in the first half of fiscal gross profits in the prior fiscal year were adversely impacted by the cost of sales increases stated above 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses remained relatively unchanged at million for the years ended september  and we expect these expenses to grow as we continue to focus on additional new technologies  primarily those which will provide for additional miniaturization and cost reduction of our products  and also allow us to further differentiate ourselves from our competition 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
sales representative commissions and other sales related expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in commission expense related to the higher increased net sales on relatively stable average commission rates as well as a  increase in customer support expenses primarily related to our netherlands sales office and our new asian regional office in singapore 
compensation and benefit expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  compensation and benefit expense for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal  primarily due to the leveraging of expense over the higher net sales volumes 
we expect sales and marketing expense  as a percentage of net sales  to remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year 
general and administrative expense 
the million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to a million increase in compensation and benefits related to headcount increases in the us  china and singapore  increased professional fees of million  increased depreciation expense of  and increased information systems infrastructure costs of  offset by a decrease of million  primarily related to a reduction in litigation expenses incurred in the prior year related to the terminated offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of mfs technology ltd 
the mfs offer 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the leveraging of expense on the higher net sales 
we expect general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  to remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year 
asset impairment and restructuring cost 
during the fiscal year ended we recorded an asset impairment and restructuring charge of million related to the restructuring of our wholly owned subsidiary  aurora optical in tucson  arizona 
no charges were recorded during the prior fiscal year 
going forward  we believe that we can achieve approximately to million dollars per year in cost savings 
terminated acquisition costs 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded a million non recurring charge to write off deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the mfs offer 
no charges were recorded during the current fiscal year 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to additional cash balances available for investment 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease is attributable to reduced borrowings on our lines of credit during fiscal other income expense  net 
net other income expense changed to an expense of million for the year ended september  from income of  for the prior year 
the change is primarily due to a million loss on foreign exchange in the current fiscal year versus a gain from foreign exchange of  during the prior year and a million charge related to the impairment of our long term investments in auction rate securities 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  due to a worsening of the economic and credit markets and significant changes in interest rates for short term treasury bills  we determined that the impairment in value of our auction rate securities was other than temporary and therefore we recorded the charge against net income 
the increase in loss on foreign exchange was due to the significant devaluation of the us dollar against the chinese rmb  japanese yen  and other major foreign currencies 

table of contents income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was a provision of  compared to a benefit of for fiscal the higher effective tax provision was primarily due to increased income generated in the us  a higher tax jurisdiction 
the company recorded additional tax expense of million as a result of international reorganization efforts and the transition of technology to further strengthen the company s asian operations 
in addition to enhancing operational efficiencies  this action is expected to reduce the company s future effective tax rate 
the higher effective tax benefit in the prior fiscal year was mainly due to foreign tax credits offsetting us taxes  the tax benefit of losses generated in the us  a higher tax jurisdiction  and income generated in china  a lower tax jurisdiction 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
the essentially flat net sales of million in fiscal versus million in fiscal were primarily attributable to significant offsetting fluctuations in net sales to customers within our wireless sector  which comprised of net sales in fiscal versus during fiscal while net sales to our largest customer decreased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal year due to price reductions and substantially reduced sales volume as a result of increased competition and softer demand from this customer  net sales to our second largest customer increased million  or  during fiscal year due to the continuation of high volume orders on programs which were initiated at the end of fiscal as well as the ramping up of several new programs during fiscal year sales to our largest customer  which represented of our net sales in fiscal  decreased to of our net sales in fiscal year due to the declines mentioned above as well as the success of our customer diversification efforts  which resulted in our second largest customer increasing from a concentration of of our net sales in fiscal to in fiscal net sales to the industrial sector  our second largest sector  decreased or million to million for the year ended september  versus million in fiscal year mainly due to the continued decline in demand 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was driven by several factors 
the main driver was manufacturing yield decreases  which comprised approximately of the increase 
manufacturing yields were negatively impacted by the substantially larger number of new high volume program ramp ups that occurred during fiscal versus fiscal yield improvements were achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the stabilization of these new programs 
increased overhead spending driven by a increase in sales volumes drove approximately of the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in overhead spending was primarily driven by the million mfc capacity expansion that was on going throughout the second half of fiscal and resulted in some de leveraging of fixed overhead expenses during fiscal year in anticipation of higher sales volumes in the latter portion of fiscal and throughout fiscal these sales volume increases were beginning to be realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to customer price reductions which were initiated early in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in the year ended september  versus million in fiscal  a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for fiscal year from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the price reductions on our products and decreased manufacturing yields  as compared to fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
the increase is primarily due to our increasing focus on new technologies  primarily lens applications and low profile camera modules  as well as increased research and development activities at our anaheim location 

table of contents sales and marketing expense 
sales representatives commissions and other sales related expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in commission expense related to the higher commission rates on new programs as well as a  increase in customer support expenses related to the expansion of our international sales offices  particularly our netherlands sales office 
compensation and benefit expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  compensation and benefit expense for fiscal increased to from in fiscal  primarily due to the increased engineering headcount in china to support a number of new program ramp ups during fiscal general and administrative expense 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the million increase in litigation expenses related to termination of the mfs offer which were expensed as incurred during the year ended september  head count increases in china related to the planned expansion of the manufacturing capacity of mfc in china also generated approximately  in additional administrative expense during fiscal terminated acquisition costs 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded a million non recurring charge to write off deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the mfs offer 
no charges were recorded during fiscal interest income 
interest income remained constant at million for fiscal and interest expense 
interest expense increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is attributable to a higher average balance of million carried on our lines of credit during the fiscal versus an average balance of million carried during fiscal other income expense  net 
net other income expense changed to income of  for the year ended september  from expense of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to a  increase in gain on foreign exchange 
we experienced a loss from foreign exchange of  during the year ended september  versus a gain of  during the year ended september  the increase in gain on foreign exchange is due to gains experienced on mfc purchases made in us dollars and recorded in rmb  mfc s functional currency 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of compared to a provision of for fiscal the higher effective tax benefit was mainly due to foreign tax credits offsetting us taxes  the tax benefit of losses generated in the us  a higher tax jurisdiction  and income generated in china  a lower tax jurisdiction 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  equity offerings and borrowings under our various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance working capital  facility expansions and other capital expenditures 
we anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
global financial and credit markets recently have been  and continue to be  extremely unstable and unpredictable 
worldwide economic conditions have been weak and may be further deteriorating 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness in the financial and credit markets could affect our ability to sell our investment securities and other financial assets  which in turn could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position 
this instability also could affect the prices at which we could make any such sales  which could also adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
these conditions could also negatively affect our ability to secure funds or raise capital  if needed 
it is our policy to carefully monitor the state of our business  cash requirements and capital structure 
we believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth over at least the next twelve months 
we also 
table of contents believe we will have sufficient capital to fund our operations without the need to derive cash from the sale of our auction rate securities  however  there can be no assurance that any growth will occur and unexpected events may result in our need to raise additional capital 
the valuation of the company s investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  market interest rates  discount rates and ongoing strength 
market variables utilized in developing the valuation model for these securities include relative yields on federal student loan securities  average day t bill rates  day libor rates  interest rate spreads as determined by the changing credit market environment and quality of market credit and liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under our loan agreements with shanghai pudong development bank or bank of china 
the amounts outstanding under these loan agreements at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition based on our current borrowing level 
foreign currency risk we derive a substantial portion of our sales outside of the united states 
approximately million  or  of total shipments to these foreign manufacturers for fiscal were made in us dollars 
the balance of our net sales is denominated in rmb 
the exchange rate for the rmb to the us dollar has been an average of rmb per us dollar for the fiscal year ended september  transactions in rmb represent approximately of total net sales from foreign customers for the fiscal year ended september  in july  the people s bank of china pboc terminated the fixed exchange rate between the rmb and the us dollar  adjusted the exchange rate from to and established a maximum daily appreciation against the us dollar 
however  during the third quarter of fiscal  the pboc increased the rate at which the rmb us dollar exchange can fluctuate  which resulted in a greater rmb appreciation 
we anticipate the rmb appreciation against the us dollar to continue to increase in the future  which will result in an increase in the cost of our business expenses in china due to the movement of the exchange rates 
we generally do not consider it necessary to hedge against currency risk  as a significant portion of our material cost of sales is denominated in us dollars  eliminating much of the need to hedge  however  we continue to be vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
liquidity risk as a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  during auctions for investment in auction rate securities held by us failed 
an auction fails when there is insufficient demand 
however  a failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer 
the auction rate securities continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the underlying security  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these investments develop 
however  due to the current absence of a liquid market  we have reclassified our investments in auction rate securities from current assets to non current assets in our consolidated condensed balance sheet 
when liquidity for these types of investments returns in the market  we intend to sell these investments or reclassify them back to current assets 
we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to auction rate securities will have an impact on our ability to fund operations 
all of our auction rate securities are rated aaa aaa  are collateralized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the us government and continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual terms 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
as of september   the fair value of our auction rate securities of million was determined using a model that calculates the present value of the expected future cash flows from our securities and other indications of value  and as a consequence of our belief that the impairment is of an other than temporary nature  we have recorded a charge of million in our results of operations for the period ended september
