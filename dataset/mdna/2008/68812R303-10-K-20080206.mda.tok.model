research and development programs factive as a condition to the approval to sell factive tablets  the fda required  as a post marketing study commitment  that we conduct a prospective  randomized study examining the activity of factive tablets  patients versus an active comparator  patients in patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity 
this study included patients of different ethnicities to gain safety information in populations not substantially represented in the existing clinical trial program 
this phase iv trial was initiated in the fall of was completed in january the final report of the utilization study is scheduled for submission to the fda in the first half of in the future  we need only to provide the fda with annual reports containing safety information 
additionally  in april  we completed a phase iii trial examining the potential use of factive tablets for the five day treatment of mild to moderate cap

critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is the sale of antara capsules and factive tablets 
in the second quarter of  we began recognizing co promotion revenue in connection with our co promotion agreement with auxilium pharmaceuticals  inc auxilium  which terminated on august  other historical sources of revenue include biopharmaceutical alliances and royalties from our divested genomic services business 
in future periods  product revenues will continue to increase based on anticipated increased volume of prescriptions of antara capsules and factive tablets 
conversely  we expect our revenues derived from biopharmaceutical alliances will continue to decrease 
although antara revenue results are anticipated to be steady throughout our fiscal year  we expect demand for factive to be highest from december to march as the incidence of respiratory tract infections  including cap and aecb  tends to increase during the winter months 
in addition  fluctuations in the severity of the annual respiratory tract infection season may cause our product sales to vary from year to year 
due to these seasonal fluctuations in demand for factive  our results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the entire year 
product sales we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab sab no 
and recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  rebates  special promotional programs  and discounts 
for arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed to wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed 
the cost of antara and factive associated with amounts recorded as deferred revenue is recorded in inventory until such time as risk of loss has passed 
other revenues other revenues primarily consist of sublicensing revenues related to factive 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

in accordance with eitf no 
 the up front license payments related to the various sublicense agreements will be recognized as revenue over the term of our continuing obligations under the arrangements which range from eighteen months to thirty three months 
substantive milestones achieved are recognized as revenue when earned and when payment is reasonably assured  if we have completed our remaining obligations under the arrangement 
if we have further obligations  milestone payments are recognized as revenue if we have sufficient evidence of fair value for its remaining obligations otherwise the milestone payment is recognized as revenue over the remaining performance period 
we expense incremental direct costs associated with sublicense agreements in the period in which the expense is incurred 

table of contents sales rebates  discounts and incentives in the us  we sell antara and factive to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of the product 
when we deliver our product  we reduce the amount of gross revenue recognized from such product sales based primarily on estimates of four categories of discounts and allowances that suggest that all or part of the revenue should not be recognized at the time of the delivery product returns  cash discounts  rebates  and special promotional programs 
product returns factors that are considered in our estimate of future antara and factive product returns include an analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channel  review of consumer consumption data as reported by external information management companies  actual and historical return rates for expired lots  return rates for similar competitive antibiotic and cardiovascular products that have a similar shelf life and are sold in the same distribution channel  the remaining time to expiration of our product  and our forecast of future sales of our product 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return product within six months prior to  and twelve months subsequent to  the expiration date of our product 
antara capsules and factive tablets each have a month expiration period from the date of manufacturing 
during  we increased our estimate for product returns as a result of returns of product lots related to the seven day course of treatment of factive tablets 
we believe the product returns were a result of a combination of the shift in product demand from seven day course of treatment to five day course of treatment and returns associated with initial stocking of factive 
as of december  and  our product return reserve was approximately  and  respectively 
this reserve is evaluated on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjusted accordingly 
based on the factors noted above  we believe our estimate of product returns is reasonable  and changes  if any  from this estimate would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
cash discounts our standard invoice includes a contractual cash discount  net days terms 
based on historical experience  we estimate that most of our customers deduct a discount from their balance 
the cash discount reserve is presented as an allowance against trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  the balance of the cash discounts reserve was approximately  and  respectively 
rebates the liability for commercial managed care rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates with respect to each commercial contract 
the liability for medicaid rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each state 
as of december  and  the balance of the accrual for managed care and medicaid rebates for antara and factive in total was approximately  and  respectively 
considering the estimates made by us  as well as estimates reflected in third party utilization reports that are used in evaluating the required liability balance  we believe our estimates are reasonable 
as of december   the significant change to our estimates in the periods presented is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the antara product line 

table of contents special promotional programs from time to time  we offer certain promotional incentives to our customers for both antara and factive and will continue this practice in the future 
such programs include sample cards to retail consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers  and other sales stocking allowances 
we account for these programs in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitfno 

examples of programs utilized to date are as follows voucher rebate programs for antara since acquiring antara in august  we have initiated three voucher rebate programs for antara whereby we offered a point of sale rebate to retail consumers 
the liabilities we recorded for these voucher rebate programs were estimated based upon the historical rebate redemption rates for similar completed programs by other pharmaceutical companies as reported to us by a third party claims processing organization 
the first program expired on december   the second program expired on september   and the third program expires on february  as of december  and  the balance of the liabilities for these voucher programs totaled approximately  and  respectively 
voucher rebate programs for factive we periodically initiate voucher rebate programs for factive whereby we offer mail in rebates and point of sale rebates to retail consumers 
the liabilities we record for these voucher rebate programs are estimated based upon the historical rebate redemption rates for similar completed programs 
in april  we initiated a voucher rebate program whereby we offered a point of sale rebate to retail consumers 
this program expired on december  in october  we initiated another voucher rebated program whereby we offered a point of sale rebate to retail consumers 
this program expires on april  as of december  and  the balance of the liabilities for these voucher programs totaled approximately  and  respectively 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consists of amounts due from wholesalers for the purchase of antara and factive 
ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and collateral is generally not required 
as of december  and  we reserved approximately  and  respectively  for bad debts related to the sale of antara or factive 
we continuously review all customer accounts to determine if an allowance for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
we currently provide substantially all of our distributors with payment terms of up to days on purchases of antara and factive 
amounts past due from customers are determined based on contractual payment terms 
through december   payments have generally been made in a timely manner 
we also reserved and  as of december  and  respectively  related to other non trade receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined under the average cost method which approximates actual cost 
products are removed from inventory on a first in first out basis and recognized as cost of goods sold on an average cost basis 
for antara  inventories consist of raw material and work in process of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  and antara finished capsules of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
for factive  inventories consist of raw material in powder form and work in process of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  and factive finished tablets of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and provide a reserve for inventory and marketing samples that have become obsolete  have a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or are in excess of forecast requirements to cost of product revenues and marketing expense  respectively 
during  approximately  of antara inventory obtained in the product acquisition became obsolete and was expensed 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off against the previously established reserves 
at december  and  there was approximately  and  in antara sample product to be used for antara marketing programs and there was approximately  and  in factive sample product to be used for factive marketing programs 
these are classified as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability measurement and estimating the undiscounted cash flows are each done at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  then the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
any write downs are recorded as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset 
during  events and circumstances  primarily a reduction in projected long term cash flows  indicated that the factive intangible asset could become impaired 
however  at december   our estimate of the undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts are expected to be recovered and therefore  the assets are not impaired 
nonetheless  it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term resulting in the need to write down the intangible asset associated with factive to fair value 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows is based upon several significant assumptions including  but not limited to  estimated domestic sales growth  the ability to significantly penetrate international markets and the ability to satisfy our minimum requirements under the agreement with the licensor  lg life sciences 
we also follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed periodically for impairment 
we perform an annual evaluation of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year to test for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the entity with our book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  then we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the book value  then an impairment charge would be recorded 
as of december   we do not believe that any of our long lived assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets are impaired

 and determined that the exchange represents an extinguishment of existing debt rather than a modification 
we recorded a gain of approximately  upon the extinguishment of debt  which was a result of exchanging a majority of the original notes and a portion of the notes that were issued at par value  for the new notes that were issued at of par ie a discount 
the gain arose due to the fact that the fair value of the original notes exceeded that of the new notes 
the debt issuance costs related to the original notes in the amount of approximately  are netted against the gain 
the additional interest payment described above  which may be issued upon conversion  is considered an embedded derivative under sfas no 
and requires bifurcation from the host debt 
we also considered the provisions of eitf no 
 and concluded that this is not conventional convertible debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have separately accounted for the additional interest payment feature of the new notes as an embedded derivative instrument  which is measured at fair value and classified on the consolidated balance sheets as other long term liabilities 
changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recognized in earnings 
the derivative liability is revalued quarterly and changes in the fair value through either the date the additional interest payment provisions expire  at which the liability will be zero  or the date at which the additional interest payment provision is triggered  are recorded as other expense or income 
for the purpose of accounting for the new notes issued in the exchange offer  the fair value of the embedded derivative

once the cumulative royalty payments to paul capital exceed million  the royalties become nominal 
in connection with the revenue agreement  we recorded a liability  referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately  in accordance with eitf no 
 sales of future revenues eitf no 

we will impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and will record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of antara and factive sales 
payments made to paul capital as a result of antara and factive sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability
