risk factors 
the company is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  the outcome of which may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
these risks are as follows loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on estimates and may not be sufficient to cover future losses 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred  including events that have incurred which have not yet been reported to the company 
there is a high level of uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of the required losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for the company 
the long tailed nature of liability claims and the volatility of jury awards exacerbate that uncertainty 
the company sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date at management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses 
the ultimate cost of claims is dependent upon future events  the outcomes of which are affected by many factors 
company claim reserving procedures and settlement philosophy  current and perceived social and economic inflation  current and future court rulings and jury attitudes  improvements in medical technology  and many other economic  scientific  legal  political  and social factors all can have significant effects on the ultimate costs of claims 
changes in company operations and management philosophy also may cause actual developments to vary from the past 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations depend in large part on the company s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses  and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation availability of sufficient reliable data 
incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data 
uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions 
selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies 
adoption of successful pricing strategies 
prediction of policyholder retention eg  policy life expectancy 
unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action 
ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices 
unexpected inflation 
social changes  particularly those affecting litigious inclinations 
such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate  or inaccurate data  or inappropriate analyses  assumptions  or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could under price risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s operating results  financial condition  and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
inability to obtain reinsurance or to collect on ceded reinsurance could adversely affect the company s ability to write new policies 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance will increase the risk of loss and could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition 
ceded reinsurance does not discharge the company s direct obligations under the policies it writes 
the company remains liable to its policyholders even if the company is unable to make recoveries that it believes it s entitled to under the reinsurance contracts 
losses may not be recovered from the reinsurers until claims are paid 
the insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and legislative changes  which may impact the manner in which the company operates its business 
the insurance business is subject to extensive regulation by the california department of insurance 
the california department of insurance has broad regulatory powers implemented to protect policyholders  not stockholders or other investors 
these powers include  among other things  the ability to place limitations on the company s investments and dividends 
place limitations on the company s ability to transact business with its affiliates 
establish standards of solvency including minimum reserves and capital surplus requirements 
prescribe the form and content of  and to examine  the company s financial statements 
federal legislation typically does not directly impact the property and casualty business  but the business can be indirectly affected by changes in federal regulations 
this extensive regulation may affect the cost or demand for the company s products and may limit the ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that the company might desire to do in order to increase its profitability 
a downgrade in the financial strength rating of the insurance company could reduce the amount of business it may be able to write 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of an ability to pay claims 
am best company has upgraded crusader s financial strength rating from b good to b good  effective january   and upgraded crusader s rating outlook from stable to positive  effective january  the financial strength rating of am best is subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agents and are not intended for the protection of investors 
any downgrade in the company s am best rating could cause a reduction in the number of policies it writes and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position 
intense competition could adversely affect the ability to sell policies at premium rates the company deems adequate 
the company faces significant competition which  at times  is intense 
if the company is unable to compete effectively its business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition in the property and casualty marketplace is based on many factors including premiums charged  services provided  financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation  perceived financial strength  and general experience 
the company competes with regional and national insurance companies 
some competitors have greater financial  marketing  and management resources than the company 
intense competitive pressure on prices can result from the actions of even a single large competitor 
the company uses its own  proprietary premium rates to determine the price for its property and casualty policies 
the company s earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates 
investment income is an important component of the company s revenues and net income 
the ability to achieve investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond the company s control 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
any significant decline in investment income as a result of falling interest rates or general market conditions would have an adverse effect on net income and  as a result  on the company s stockholders equity and policyholders surplus 
the outlook of the company s investment income is dependent on the future direction of interest rates and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment 
the fair values of fixed maturity investments that are available for sale fluctuate with changes in interest rates and cause fluctuations in the stockholders equity 
the company s geographic concentration ties its performance to the business  economic  and regulatory conditions in california 
the company s insurance business is concentrated in california of gross written premium in through 
accordingly  unfavorable business  economic or regulatory conditions in the state of california could negatively impact the company s performance 
in addition  california is exposed to severe natural perils  such as earthquakes and fires  along with the possibility of terrorist acts 
accordingly  the company could suffer losses as a result of catastrophic events 
the company relies on independent insurance agents and brokers 
the failure or inability of independent insurance agents and brokers to market the company s insurance programs successfully could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
independent brokers are not obligated to promote the company s insurance programs and may sell competitors insurance programs 
the company s business largely depends on the marketing efforts of independent brokers and on the company s ability to offer insurance programs and services that meet the requirements of those brokers customers 
litigation may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the insurance industry is the target of an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation  some of which involve claims for substantial and or indeterminate amounts and the outcomes of which are unpredictable 
this litigation is based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices 
although the company has not been the target of any specific class action lawsuits  it is possible that a suit of this type could have a negative impact on the company s business 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability  and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and to maintain its policyholder data 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems or the loss of data contained in the systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs  and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters 
terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers 
power loss 
unauthorized access 
computer systems or data network failure 
it is possible that a system failure  accident  or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized  and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot ensure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on its stock price 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers  and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
the company must hire and train new employees and retain current employees to handle its operations 
the failure of the company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could result in the company having to slow the growth of its business 
in addition  the failure to adequately staff its claims department could result in decreased quality of the company s claims operations 
the company s success also depends heavily upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
the company  by virtue of the nature of the business conducted by it  becomes involved in numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either plaintiff or defendant 
incidental actions are sometimes brought by customers or others that relate to disputes concerning the issuance or non issuance of individual insurance policies or other matters

revenue and income generation the company receives its revenue primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operations  commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations  finance charges and fee income from the premium finance operations  and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance company operation 
the insurance company operation generates approximately of the company s total revenue 
the company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services  each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues 
insurance company operation the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers  ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller  specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product 
many of the company s existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources  have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as am best company  have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the company 
crusader is writing primarily commercial multiple peril business only in the state of california 
am best company has upgraded crusader s financial strength rating from b good to b good  effective january   and upgraded crusader s rating outlook from stable to positive  on january  a primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is contending with the fact that the company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known 
that is  when pricing its products  the company must forecast the ultimate claim and loss adjustment costs 
in addition  factors such as changes in regulations and legal environment  among other things  can all impact the accuracy of such cost forecasts 
the property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by periods of soft market conditions  in which premium rates are stable or falling and insurance is readily available  and by periods of hard market conditions  in which premium rates rise  coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers profits increase 
the company believes that the california property and casualty insurance market has transitioned to a soft market in the past few years 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
despite the increased competition in the property and casualty marketplace  the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth  and that underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs is its primary goal 
for the year ended december   gross written premium was  a decrease of  compared to for the twelve months ended december   losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were  offset by  of favorable development for events of prior years 
for the twelve months ended december   losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were  offset by  of favorable development for events of prior years 
the favorable developments resulted from settling or re estimating claims for lesser amounts than they were previously forecast 
other operations the company s other operations generate commissions  fees  and finance charges from various insurance products 
the events that have the most significant economic impact are as follows unifax primarily sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
policy fee income for the twelve months ended december   decreased as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in policy fee income is a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during the twelve months ended december   as compared to aaqhc provides various consumer benefits to its members  including participation in group health care insurance policies 
for these services  aaqhc receives membership and fee income from its members 
membership and fee income increased in the year ended december   compared to the increase is a result of the increase in the number of members 
in may  cigna healthcare began offering new small group medical insurance policies in the state of california 
currently  all new cigna small group medical insurance policies are written through aib and all cigna small group medical insurance policyholders are members of aaqhc 
aib sells and services health insurance policies for individual family and small business groups and receives commissions based on the premiums that it writes 
commission income increased for the year ended december   compared to the increase is primarily due to the increase in sales of small group medical insurance offered through cigna healthcare as discussed above 
aac provides premium financing for crusader policies that are produced by unifax in california 
finance charges and fees earned by aac during decreased as compared to the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of loans issued in compared to average premium financed increased to  in from  in the daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by bedford insurance services  inc bedford receives a commission from a non affiliated insurance company based on premium written 
commission in the daily automobile rental insurance program increased  as compared to investments and liquidity the company generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million at amortized cost at both december   and december  investment income for the twelve months ended december   increased million in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in the company s annualized yield on average invested assets from in to in the increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets is a result of higher yields in the marketplace on both new and reinvested assets 
due to the current interest rate environment  management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with maturities of five years or less and with minimal credit risk 
as of december   the weighted average maturity of the company s fixed maturity investments was years compared to years and years as of december   and december   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
the cash flow used by operations in the year ended december   was  a decrease in cash flow of  compared to the cash flow for the year ending december  the company has primarily utilized the cash from the maturity of its fixed maturity investments to purchase million of fixed maturity securities in cash flow provided by operations in the year ended december   was  a decrease in cash flow of  compared to the cash flow for the year ending december  the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities and from the maturity of its fixed maturity investments primarily to purchase million of fixed maturity securities in the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company is adverse development of the insurance company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
however  no assurance can be given that the company s estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will be sufficient 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments 
cash and investments excluding net unrealized gains or losses at december   were  compared to  at december  crusader s cash and investments at december   was  or of the total held by the company  compared to  or of the total held by the company at december  the company s investments are as follows december  december  december  amount amount amount fixed maturities at amortized cost certificates of deposit us treasury securities us government sponsored enterprise securities industrial and miscellaneous taxable state and municipal tax exempt total fixed maturity investments short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit cash deposit in lieu of bond commercial paper bank money market accounts us government money market fund short term us treasury bills bank savings accounts total short term cash investments total investments deposits with superior courts to stay execution of judgment pending appeal of crusader claims 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investment securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading securities 
although all of the company s investment in fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
the company s investment guidelines on equity securities limit investments in equity securities to an aggregate maximum of  the company s investment guidelines on fixed maturities limit those investments to high grade obligations with a maximum term of eight years 
the maximum investment authorized in any one issuer is  and the maximum in any one us government agency or us government sponsored enterprise is  this dollar limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and us government or us government guaranteed issues

as a california insurance company  crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states that crusader is admitted 
premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes 
the company has certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows total within year years years after years contractual obligations building lease loss and loss adjustment expense reserves total unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates 
results of operations general the company had net income of  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the year ended december   and net income of  for the year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to income before taxes of  in the year ended december   a decrease in income before taxes of  the decrease in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader

premiums for the year ended december   gross written premium decreased by  over for the year ended december   gross written premium decreased by  over the decrease in written premium in both and reflected heightened competition and management s continued emphasis on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market condition will continue  nor in which direction it might change 
the insurance marketplace continues to become more competitive 
there are more insurers competing for the same customers 
many of those competitors price their insurance at rates that crusader believes are inadequate to support any profit 
nonetheless  crusader believes that it can grow its sales and profitability by continuing to focus upon three key areas of its operations product development  improved service to retail brokers  and appointment of captive and independent retail agents 
during the year  crusader plans to introduce many product changes such as  changes in its rates  eligibility guidelines  rules and coverage forms 
improved service to retail brokers is primarily focused upon transacting business through the internet  as well as providing more options to make the brokers time more efficiently spent with us ie  as opposed to spending time with our competitors 
during  crusader employed two full time marketing representatives 
those individuals are charged with the responsibility of identifying product development opportunities  promoting the company and its products to the brokerage community  and charged with the duty to appoint retail agents  so as to introduce the crusader brand at the consumer s level of distribution ie  retail 
crusader plans to have approximately twelve retail agents appointed by the end of year  and approximately twenty four by the end of year presently it is expected that each such retail agent should be able to reach an annual sales volume of approximately one to two million dollars of crusader s products within three to five years of their appointment by the company 
the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term 
premium earned before reinsurance decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in earned premium before reinsurance in both and is a direct result of the decrease in written premium in and  respectively

the portion of the premium dollar expected to pay claims costs is referred to as the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
accident years through had substantially the same expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
the company s emerging loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for each accident year are reviewed in detail at the end of each quarter as part of the reserve diagnostics testing 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as indicated in the above table  the loss ratio for the year ended december   increased to from in and decreased to in from in the increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of favorable development of prior years losses recognized in as compared to during  the company recognized  of favorable development of prior years losses as compared to  of favorable developments of prior years losses recognized during generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
the company s net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar year ended december   were  this amount is comprised of accident year net losses and loss adjustment expenses of  and favorable development of prior accident years of  the company s net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar year ended december   were  this amount is comprised of accident year net losses and loss adjustment expenses of  and favorable development of prior accident years of  the company s net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar year ended december   were  this amount is comprised of accident year net losses and loss adjustment expenses of  and favorable development of prior accident years of  the favorable adverse development by accident year is as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  accident year favorable adverse development of total favorable development of total favorable development of total prior to total prior accident years as reflected in the above table  the amount of favorable development recognized during the year ended december   decreased  from  in to  in the decrease is a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses for accident year during the calendar year this favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of losses during relative to expectations used to establish loss reserves at the end of and the severity of late reported property and casualty claims that emerged during was lower than expected and case development on previously reported claims was better than expected 
during the fourth quarter of the company determined that the favorable development of accident year  which developed during  was sufficient to warrant a reduction in the ultimate expected losses and loss adjustment expenses for that accident year 
during the first three quarters of  the company determined that the development during that period was not sufficient to warrant reducing accident year reserves further than previously recorded 
because the incidence of the cmp losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for this line are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  the favorable development recognized in had a minimal effect on our determination of carried cmp loss reserves at december  the adjustment of prior accident year reserves discussed above is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods 
any reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses from redundancies in the company s december   reserves over actual future payments  and or any additional losses and loss adjustment expenses from actual future payments that exceed the company s reserves  will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations of future accounting periods 
the company s current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption closely approximates the company s historical average loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
a difference between the company s current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption and the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for a given accident year will ultimately result in a dollar change either higher or lower that is a multiple of the earned premium for that year 
the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within five percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in five of the company s twenty three years 
since the company s net earned premium in was  a difference between the accident year actual and current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios of only five percentage points will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within ten percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in ten of the company s twenty three years 
a difference of ten percentage points on accident year will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within twenty percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in sixteen of the company s twenty three years 
a twenty percentage point difference between the accident year actual and the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  in addition  accident years and prior are still developing 
future development on those years might either offset or add to any future development that emerges on accident year reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the company s liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves consists of case reserves and reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
case reserves are established by claims personnel based on a review of the facts known at the time the claim is reported and are subsequently revised as more information about a claim becomes known 
ibnr is computed using various actuarial methods and techniques and includes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported to the company  and a provision for expected future development on case reserves for information not currently known 
the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are as follows year ended december direct reserves case reserves ibnr reserves total direct reserves reserves net of reinsurance case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of crusader s lines of business were as follows year ended december line of business cmp other liability other total the company s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and related loss adjustment expenses of the insurance company operation 
the company sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date at management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and all related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date  for both reported and unreported claims 
analysis of the roll forward of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the following table provides an analysis of the roll forward of crusader s losses and loss adjustment expenses  including a reconciliation of the ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated year ended december reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net of reinsurance incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current year decrease in provision for events of prior years total losses and loss adjustment expenses payments losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years total payments reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year net of reinsurance reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year per balance sheet  gross of reinsurance in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported for gaap as assets rather than netted against the corresponding liability for such items on the balance sheet 
the company s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserve was  as of december  since underwriting profit is a significant part of income  a small percentage change in reserve estimates may result in a substantial effect on future reported earnings 
such changes might result from a variety of factors  including claims costs emerging in a different pattern than the average historical development patterns 
considering the continuum of possible development patterns  none of which is necessarily more or less likely than the next  one must consider the varying probabilities that the development pattern is off in varying degrees 
if future development ultimately ends up being five percent different than the company s reserve  approximately million would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
a variance of five percent of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is not an unlikely scenario 
similarly  a variance of ten percent of the company s reserves would be reflected in approximately million in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
this is also not an unlikely scenario 
differences of more than ten percent are also possible  though not quite as likely as differences of ten percent or less

the fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position for a continuous period over months consisted of us treasury securities  investment grade industrial securities  and pre refunded municipal bonds 
the unrealized loss was primarily due to rising interest rates 
the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  and whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments 
the company has the ability and intent to hold its fixed maturity investments for a period of time sufficient to allow the company to recover its costs 
the company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of  at december   were temporary in nature 
however  facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in fair value considered to be other than temporary

commissions to agents brokers are as follows year ended december commission to agents brokers commissions to agents brokers not including commissions on crusader policies that are reflected in policy acquisition costs are generally related to gross commission income from the health insurance program  the daily automobile rental insurance program  and the earthquake program 
commissions to agents and brokers increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of the increase in written premium in the health insurance program and is related to the increase in commission income from that program 
commissions to agents and brokers decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decreases is primarily the result of a decrease in premiums written and the related decrease in the commission expense in the health insurance program and the daily automobile rental insurance program

fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation became effective january  the company s adoption of fin did not have an effect on its results of operations or financial position 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year after september  sfas no 
amends the accounting for hybrid financial instruments and eliminates the exclusion of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets from the guidance under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it also eliminates the prohibition on the type of derivative instruments that qualified special purpose entities may hold under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 
sop provides accounting guidance for deferred policy acquisition costs associated with internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those already described in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights  or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract 
the provisions of sop became effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  the company s adoption of sop did not have an effect on its results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the main objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity s election on its earnings  but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards 
sfas no 
is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  the company adopted sfas no 
as of the beginning of by not electing the fair value option for any of its financial assets or liabilities 
there were no other accounting standards issued during that are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates  actual results could differ 
management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following losses and loss adjustment expenses the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
management makes its best estimate of the liability for unpaid claims costs as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the company s unpaid claims costs  actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary  perhaps significantly  from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims 
variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  especially for a small insurer like the company 
for any given line of insurance  accident year  or other group of claims  there is a continuum of possible reserve estimates  each having its own unique degree of propriety or reasonableness 
due to the complexity and nature of the insurance claims process  there are potentially an infinite number of reasonably likely scenarios 
the company does not specifically identify reasonably likely scenarios other than utilizing management s best estimate 
in addition to applying the various standard methods to the data  an extensive series of diagnostic tests of the resultant reserve estimates are applied to determine management s best estimate of the unpaid claims liability 
among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns  frequencies expected claim counts  severities average cost per claim  loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to premium  and loss adjustment expense ratios to loss 
when there is clear evidence that the actual claims costs emerged are different than expected for any prior accident year  the claims cost estimates for that year are revised accordingly 
some lines of insurance are commonly referred to as long tail lines because of the extended time required before claims are ultimately settled 
lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quickly are called short tail lines 
it is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long tail lines because of the long period of time that elapses between the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim 
the company s short tail lines consist of its property coverages and its long tail lines consist of its liability coverages 
however  compared to other long tail liability lines that are not underwritten by the company  such as workers compensation  professional liability  umbrella liability  and medical malpractice  the company s liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker 
the company underwrites four statutory annual statement lines of business commercial multiple peril  liability other than automobile and products  fire  and allied lines 
commercial multiple peril policies comprised and of the company s and premium volume  respectively 
commercial multiple peril policies include both property and liability coverages 
for all of the company s coverages and lines of business  the company s actuarial loss and loss adjustment expense reserving methods require assumptions that can be grouped into two key categories expected loss and loss adjustment expense  required by the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter ferguson methods  and expected development patterns  required by the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the company also segregates most of its business into smaller homogeneous categories primarily for management s internal detailed business review and analysis 
these homogeneous categories used by the company include various combinations and special groupings of its lines of business  programs types  states  and coverages 
some categories exclude certain items and or others include certain items 
not all categories are defined in the same way 
this analysis includes the tracking of historical claims costs and development patterns separately for each of these uniquely designed categories 
generally  neither the liability development patterns nor the property development patterns vary significantly by category 
the accurate establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is a difficult process  as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
estimates are based on a variety of industry data and on the company s current and historical accident year claims data  including but not limited to reported claim counts  open claim counts  closed claim counts  closed claim counts with payments  paid losses  paid loss adjustment expenses  case loss reserves  case loss adjustment expense reserves  earned premiums and policy exposures  salvage and subrogation  and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid 
many other factors  including changes in reinsurance  changes in pricing  changes in policy forms and coverage  changes in underwriting and risk selection  legislative changes  results of litigation and inflation are also taken into account 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the company s reserves are re evaluated for each accident year ie  for all claims incurred within each year by a committee consisting of the company s executive vice president  the company s chief financial officer  and an independent consulting actuary 
the company uses the loss ratio method to estimate ultimate claims costs for the current accident year 
the current accident year ibnr reserves are initially determined by multiplying earned premiums for the year by the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  then subtracting the current accident year s cumulative incurred paid plus case reserves to date 
this method is subject to adjustment based upon actual results incurred during the reporting period 
this initial ibnr reserve is adjusted as subsequent development of that accident year takes place 
the company also applies several additional standard actuarial methods to the historical claims costs data to estimate its unpaid claims liability for each accident year 
the additional standard methods include loss development methods and bornhuetter ferguson methods  both of which can be applied to paid loss and loss adjustment expense claims costs  reported incurred paid plus case reserve claims costs  and or claim counts 
these methodologies do not vary by tail length  however  certain parameters do vary 
in particular  loss development factors for short tail property claims are different than for long tail liability claims 
development patterns generally do not tend to change materially over time 
generally  the company has very little property claim development subsequent to the end of an accident year 
although liability claims may take or more years to fully develop  most of the development occurs in the first five to six years subsequent to the end of the accident year 
however  liability claims are substantially developed by two years subsequent to the end of the accident year 
other than the change in the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption discussed above  the company s reserving methodology assumptions have not changed in the years presented and the only significant effect on the company s financial statements has resulted from estimated costs being adjusted as actual costs emerge 
the company s actuarially based loss and loss adjustment expense reserve methodology does not include an implicit or explicit provision for uncertainty 
insurance claims costs are inherently uncertain 
there is not a precise means of quantifying a provision for uncertainty when determining an appropriate liability for unpaid claims costs 
rather  the potential for claims costs being less than estimated and the potential for claims costs being more than estimated are considered when selecting the parameters to be used in the application of the actuarial methods and when testing the estimates for reasonableness 
management believes that its recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserve makes reasonable provision for its liability for unpaid claims costs 
the information that management uses to arrive at its best reserve estimate comes from many sources within the company  including its accounting  legal  claims  and underwriting departments 
informed managerial judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
the company must estimate its ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using a very small claim population size 
at the beginning of  the company had open claim files 
during   new claim files were opened and  claim files were closed  leaving open claim files at the end of due to the small size of the company and the related small population of claims  the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses for any accident year can vary significantly from the initial expectations 
due to the small number of claims  changes in claim frequency and or severity can materially affect the company s reserve estimate 
the potential variability from management s best estimate cannot be measured from any meaningful statistical basis due to the numerous uncertainties in the claims reserving process and the small population of claims 
at each quarterly review  actual claims costs that emerge are compared with the claims costs that were expected to emerge during that development period 
sometimes the previous claims costs estimates prove to have been too high  sometimes they prove to have been too low 
in the case of the company  the estimates proved to be too high in each of the past three years 
the favorable development in through underscores the inherent uncertainty in insurance claims costs  especially for a very small insurer 
calendar year ended december net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net decrease in provision for events of prior years percent of development to beginning reserves the differences between actual and expected claims costs are typically not due to one specific factor  but a combination of many factors such as the period of time between the initial occurrence and the final settlement of the claim  current and perceived social and economic inflation  and many other economic  legal  political  and social factors 
because of these and other factors  actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary  perhaps significantly  from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
reinsurance the company s receivable from reinsurers represents an estimate of the amount of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments that will be recoverable from the company s reinsurers 
these estimates are based upon estimates of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses that the company expects to incur and the portion of those losses that are expected to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of the reinsurance agreements 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses  the estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the company s estimate of the amounts receivable from reinsurers is regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
the company s assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at their inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature 
at december   all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance 
the following tables provide the effect of reinsurance on the company s financial statements the effect of ceded reinsurance on financial position is as follows year ended december ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred on excess of loss treaties ceded paid losses and loss adjustment expenses change in ceded case loss reserves change in ceded ibnr reserves total ceded losses incurred ceded loss and loss adjusting expense recoverable on excess of loss treaties ceded case loss and loss adjusting expense reserves recoverable ceded ibnr reserves recoverable total ceded loss and loss adjusting expense reserves recoverable there were no catastrophe losses incurred during the period covered by this table 
the effect of ceded reinsurance on results of operations is as follows year ended december direct earned premium earned ceded premium excess of loss treaty premium catastrophe treaty premium other total earned ceded premium ceding commission earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission the effect of ceded reinsurance on cash flow is as follows year ended december changes in reinsurance recoverable from statements of cash flows the company s reinsurance strategy is to reduce volatility in its expected loss and loss adjustment expense results by protecting the company against liabilities in excess of certain retentions  including major or catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and or casualty risks which it insures 
on an annual basis  or sooner if warranted  the company evaluates whether any changes to its retention  participation  or retained limits are necessary 
the most significant change to the company s reinsurance program during the three years ended december   was increasing its catastrophic reinsurance in from million to million and to million in the company currently only writes business in the state of california 
the types of businesses and the coverage limits written by the company are not considered difficult lines for obtaining reinsurance 
in addition  because the major catastrophe exposure is primarily from riots and fire following earthquakes  the company does not anticipate significant limitations on its ability to cede future losses on a basis consistent with its historical results 
investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at market value 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
short term investments are carried at cost  which approximates market value 
investments in equity securities are carried at market value 
the unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities and equity securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
when a decline in value of a fixed maturity or equity security is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations based on the specific identification method 
related party transactions the company presently occupies a  square foot office building located at mulholland drive  woodland hills  california  under a master lease expiring march  erwin cheldin  the company s president  chairman  and principal stockholder  is the owner of the building 
the company signed an extension to the lease with a increase in rent effective april  the lease provides for an annual gross rent of  through march   and  from april  through march  in addition  the lease extension provides for two  five year options with a rent increase of for each option period 
the company believes that at the inception of the lease agreement and at each subsequent extension  the terms of the lease were at least as favorable to the company as could have been obtained from non affiliated third parties 
the company utilizes for its own operations approximately of the space it leases 
forward looking statements certain statements contained herein  including the sections entitled business  legal proceedings and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts are forward looking 
these statements  which may be identified by forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate  appears  believe  estimates  expect  intend  may  plans  should  and would involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include those described under item business competition and item a risk factors  premium rate adequacy relating to competition or regulation  actual versus estimated claim experience  the outcome of rate change filings with regulatory authorities  acceptance by insureds of rate changes  adequacy of rate changes  changes in crusader s am best rating  regulatory changes or developments  the outcome of regulatory proceedings  unforeseen calamities  general market conditions  and the company s ability to introduce new profitable products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit over year at cost total invested assets the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were  compared to unrealized losses net of unrealized gains before income taxes of  as of december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of december   would decrease by approximately  this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold or the decrease was deemed to be other than temporary 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk
