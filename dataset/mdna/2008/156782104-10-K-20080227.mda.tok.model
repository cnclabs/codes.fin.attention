item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation below and in note to the financial statements 
item a 
risk factors risks related to cerner corporation 
table of contents we may be subject to product related liabilities 
many of our software solutions  healthcare devices or services including life sciences research services provide data for use by healthcare providers in providing care to patients 
no claims have been brought against us to date regarding injuries related to the use of our software solutions  healthcare devices or services including life sciences research services  but such claims may be made in the future 
although we maintain liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future  prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful material claim brought against us  if uninsured or under insured  could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties 
our software solutions and healthcare devices  particularly the cerner millennium versions  are very complex 
as with complex software solutions and devices offered by others  our software solutions and healthcare devices may contain coding or other errors  especially when first introduced 
although we conduct extensive testing  we have discovered errors in our software solutions and healthcare devices after their introduction 
our software solutions and healthcare devices are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of our software solutions and healthcare devices have a greater sensitivity to errors than the market for software products and devices generally 
our client agreements typically provide warranties concerning material errors and other matters 
failure of a client s cerner software solutions and or healthcare devices to meet these warranties could constitute a material breach under the client agreement  allowing the client to terminate the agreement and possibly obtain a refund and or damages  or might require us to incur additional expense in order to make the software solution or healthcare device meet these criteria 
our client agreements generally limit our liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or circumstances 
a successful material claim brought against us  if uninsured or under insured  could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience interruption at our data centers or client support facilities 
we perform data center and or hosting services for certain clients  including the storage of critical patient and administrative data 
in addition  we provide support services to our clients through various client support facilities 
we have invested in many reliability features such as multiple power feeds  multiple backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines  as well as technical and physical security safeguards  and structured our operations to substantially reduce the likelihood of disruptions 
however  complete failure of all generators  impairment of all telecommunications lines  severe damage environmental  accidental  intentional or pandemic to the buildings  the equipment inside the buildings housing our data centers  the client data contained therein and or the personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively impact clients who depend on us for data center and system support services 
any interruption in operations at our data centers and or client support facilities could damage our reputation  cause us to lose existing clients  hurt our ability to obtain new clients  result in revenue loss  create potential liabilites for our clients and us and increase insurance and other operating costs 
our proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights of others  or may be infringed or misappropriated by others 
we rely upon a combination of license agreements  confidentiality procedures  employee nondisclosure agreements  confidentiality agreements with third parties and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information 
we also rely on trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and abroad 
we have initiated a patent program but currently have a limited patent portfolio in the united states and abroad 
despite our protective measures and intellectual property rights  we may not be able to adequately protect against copying  reverse engineering  misappropriation  infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property 
in addition  we could be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims as the number of competitors  patents and patent enforcement organizations in the hit market increases  the functionality of our software solutions and services expands  and we enter new markets such as healthcare device innovation  healthcare transactions and life sciences 
these claims  even if not 
table of contents meritorious  could be expensive to defend 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award  develop alternative technology  obtain a license and or cease using  selling  licensing  implementing and supporting the solutions  devices and services that violate the intellectual property rights 
we are subject to risks associated with our non us operations 
we market  sell and service our solutions  devices and services globally 
we have established offices around the world  including in the americas  europe  the middle east and the asia pacific region 
we will continue to expand our non us operations and enter new global markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect non us sales and support channels 
our business is generally transacted in the local functional currency 
in some countries  our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
there is a risk that we may sometimes choose the wrong partner 
for these reasons  we may not be able to maintain or increase non us market demand for our solutions  devices and services 
non us operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include  but are not limited to greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods difficulties and costs of staffing and managing non us operations the impact of global economic conditions unfavorable or changing foreign currency exchange rates certification  licensing or regulatory requirements unexpected changes in regulatory requirements changes to or reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries inability to obtain necessary financing on reasonable terms to adequately support non us operations and expansion potentially adverse tax consequences different or additional functionality requirements trade protection measures export control regulations service provider and government spending patterns natural disasters  war or terrorist acts poor selection of a partner in a country political conditions which may impact sales or threaten the safety of associates or our continued presence in these countries our failure to effectively hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could unfavorably affect our performance 
we utilize derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about risk on financial instruments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under market risk 
further  our financial results from non us operations may decrease if we fail to execute or improperly hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations 
our success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel 
to remain competitive in our industries  we must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel  including executives  consultants  programmers and systems architects skilled in the hit  healthcare devices  healthcare transactions and life sciences industries and the technical environments in which our solutions  devices and services are needed 
competition for such personnel in our industries is intense in both the united states and abroad 
our failure to attract additional qualified personnel to meet our non us personnel needs could have a material adverse effect on our prospects for long term growth 
our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel 
the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact to our business and results of 
table of contents operations  and could potentially inhibit development and delivery of our solutions  devices and services and market share advances 
we rely significantly on third party suppliers 
we license or purchase intellectual property and technology such as software  hardware and content from third parties  including some competitors  and incorporate software  hardware  and or content into or sell it in conjunction with our solutions  devices and services  some of which are critical to the operation and delivery of our solutions  devices and services 
if any of the third party suppliers were to change product offerings  significantly increase prices or terminate our licenses or supply contracts  we might need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our solutions  devices and services 
such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms  or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by our existing suppliers 
if the cost of licensing  purchasing or maintaining the third party intellectual property or technology significantly increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
in addition  interruption in functionality of our solutions  devices and services as a result of changes in third party suppliers could adversely affect future sales of solutions  devices and services 
we intend to continue strategic business acquisitions which are subject to inherent risks 
in order to expand our solutions  device offerings and services and grow our market and client base  we may continue to seek and complete strategic business acquisitions that we believe are complementary to our business 
acquisitions have inherent risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or prospects  including  but not limited to failure to successfully integrate the business and financial operations  services  intellectual property  solutions or personnel of the acquired business  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  failure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets  loss of clients or key personnel of the acquired business  incurrence of debt and or assumption of known and unknown liabilities  write off of software development costs  goodwill  client lists and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  dilutive issuances of equity securities  and  accounting deficiencies that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of the acquired company  including issues related to internal control over financial reporting and the time and cost associated with remedying such deficiencies 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to these acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses 
risks related to the healthcare information technology  healthcare device and healthcare transaction industry the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
for example  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa continues to have a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the appropriate level of privacy of protected health information 
these regulatory factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our solutions and services 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our solutions and services 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  our client base could be eroded  competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of landing new client relationships becomes greater 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local  state and federal level 
we are subject to a significant and wide ranging number of regulations both within the us and elsewhere  such as  without 
table of contents limitation  regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud  e prescribing  claims processing and transmission  medical devices  the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability standards 
healthcare fraud 
federal and state governments continue to strengthen their positions and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
our healthcare provider clients are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which  among other things  prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals  or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs 
federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding  powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse 
the effect of this government regulation on our clients is difficult to predict 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with any applicable laws  many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be applicable to us  are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts 
they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the way in which they deal with us 
if such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to us and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations  we could be subject to sanctions or liability  including exclusion from government health programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
e prescribing 
the use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law 
states have differing prescription format requirements  which we have programmed into our software 
in addition  in november  the department of health and human services announced regulations by cms related to e prescribing and the prescription drug program e prescribing regulations 
these e prescribing regulations were mandated by the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the e prescribing regulations set forth standards for the transmission of electronic prescriptions 
the final regulations adopted two standards effective january a second and final set of required standards are to be published no later than april  and implemented no later than april  these standards are detailed and significant  and cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information 
our efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these regulations could be time consuming and expensive 
claims transmissions 
certain of our solutions assist our clients in submitting claims to payers  which claims are governed by federal and state laws 
our solutions are capable of electronically transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients payers for approval and reimbursement 
federal law provides civil liability to any person that knowingly submits a claim to a payer  including  for example  medicare  medicaid and private health plans  seeking payment for any services or items that have not been provided to the patient 
federal law may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims 
we have policies and procedures in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete transmission of claims  provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete 
the hipaa security  privacy and transaction standards  as discussed below  also have a potentially significant effect on our claims transmission services  since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients hipaa compliance obligations 
regulation of medical devices 
the united states food and drug administration the fda has declared that certain of our solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act act and amendments to the act 
as a consequence  we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda with regard to those solutions that are actively regulated 
other countries have similar regulations in place related to medical devices  that now or may in the future apply to certain of our solutions 
if other of our solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we do business  we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance 
complying with these medical device regulations on a global perspective is time consuming and expensive 
further  it is possible that these regulatory agencies may become more active in regulating software that is used in healthcare 

table of contents there have been nine fda inspections since at various cerner sites 
inspections conducted at our world headquarters in and our prior houston  texas facility in each resulted in the issuance of an fda form that we responded to promptly 
the fda has taken no further action with respect to either of the form s that were issued in and the remaining seven fda inspections  including inspections at our world headquarters in and  resulted in no issuance of a form we remain subject to periodic fda inspections and we could be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our solutions 
the fda has many enforcement tools including recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and or criminal prosecutions 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
security and privacy of patient information 
state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures 
regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
hipaa regulations require national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
covered entities under hipaa  which include healthcare organizations such as our clients  were required to comply with the privacy standards by april  the transaction regulations by october and the security regulations by april as a business associate of the covered entities  we  in most instances  must also ensure compliance with the hipaa regulations as it pertains to our clients 
we are unable to predict what interpretations of or changes to the regulations issued pursuant to hipaa  might be issued or made in the future or how those interpretations or changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance with hipaa 
evolving hipaa related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our clients to obtain  use or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for our solutions if they are not re designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new interpretations or regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our clients to execute new or modified healthcare transactions 
we may need to expend additional capital  software development and other resources to modify our solutions and devices to address these evolving data security and privacy issues 
interoperability standards 
our clients are concerned with and often require that our software solutions and healthcare devices be interoperable with other third party hit suppliers 
market forces or governmental regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that would apply to our solutions  and if our software solutions and or healthcare devices are not consistent with those standards  we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs to conform 
currently  the certification commission for healthcare information technology cchit is developing a comprehensive set of criteria for the functionality  interoperability and security of various software modules in the hit industry 
achieving cchit certification is becoming a competitive requirement  resulting in increased software development and administrative expense to conform to these requirements 
if our software solutions and healthcare devices are not consistent with emerging standards  our market position and sales could be impaired and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our software solutions and healthcare devices 
we operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries  and our ability to successfully compete and continue to grow our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to market changes and changing technologies and to bring competitive new solutions  devices  features and services to market in a timely fashion 
the market for healthcare information systems  healthcare devices  healthcare transactions and life sciences consulting services are intensely competitive  dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological and innovative changes 
development of new proprietary technology or services is complex  entails significant time and expense and may not be 
table of contents successful 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to introduce new solutions  devices or services on schedule  or at all  nor can we guarantee that  despite extensive testing  errors will not be found in our new solution releases  devices or services before or after commercial release  which could result in solution  device or service delivery redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  market acceptance 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the healthcare information market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings  the stability of the solution provider  the features and capabilities of the information systems and devices  the ongoing support for the systems and devices and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions and devices 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than us and some of our competitors offer software solutions that we do not offer 
our principal existing competitors are set forth above part  item competition 
in addition  we expect that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions  devices or services 
we face strong competitors and often face downward price pressure 
additionally  the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions  software solution enhancements  device introductions  device enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  our success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive pricing model  keep pace with technological change and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced software solutions  devices and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance 
there are a limited number of hospitals and other healthcare providers in the us hit market 
as costs fall  technology improves  and market factors continue to compel investment by healthcare organizations in solutions and services like ours  market saturation in the us may change the competitive landscape in favor of larger  more diversified competitors with greater scale 
risks related to our stock our quarterly operating results may vary which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods  including  variations from guidance  expectations or historical results or trends 
quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes  demand for our solutions  devices and services  the financial condition of our clients and potential clients  our long sales cycle  potentially long installation and implementation cycles for larger  more complex and higher priced systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for our cerner millennium solutions  a large percentage of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger  more complex and higher priced systems 
the sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client 
sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients internal budgets  procedures for approving large capital expenditures  competing needs for other capital expenditures  availability of personnel resources and by actions taken by competitors 
delays in the expected sale  installation or implementation of these large systems may have a significant impact on our anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently our earnings  since a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed 
we recognize software revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon our and our clients abilities to meet project milestones 
delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter 
our revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year  primarily as a result of clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the then current year 
our sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales associates monitor 
table of contents the status of all sales opportunities  such as the date when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
we compare this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in our business 
this analysis provides guidance in business planning and forecasting  but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative 
our pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate 
a negative variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts  or in the pipeline itself  could cause our plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business results 
for example  a slowdown in information technology spending  adverse economic conditions or a variety of other factors can cause purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled  which would reduce the overall pipeline conversion rate in a particular period of time 
because a substantial portion of our contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in our pipeline conversion rate in any given fiscal quarter s 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market for our common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated variations in operating results  rumors about our performance or solutions  devices and services  changes in expectations of future financial performance or estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  healthcare reform measures  client relationship developments  changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as a matter of policy  we do not generally comment on our stock price or rumors 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the markets for software  healthcare and information technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
our directors have authority to issue preferred stock and our corporate governance documents contain anti takeover provisions 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
this includes  but is not limited to  provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit shareholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of shareholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested shareholder  unless certain conditions are met  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business statements made in this report  the annual report to shareholders of which this report is made a part  other reports and proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  communications to shareholders  press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the company that are not historical in nature  or that state the company s or management s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations or predictions of the future  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as could  should  will  intended  continue  believe  may  expect  hope  anticipate  goal  forecast  plan  guidance or estimate or the negative of these words  variations thereof or similar expressions 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results

for item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of cerner corporation cerner or the company 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
management overview cerner primarily derives revenue by selling  implementing and supporting software solutions  clinical content  hardware  healthcare devices and services that give healthcare providers secure access to clinical  administrative and financial data in real time  allowing them to improve the quality  safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare 
we implement the healthcare solutions as stand alone  combined or enterprise wide systems 
cerner millennium software solutions can be managed by the company s clients or in the company s data center via a managed services model 
our fundamental strategy has always centered on creating organic growth by investing in research and development r d to create solutions and services for the healthcare industry 
this strategy has driven strong growth over the long term  with revenue growing at compound annual rates of more than over the past three  five and ten year periods 
this growth has also created a very strategic client base of more than  hospital  health system  physician practice  clinic  laboratory and pharmacy client sites around the world 
selling additional solutions back into this client base is an important element of cerner s future revenue growth 
we are also focused on driving growth through market share expansion by replacing competitors in healthcare settings that are looking to replace their current hit suppliers or by creating new business relationships with those healthcare organizations that have not yet strategically aligned with a supplier 
we also expect to drive growth through new initiatives that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate such as our careaware healthcare device architecture and devices  healthe employer services  physician practice solutions and solutions and services for the pharmaceutical market 
finally  we expect continued strong revenue contributions from the sale of our solutions and services outside of the us many us markets have a low penetration of hit solutions and their governing bodies are in many cases prepared to purchase hit solutions and services 
beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth  we are also focused on earnings growth 
our net earnings have increased at more than compound annual rates over three  five and ten year periods 
we believe we can continue driving strong levels of earnings growth by leveraging key areas to create operating margin expansion 
the primary areas of opportunity for margin expansion include 
table of contents becoming more efficient at implementing our software by leveraging implementation support services and methodologies we have developed that can reduce the amount of effort required to implement our software  leveraging our investments in r d by addressing new markets ie  ie that do not require significant incremental r d but can contribute significantly to revenue growth  and  leveraging our scalable business infrastructure to reduce the rate of increase in general and administrative spending to below our revenue growth rate 
we are also focused on increasing cash flow by growing earnings  reducing the use of working capital and controlling capital expenditures 
while was a year of heavy capital investment because of investments in a new data center to support our rapidly growing hosting business and purchasing new buildings to accommodate growth in our associate base  we expect capital spending to decrease in results overview in  we continued to execute on our core strategies to drive revenue growth  expand operating margins  grow earnings and generate good cash flow 
the results included strong levels of bookings  earnings and cash flow 
new business bookings revenue in  which reflects the value of executed contracts for software  hardware  services and managed services hosting of software in the company s data center was billion  which is an increase of when compared to billion in the and bookings exclude bookings related to the company s participation in the national health services nhs initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in england in the amount of million and million  respectively 
revenues for increased to billion compared to billion in  driven primarily by an increase in support  maintenance and services revenues 
the net earnings increased to million compared to million in diluted earnings per share increased to compared to in the and net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the expensing of stock options 
the effect of accounting under sfas r reduced the net earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  and the earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  respectively 
the growth in net earnings and diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by continued progress with the company s margin expansion initiatives  particularly improving professional services margins and leveraging r d investments 
our operating margin was  and we remain on target with our desire to achieve our long term goal of operating margins 
we had cash collections of receivables of billion in compared to billion in  with the increase driven by increased billings 
days sales outstanding increased to days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the quarter ended december  this increase was driven by an increase in billed receivables as opposed to unbilled items 
operating cash flows for were million compared to million in this year also included progress on our strategic initiatives that  while not yet material to our current results  are an important part of our longer term growth strategy 
in  we made progress in selling and implementing our careaware healthcare device connectivity platform that allows medical devices to be connected to an electronic medical record through a usb like connection 
during  more than clients purchased this solution  with several going live during the year 
initial sales have been to our existing clients  but our careaware architecture gives us the ability to market outside of our installed base  which we expect to do in the future 
in  we also expect to continue expanding the number of devices supported by the careaware architecture  which will increase our market opportunity 
we also delivered our first production careaware rxstation medication dispensing devices in rxstation medication dispensing devices and solutions automate the medication process so both nursing and pharmacy can provide safer care and better management of the medication dispensing and 
table of contents administration process 
in  we expect to leverage our success with early adopter clients and increase marketing of the rxstation devices  with initial efforts focused inside our installed base 
in  we also continued to make progress across our employer focused initiatives that we call healthe employer services  which are targeted at employers looking to reduce health plan administrative costs and improve the health of their employees 
in  cerner s healthe exchange became the third party administrator tpa for three employers representing more than  covered lives 
our tpa approach aims to help employers reduce healthcare friction  such as delays in billing statements and provider payments  resulting in lower costs 
and our healthe clinic was selected by a fortune technology company to provide a fully automated employer based clinic  modeled after our successful on site clinic that has helped improve productivity of our workforce and provided cost savings to our health plan and the participants in the health plan 
healthcare information technology market outlook we have provided a detailed assessment of the healthcare information technology market part  item the healthcare and healthcare it industry

the slight decrease in system sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in software revenue  which was largely offset by an increase in hardware  sublicensed software  and subscriptions revenue 
we believe the decline in software revenue was primarily caused by much of our client base being focused on upgrading to the cerner millennium release 
cerner generally sells a perpetual license  so our clients do not have to pay new license fees when they upgrade to a new version of our software  so the focus by much of our base on implementing the upgrade impacted our software sales

critical accounting policies the company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  potential impairments of goodwill and income taxes 
these policies and the company s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the company s accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes its multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method under sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin s sab revenue recognition and emerging issues task force accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
key factors in the company s revenue recognition model are management s assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the company s software whereas implementation services are not  and the length of time it takes for the company to achieve its delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software 
if the company s business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the 
table of contents company s software  the period of time over which the company s licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen 
the company generally recognizes combined revenue from the sale of its licensed software and related installation services over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
generally  both milestones are achieved in the quarter the contracts are executed 
if the period of time to achieve the company s delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to lengthen  its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change 
the company also recognizes revenue for certain projects using the percentage of completion method pursuant to statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as prescribed by sop the company s revenue recognition is dependent upon the company s ability to reliably estimate the direct labor hours to complete a project 
the company utilizes its historical project experience as a basis for its future estimates to complete current projects 
software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design  which is when the company determines that technological feasibility has been established 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release  and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs 
we historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years 
we expect that trend to continue in the future 
if we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to  the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
the company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon the company s forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs 
historically  use of the company s software programs by its clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more 
the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the hit market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and evaluates impairment indicators at each quarter end 
the company assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that no goodwill was impaired 
the company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods 
goodwill amounted to  and  at december  and december   respectively 
if future  anticipated cash flows from the company s reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected the company s goodwill could be impaired  which could result in significant write offs
