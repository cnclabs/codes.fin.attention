item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases  cancer and viral diseases 
our goal is to file one new investigative new drug  or ind  application in a significant indication each year 
we have achieved this goal each year beginning in our pioneering research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
our productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners to develop and market our product candidates 
we have internal product development programs in inflammatory autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis and thrombocytopenia  and cancer  as well as partnered product development programs relating to asthma and cancer 
we have multiple product candidates in development as follows r product candidate for rheumatoid arthritis ra 
r is our lead product candidate 
it has a novel mechanism of action  blocking igg receptor signaling in macrophages and b cells 
previously  we studied r in a phase single center  double blind  randomized placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single and multiple doses of r we also completed a clinical trial of r to evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetics in combination with methotrexate  a commonly prescribed treatment for ra 
results of this clinical trial suggested that there is not an adverse interaction between r and methotrexate 
we recently completed a phase  multicenter  ascending dose  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  dose ranging study evaluating three doses of r over a week period in ra patients 
all of these patients continued to receive their same previously scheduled dose of methotrexate 
in this clinical trial  r demonstrated statistically significant efficacy results in treating ra patients at two dose levels 
efficacy assessments for each participant were based on the american college of rheumatology criteria which denote a acr improvement  at least a acr improvement  or at least a acr improvement from the baseline assessment at the end of the week treatment period 
patients were also evaluated based on the disease activity score using joint counts  or das  a commonly used measurement outside of the us of disease activity in ra patients 
groups treated with r at mg and mg po bid orally  twice daily showed higher acr  acr  acr and das response rates than the placebo group 
the most common clinically meaningful adverse events noted in the clinical trial were dose related neutropenia  mild elevations of liver function tests and gastrointestinal side effects 
dose reduction to one half the assigned dose by taking the drug once per day was pre specified in the protocol and contingent on neutrophil counts and or liver function tests 
notably  a vast majority of the patients who had their dose reduced successfully completed the clinical trial with minimal safety issues 
we expect to initiate a phase b clinical trial evaluating dosing over a week period 
we also expect to initiate a second phase b clinical trial treating a sub population of ra patients with r by the end of the first half of r product candidate for immune thombocytopenic purpura itp 
platelet destruction from itp is mediated by igg signaling  and r is a potent inhibitor of igg signaling 
in preclinical studies  r was shown to improve thrombocytopenia in an itp mouse model 
we recently completed an exploratory phase clinical trial of r to evaluate its safety and initial efficacy in chronic itp patients 
in this clinical trial  r was orally administered in varying doses for or more days and demonstrated that it can improve platelet counts in highly refractory patients 
we are investigating the design for our next clinical trial of r  which we expect to initiate by the end of r product candidate for b cell lymphoma 
research has shown that overactivity of the signaling enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase  or syk  appears to be an essential mechanism in several types of b cell lymphoma survival and that r can inhibit the growth of b cell lymphoma driven by syk overactivity 
in april  we began enrolling patients in a multicenter  phase clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of r for the treatment of patients with b cell lymphoma 
the clinical trial has enrolled patients at major treatment centers in the united states and will focus on certain types of b cell lymphomas 
we expect to receive interim results from this clinical trial in the second half of r product candidate for ra and other immune disorders 
our jak inhibitor is an orally available potent  selective jak inhibitor 
jak is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation in a variety of autoimmune diseases 
we recently began enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of r we expect to receive interim results from this clinical trial by the end of the first half of r product candidate for oncology 
r as is a potent  highly selective  small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinase 
in october  we signed a licensing agreement with merck serono that gave merck serono an exclusive license to develop and commercialize inhibitors in our aurora kinase program  including r as in november  merck serono exercised its option to add japan to the territories covered under the current aurora kinase collaboration with respect to r as  resulting in a milestone payment to us of million 
under the agreement  merck serono is responsible for the further development and commercialization of r as in september  merck serono initiated a phase multicenter clinical trial to evaluate r as for the treatment of patients with refractory solid tumors 
in february  merck serono began an additional phase clinical trial evaluating r as on patients with hematological malignancies 
merck serono has indicated that interim results from these phase clinical trials are expected in the first and second half of  respectively 
in july  merck serono initiated its third phase clinical trial  designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose  safety and dosing regimen of r as in combination with gemcitabine  a commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic agent administered by intravenous infusion 
the clinical trial will evaluate two different treatment regimens in which r as will be given in sequence with the gemcitabine over day cycles 
as many as patients with advanced malignancies  including pancreatic  ovarian  breast  non small cell lung and colorectal  will be evaluated 
r product candidate for asthma 
in the first quarter of  we announced a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer for the development of inhaled products for the treatment of allergic asthma and other respiratory diseases  such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
the collaboration is focused on our preclinical small molecule compounds  which inhibit ige receptor signaling in respiratory tract mast cells by blocking syk  a novel drug target for respiratory diseases 
mast cells play important roles in both early and late phase allergic reactions  and syk inhibitors could prevent both phases 
in may  pfizer selected r to commence advanced preclinical development in allergic asthma via intrapulmonary delivery 
in december  pfizer commenced a phase clinical trial of an inhaled formulation of r for the treatment of allergic asthma  resulting in a milestone payment to us of million 
preclinical studies have also shown that r is highly effective in a murine model of lupus 
we expect to initiate a phase clinical trial in the second half of corporate collaborations we conduct research and development programs independently and in connection with our corporate collaborations 
we currently have collaborations with six major pharmaceutical biotechnology companies 
these collaborations are one with janssen pharmaceutica nv  a division of johnson johnson  relating to oncology therapeutics and diagnostics  two with pfizer  one initiated in in immunology and the other in january  relating to intrapulmonary asthma and allergy therapeutics  one with novartis pharma ag  or novartis  with respect to four different programs relating to immunology  oncology and chronic bronchitis  one with daiichi pharmaceuticals co  ltd  or daiichi  relating to oncology  one with merck co  inc  or merck  also relating to oncology  and another with merck serono  relating to our aurora kinase inhibitor program 
none of these collaborations currently provides us with regular research reimbursement 
in all of these collaborations  if certain conditions are met  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments and royalties 
we can not guarantee that these conditions will be met or that research and development efforts will be successful 
as a result  we may not receive any further milestone payments or royalties under these agreements 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations ie amortization of upfront fees and certain milestones  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our collaboration arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
when a research term is not specified  we estimate the time it will take us to complete our deliverables under the contract and recognize the upfront fee using the straight line method over that time period 
we review our estimates every quarter for reasonableness 
revenue related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators is recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in the applicable agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements  except for the merck collaboration signed in november related to ubiquitin ligases  approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
for the merck collaboration  we recognized a pro rata portion of the invoiced amounts for funding of our research scientists based on the headcount dedicated to the project 
when the research portion of the collaboration ended in may  we recognized the full amount of the deferred revenue related to the contract as we had no further obligations under the merck collaboration 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended  and that revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the arrangement 
revenues associated with at risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as set forth in the applicable agreement 
stock based compensation aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands stock based compensation recovery expense from officer  director and employee options   consultant options re priced options   total     we grant options to purchase our common stock to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or of the fair market value on the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment revised  or sfas r 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this method  the share based compensation costs recognized beginning january  include compensation costs for i all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas  and ii all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab compensation costs under sfas r for awards granted prior to january  were recognized using an accelerated method pursuant to the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  or fin for awards granted after january   we have adopted the use of the straight line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award 
results of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was insignificant upon adoption of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method 
in addition  pursuant to sfas r  we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs  instead of accounting for forfeitures as incurred  which was our previous method 
we will record actual forfeitures as they occur  and we will review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates 
prior to adopting sfas r on january   we accounted for equity based employee compensation costs under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb under apb  the intrinsic value method of accounting  no compensation expense was recognized  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share was determined as if we had accounted for issuances under our stock option plans and espp under the fair value method prescribed by sfas  as amended by sfas the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
in june  we initiated an offer to exchange options to purchase shares of our common stock with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share to officers  employees  consultants and non employee members of our board of directors 
we granted replacement options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  the fair market value on the date of grant 
any outstanding replacement options expired in august in august  our board of directors granted new options to officers  directors and all other employees and consultants who held these repriced options that expired in august we granted approximately  options with an exercise price of per share 
the options vested at the date of the grant and the remaining will vest monthly over two years 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation recovery of approximately million related to all employee options eligible for replacement 
the recovery resulted from the decrease in the market price of our common stock during for the years ended december  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  and  respectively  relating to the options granted in august the decrease in was due to a vesting on grant date in august we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value valuation and periodic fair value remeasurement of outstanding consultant options under emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf the valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price  risk free interest rate and expected term 
for consultant options granted after january   we amortized stock based compensation using a straight line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of sfas r 
for options granted prior to january   we used the accelerated method for expensing stock based compensation  which was the method we used prior to adoption 
we expect to see continued fluctuations in the future as a portion of these options are remeasured based on the changes in the current market price of our common stock 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  or if the frequency and vesting terms of our grants change  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
the guidance in and application of sfas r and sab may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations    revenues by collaborator were aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands pfizer      merck     merck serono      daiichi   total      contract revenues from collaborations in consisted primarily of a million milestone payment from pfizer  a million milestone payment from merck serono and million in full time equivalent  or fte  and license revenue from merck 
the decrease in revenues in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the recognition of milestone payments totaling million and the full amortization of upfront payment of million from merck serono in contract revenues from collaborations in and consisted primarily of amortization of upfront fees  milestone payments and research support 
the increase in revenues in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the recognition of the merck serono milestone payments totaling million  the full amortization of the merck serono upfront payment of million and the recognition of the pfizer milestone payment of million in offset by the termination of the daiichi collaboration in we had no deferred revenue as of december  our potential future revenues may include certain milestone payments from our current collaboration partners or new collaboration partners we enter into agreements with in the future 
research and development aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands research and development expenses    stock based compensation recovery expense included in research and development expenses     the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was due to the increase in our preclinical and clinical costs and personnel costs 
the increase of preclinical and clinical costs was primarily attributable to costs associated with our phase trials of r in ra  itp and b cell lymphoma 
the increase in personnel costs was attributable to a new company wide bonus program implemented in the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily attributable to an increase in stock based compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r as previously discussed under critical accounting policies and the use of estimates stock based compensation  offset by a decrease in preclinical and clinical costs 
our preclinical and clinical costs in decreased  as compared to the similar period in  primarily due to the termination of the r and r programs in and the transfer of sponsorship relating to r to merck serono in  offset by increased costs relating to our r program  which initiated a phase trial in august we expect that our research and development expenses will substantively increase as we initiate our phase b trials of r in ra  commence our phase trial of r in lupus and continue to manufacture r material to be used in these trials 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps  beginning with the identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials and stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands general and administrative expenses    stock based compensation recovery expense included in general and administrative expenses    the increase in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to a new company wide bonus program implemented in  as well as an increase in legal costs associated with the expansion of our patent portfolio 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r as discussed under critical accounting policies and the use of estimates stock based compensation and increased personnel and facility costs 
interest income aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands interest income     interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances 
there was not a significant change in interest income between and the increase in interest income in  as compared to  was primarily due to the increase in our investment balances as a result of the public offering we completed in july in which we raised million in net proceeds combined with an increase in the interest rates we earned on these balances 
interest expense years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands interest expense interest expense is the result of our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset acquisitions 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was due to the decrease in capital lease obligations outstanding during those periods 
interest expense did not change significantly in as compared to due to comparable capital lease obligations outstanding during both years 
future accounting requirements on december   the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting eitf on our financial statements and can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time 
on june   the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties  and amortize them over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting eitf on our financial statements and can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  or sfas this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   except that under fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 companies are allowed to delay the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november  we elected to delay the adoption of sfas for such assets and liabilities and are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas for all other assets and liabilities on our financial statements 
we can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with few exceptions 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we elected not to adopt the fair value option of sfas at this time 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments payable to us under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and operating expenditures are expected to increase over the next several years 
during  we received payments of approximately million from our collaborations with merck serono  pfizer and merck 
in the second quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
during the first quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through at least the next months 
our operations will require significant additional funding  in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs and the absence of any meaningful revenues for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the timing and structure of potential future collaborations 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend on many uncertain factors 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to establish new collaborations and to maintain our existing collaboration partnerships  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the public offering we completed in the second quarter of in which we raised million in net proceeds  offset by operating spending during we also received approximately million from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option plans and espp plans and approximately  under our equipment financing arrangements 
for the years ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
contractual obligations the following are our contractual commitments  as of december   associated with capital lease and facility lease obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations   facilities lease     total as of december   we had million in capital lease obligations  including principal and interest  associated with our equipment additions 
all existing capital lease agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
in addition  we believe we have no incremental or new risk related to recent credit market volatility 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
