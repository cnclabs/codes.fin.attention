item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k 
business overview rogers corporation is a global enterprise that provides our customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets  including portable communications  communications infrastructure  consumer products  consumer electronics  healthcare  micro processors  mass transit  automotive  ground transportation  and aerospace and defense and alternative energy 
we generate revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacture  and distribution of specialty material based products that are sold to multiple customers  primarily original equipment manufacturers oem s and contract manufacturers that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  our business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
our ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how our customers will react to these changing conditions  it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by our customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  our sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on net sales 
our current focus is on worldwide markets that have an increasing percentage of materials being used to support growing high technology applications  such as cellular base stations and antennas  handheld wireless devices  satellite television receivers and automotive electronics 
we continue to focus on business opportunities around the globe and particularly in the asian marketplace  as evidenced by the continued investment in and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in suzhou  china  which functions as our manufacturing base to serve our customers in asia 
our goal is to become the supplier of choice for our customers in all of the various markets in which we participate 
to achieve this goal  we strive to make the best products in these respective markets and to deliver the highest level of service to our customers 
in the past few years  we have worked to better align our business with our customers  which includes having manufacturing capacity close to our customers in order to be responsive to their needs and to manufacture the highest quality products 
to reach these goals  we have invested significantly in our operations in china as many of our products  including electroluminescent el lamps  power distribution system products  elastomer components and floats are now being manufactured at our suzhou  china facility 
we continue to focus on the expansion of this facility  particularly as demand for our products increases in the asian marketplace 
in  we added additional capacity in our polyurethane foam products at our suzhou facility through our rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris joint venture to better meet the demand for our high end foam products in the asian marketplace 
we are also planning to add manufacturing capacity for our printed circuit material products in the future 
much of our recent growth can be attributable to our efforts related to our china operations 
our operating results were not as strong as initially expected  as we experienced a decline in sales and profits in certain businesses 
the primary driver of these declines were program terminations in the portable communications market related to custom electrical component products  which occurred at a pace greater than initially expected  as well as the continued decline in our flexible circuit materials business 
these events  along with the reduced outlook for future market demand for these products  led to the restructuring of the organization in the second quarter of in an effort to better align our business strategy and overhead structure with the expected sales 
these efforts resulted in a net pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million in  which included severance costs associated with a company wide headcount reduction  a shortening of the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment and contracts  an increase in reserves associated with potentially unsaleable inventory and costs associated with the impairment of certain long lived assets 
we also took additional steps to control discretionary spending and improve our working capital position through focused inventory reduction efforts 
also  in the third quarter of  we formally exited our polyolefin foam business  which has been treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes and prior periods have been restated to reflect our results from continuing operations 
partially offsetting these declines  our power distribution systems operating segment experienced record sales levels in and our other core businesses in our high performance foams reportable segment  as well as our high frequency materials products  continue to perform well 
we believe these core businesses will provide us with a solid foundation to grow our business in the future 
overall  we believe that  as a result of the efforts we have undertaken in  we are better positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in our strategic businesses  as well as opportunities in our new business development efforts 
however  we also believe that will be a difficult year  particularly in light of the tumultuous economic environment we are now operating in 
we will make every effort to position ourselves to take advantage of the long term future opportunities we believe exist for both our current product portfolio  as well as for the new products we are developing as part of our r d efforts and the new business opportunities we are pursuing through our focused business development efforts 
in the short term  we will focus on continuing to control costs and on operating as efficiently as possible 
we will also continue to focus on positioning our current portfolio of products for future success  which includes evaluating strategic options for certain products  such as flexible circuits and el lamps  in order to better align these businesses with the long term strategic goals of our company 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales manufacturing margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating income equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of from million of sales in the decrease in sales is primarily due to a decrease in the custom electrical components reportable segment from million in to million in and in the printed circuit materials reportable segment of million  or  from million to million  partially offset by an increase in sales in our high performance foams reportable segment of million  or  from million to million 
the factors resulting in these changes in sales are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased approximately basis points to in from in margins decreased for all segments but primarily in the custom electrical components reportable segment  where lower volumes and increased pricing pressures eroded margins 
also  we encountered increased material costs across several of our businesses  as well as decreased operating leverage  particularly in our flexible materials business  which further impacted margins 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the results included million in costs associated with the acceleration of certain contract expenses and the accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to the second and third quarter restructuring activities 
the results also included additional costs related to professional services fees  contract expenses and stock compensation expense  partially offset by a decline in incentive compensation expense in as compared to overall selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses had a minimal increase from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses increased slightly in to as compared to in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges in were million as compared to million in the charges in related primarily to our durel and flexible circuit materials businesses 
the charges consisted of i accelerated depreciation and amortization on fixed assets and contracts million  ii increase in inventory reserves million  iii severance costs related to a company wide headcount reduction million  and iv the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials operating segment million 
for income statement presentation purposes  approximately million of these charges are included in cost of sales  million are included in selling and administrative expenses and million are included in restructuring and impairment charges 
the charge in of million is related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our polyester based industrial laminates business and is included in restructuring and impairment charges in our statements of income 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows durel in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our durel operating segment  which is aggregated into our custom electrical components reportable segment 
this charge included a million restructuring charge related to the write down of inventory and accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment related to the durel business and a million charge related to the accelerated expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with a certain flexible electroluminescent el lamp product 
these charges were partially offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved for in the second quarter of these charges resulted from a significant change in the current outlook for existing and future el lamp programs during the second quarter of based on information related to certain program terminations from our most significant customer of el lamps in the portable communications market 
as a result of this change in business conditions  all remaining production of el lamps for the portable communications market that was located at durel s manufacturing facility in arizona was shifted to china by the end of the second quarter of we also expect to have substantially all el production  including lamps for the automotive industry  shifted to our china facility by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the significant change in the outlook of el programs and the planned shift in el production to china was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of the durel business in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter of closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  led us to conclude that no impairment charge associated with the durel long lived assets was necessary 
as such  in accordance with sfas  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the estimated useful lives of el lamp related equipment in durel s us manufacturing facility 
in addition  the reduced forecast of el lamp sales  specifically related to flexible el lamps for the portable communications market  caused us to accelerate the expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with flexible el lamps based on the current forecasted revenues 
we expect to incur additional charges of approximately million in the first quarter of related to these restructuring activities 
flexible circuit materials in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our flexible circuit materials operating segment  which is aggregated into our printed circuit materials reportable segment 
this charge related to the write down of inventory and accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment related to the flexible circuit materials business and was partially offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved for in the second quarter of flexible circuit materials  which are used in a variety of consumer electronic products  have become a commodity product with increased global competition and pricing pressure driven by excess capacity 
this commoditization has caused the operating results of the flexible circuit materials business to significantly decline in recent periods  which resulted in our revaluation of the strategic future viability of this business 
we determined that these market factors were an indicator of impairment that triggered an analysis of the long lived assets related to the flexible circuit materials business in accordance with sfas the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter of closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  concluded that no impairment charge associated with the flexible circuit materials long lived assets was necessary 
as such  in accordance with sfas  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the estimated useful lives of the equipment related to the flexible circuit materials segment 
we also determined  based on business conditions at that time  that certain inventories associated with this business would not be saleable  and we reserved for these inventories accordingly 
we expect to incur minimal charges in the first quarter of related to these restructuring activities 
composite materials in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the composite materials operating segment  which is aggregated into our other polymer products reportable segment 
the operating results of the composite materials business have gradually declined over the past few years 
during the second quarter of  a government program  which was material to the sales and earnings of the composite materials business  expired 
we determined that the loss of this program  which we had previously thought would be replaced with new business  was an indicator of impairment due to the significance of the program on the long term revenues of this business 
consequently  we performed an impairment analysis on the composite materials operating segment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  resulted in us recording an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with this business 
the analysis did not result in the impairment of any of the business other long lived assets 
no additional charges related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the composite materials operating segment were recorded during the remainder of polyester based industrial laminates in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of the goodwill related to the polyester based industrial laminates pbil operating segment  which is aggregated into our other polymer products reportable segment 
this operating segment has historically focused its product offerings in the cable market  which is a market that has become more commodity based with increased competition  and has experienced significant raw material price increases  particularly in copper and aluminum 
over the past few years  we chose to change our strategic focus and long term operational plans to the non cable industry  which we believed would yield higher margins and less competition 
in the second quarter of  a customer notified us that a key program related to a new  emerging technology had been cancelled 
this customer  a major automotive manufacturer  had initially designed our new product into one of its programs  but decided to incorporate a different  less expensive technology into the program instead 
this program was a key strategic initiative related to the long term growth of this operating segment in the non cable industry 
the nature of this product required a design in period of at least a few years in advance of the end product becoming available to consumers  therefore  the cancellation of this program significantly affected the long term forecasts and projections of the business and consequently  the fair value of the business at that time 
we determined that the cancellation of this program was an indicator of impairment due to the significance of the program on the long term revenue and margin growth of this business 
consequently  we performed an impairment analysis on the pbil operating segment under sfas in the previous impairment analysis prepared by us related to the pbil operating segment in the fourth quarter of as part of our annual valuation performed in accordance with sfas  we utilized annual revenue growth rates of approximately  which considered the future sales of this new technology in the program it was designed into at that time 
as a result of the cancellation of the program  we revised our growth projections to approximately annually and also revised our projected margin levels for the revised product mix projections and higher than expected raw material prices 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  resulted in us recording an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with this business 
the analysis did not result in the impairment of any of the business other long lived assets 
severance in  as part of the restructuring activities previously discussed  we took a number of actions to reduce costs  including a company wide headcount reduction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  we recorded million of severance charges in in addition  we made severance payments of million in equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in this was primarily driven by a decline in our flexible circuit joint venture in taiwan  rcct  which is consistent with the results of our wholly owned flexible materials business 
this decline was partially offset by the strong performance of our foam joint ventures in japan and china 
other income expense other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease is primarily related to reduced royalty income as certain royalty agreements expired at the end of and certain one time costs associated with adjusting our legal entity structure in china 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with the restructuring  impairment and other one time charges as well as certain other discrete rate items recorded during the year 
also in  the effective tax rate continued to benefit from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity and general business tax credits 
in  the effective tax rate benefited from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity as well as non taxable foreign sales income and research and general business tax credits 
it is our policy  in accordance with apb  that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
we provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our japanese high performance foams joint venture as well as our taiwanese flexible circuit materials joint venture 
we are eligible for a tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate 
in  the third year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of  resulting in a decrease in our effective tax rate of percentage points 
in  the tax rate in effect will be and will increase each subsequent year until reaching the full rate of in  subject to local government approval 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  we were subject to a rate of tax of in  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of based upon their pretax income of million 
in  the tax rate in effect will be  and will increase each subsequent year until reaching the full rate of in  subject to local government approval 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the increase in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment  as backlog for power distribution components  primarily sold in the ground transportation market  increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end vs 
net sales we experienced record sales in of million  an increase of from the million of sales in the increase in sales is primarily due to an increase in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment from million in to million in as well as slight increases in sales in each of our three other reportable segments 
the factors resulting in these sales increases are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins increased to in from in the increase in margins is primarily attributable to an increase of percentage points in margins in the custom electrical components reportable segment to in from in this increase is primarily driven from the increase in operating leverages due to the sales growth mentioned above  as well as improved production efficiencies  particularly in the new manufacturing operations in china 
manufacturing margins in the high performance foams and printed circuit materials reportable segments were relatively flat year over year 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was driven by additional incentive compensation expense in  primarily related to the increase in sales volume and operating results in  as well as the expensing of stock options and other equity awards as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  in the first quarter of overall selling and administrative expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses decreased slightly in to as compared to in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges in were million as compared to million in the charges were related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the polyester based industrial laminates business 
the charges were for the impairment of certain machinery and equipment associated with our high frequency materials business 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows polyester based industrial laminates in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the polyester based industrial laminates pbil business  which is aggregated into the company s other polymer products reportable segment 
this business has historically focused its product offerings in the cable market  which is a market that has become more commodity based with increased competition  and has experienced significant raw material price increases  particularly in copper and aluminum 
over the past few years  we chose to change our strategic focus and long term operational plans to the non cable industry  which we believed would yield higher margins and less competition 
in the second quarter of  a customer notified us that a key program related to a new  emerging technology had been cancelled 
this customer  a major automotive manufacturer  had initially designed our new product into one of its programs  but decided to incorporate a different  less expensive technology into the program instead 
this program was a key strategic initiative related to the long term growth of this business in the non cable industry 
we are currently evaluating other potential customers for this technology  but it is currently not designed into any specific programs 
the nature of this product requires a design in period of at least a few years in advance of the end product becoming available to consumers  therefore  the cancellation of this program significantly impacted the long term forecasts and projections of the business and consequently  the fair value of the business 
we determined that the cancellation of this program was an indicator of impairment due to the significance of the program on the long term revenue and margin growth of this business 
consequently  we performed an impairment analysis on the pbil business under sfas in the previous impairment analysis prepared in the fourth quarter of as part of our annual valuation performed in accordance with sfas  we utilized annual revenue growth rates of approximately  which considered the future sales of this new technology in the program it was designed into at that time 
as a result of the cancellation of the program  we revised our growth projections to approximately annually and also revised our projected margin levels for the revised product mix projections and higher than expected raw material prices 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process  resulted in recording an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with this business 
the analysis did not result in the impairment of any of the entity s other long lived assets 
at december   the pbil business has a remaining book value of approximately million  comprised primarily of accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets and residual goodwill of approximately million 
high frequency materials in  an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter on certain manufacturing equipment related to the high frequency materials operating segment 
specifically  the charge related to certain idle presses used in the high frequency manufacturing processes 
at the end of  we had no current plan to use the equipment in the near future  therefore  we determined that recording the impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was appropriate 
equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures increased million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the success of rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris  our high performance foams joint venture in suzhou  china 
ris started operations in china in early and experienced operating losses in the first half of that year 
ris began to contribute positively to our results in the fourth quarter of and has continued this positive trend throughout results at our other joint ventures were relatively flat year over year 
other income expense other income increased from million in to million in this increase is attributable primarily to certain charges in which did not recur in  including a million charge for certain environmental remediation matters at our facility in south windham  connecticut and a million charge related to the buy out of certain tenant lease arrangements in our suzhou  china facilities 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in  the effective tax rate benefited from profits generated in jurisdictions with low tax rates as well as non taxable foreign sales income and general business credits 
in  the effective tax rate benefited from non taxable foreign sales income  profits generated in jurisdictions with low tax rates as well as an adjustment to reconcile the tax return as filed in the third quarter of to the year end projections 
it is our policy  in accordance with apb  that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
we provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our japanese high performance foams joint venture as well as our taiwanese flexible circuits material joint venture 
the net deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits available in excess of the expected tax on the undistributed income is entirely offset by a corresponding valuation allowance due to the future uncertainty of the recognition of such credits as they may be limited under the us tax code 
we also claim a us benefit for nontaxable foreign sales income as allowed under the current extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
the world trade organization has upheld a challenge of this regime by the european union and  in response  the us has enacted the american jobs creation act of that repealed eti and created a manufacturers activity deduction 
eti will be phased out by limiting the calculated deduction to in  in and thereafter 
the manufacturing deduction is in the process of being phased in as a deduction on the income from certain qualifying activities in and increasing to a deduction in we have determined that the net effect of these items will not materially affect our tax rate in the short term  but may have an impact  given the nature of our international business  once these changes are fully phased in 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to eti is two percentage points and six percentage points for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to the manufacturers activity deduction is less than one percentage point in both and  respectively 
we are eligible for a tax holiday on our earnings in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations are taxed at a zero percent tax rate 
in  the second year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to the zero percent tax rate  resulting in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate 
in  the tax rate in effect was and it will increase each subsequent year until reaching the full rate of in  subject to local government approval 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  we were subject to a rate of tax of in  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of based upon their pretax income of million 
in  the tax rate in effect will be  and will increase each subsequent year until reaching the full rate of in  subject to local government approval 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at january  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the increase in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment  as backlog for electroluminescent lamps  primarily into the portable handheld communication device market  increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end  in addition to increases in the backlog for other products sold in that segment 
segment sales and operations printed circuit materials dollars in millions net sales operating income our printed circuit materials pcm reportable segment is comprised of flexible and high frequency circuit material products 
net sales in this segment decreased by in as compared to and operating profits declined by approximately million 
these operating results included approximately million of net restructuring charges related to accelerated depreciation on certain equipment used to manufacture flexible circuit materials in the us  an increase in inventory reserves  and severance costs 
for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
the decline in sales and operating profits were primarily driven by reduced sales volumes of flexible circuit material products 
over time  the flexible circuit materials market has become more commoditized as global competition has increased  which has caused pricing pressures partially driven by excess capacity  which has caused our sales volumes and margins to decline 
in an effort to address these issues  we are pursuing alternatives related to these products  including the transfer of production of commodity based flexible circuit material products to our joint venture in taiwan  rcct 
the sales declines experienced in the flexible circuits operating segment were partially offset by an increase in sales in our high frequency products  as we continue to benefit from the satellite television market s addition of new high definition service  and increased penetration into digital applications 
from to  sales in this reportable segment increased by  while operating profits decreased by 
the sales increase was driven by sales into the segment s key strategic end markets cellular communications infrastructure and satellite dishes for television reception 
the decline in operating profits is partially attributed to stock compensation and other incentive compensation costs of million that were recognized in but not in  as well as declining operating results related to our flexible circuit materials products 
custom electrical components dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our custom electrical components cec reportable segment is comprised of the following products electroluminescent lamps  inverters  and power distribution systems products 
net sales in this segment decreased by almost in as compared to  while operating results declined substantially from a profit of million in to a loss of million in the results included net restructuring charges of million  which were comprised of increased inventory reserves  accelerated depreciation related to idle equipment in the us  accelerated expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with certain el lamp product sales  and severance costs 
for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
the sales and operating results declines are primarily driven by the diminishing demand for el backlighting in the portable communications market  as program terminations accelerated at a greater pace than was initially expected 
in order to maximize the residual lamp business  we shifted the majority of el lamp production to china  leaving only a small amount of manufacturing in the u 
s  primarily related to the automotive market 
we believe that the demand for el lamps will continue to lessen in the portable communications market and we are currently exploring other potential opportunities for this technology in advertising  as well as in the automotive and consumer electronics markets  among others 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales and profits in the power distribution systems business  as strong demand for these products helped drive sales in north america  europe  and  particularly  in asia 
in  sales in this segment increased by as compared to and operating results improved by million 
these results were driven primarily by sales of el lamps into the portable handheld communication device market  particularly in cell phone applications 
much of the sales growth was attributable to capacity expansion in china that enabled us to meet the market demand for these products at that time 
sales of our power distribution systems products were also strong as we began to utilize the capacity added in china late in to further penetrate the asian marketplace 
high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income our high performance foams hpf reportable segment is comprised of our poron urethane and bisco silicone foam products 
net sales in this segment increased by approximately in as compared to  while operating profits declined slightly due to an unfavorable sales mix and decreased operating leverage due to declines in production levels of certain products 
this segment continues to perform well with consistent year over year growth driven in by strong demand in the portable communications and transportation markets 
in  we added a second urethane foam manufacturing line in our suzhou  china campus under the management of our ris joint venture in order to better meet customer demand in the asian marketplace 
in  this segment s net sales increased by as compared to  while operating profits declined by 
the sales growth can be attributable to the continued success in the urethane foam product sales  as well as our silicone foam products 
these materials are sold into almost every market segment we serve  and most showed strength in the decline in operating income is primarily attributable to the inclusion of stock compensation and other incentive compensation expense in of million  which was not incurred in other polymer products dollars in millions net sales operating loss our other polymer products opp reportable segment consists of the following products elastomer rollers  floats  non woven materials and polyester based industrial laminates 
net sales in this segment increased slightly from to  while operating results declined 
this segment s results included approximately million in restructuring charges related to the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials business 
for further discussion of these charges  see the restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
in  we formally divested our polyolefin foam operation  which is now classified as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes and is not included in the results presented here 
the sales increase in can be attributable primarily to the strong performance of our polyester based industrial laminates operating segment  offset by the continued decline in our elastomer rollers products 
we continue to evaluate the viability of the product portfolio in this segment as it relates to our long term strategic and operational focus 
in  net sales in this segment increased slightly from million to million while operating results improved dramatically  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improved operating results in are primarily attributable to the increase in sales across the various operating segments that comprise this reportable segment 
joint ventures rogers inoac corporation ric ric  our joint venture with japan based inoac corporation  was established over years ago and manufactures high performance poron urethane foam materials in japan 
sales increased from to and decreased from to the increase experienced in was primarily driven by new lcd gasket design wins in portable communications and electronic games for the domestic japanese market 
rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris ris  our joint venture agreement with inoac corporation for the purpose of manufacturing poron urethane foam materials in china  began operations in sales increased from to and from to the increase experienced in was primarily driven by growth in portable communication applications in taiwan  and solid growth in a broad range of industrial footpad applications 
rogers chang chun technology co  ltd 
rcct rcct  our joint venture with chang chun plastics co  ltd  was established in late to manufacture flexible circuit materials for customers in taiwan 
sales decreased from to and increased from to the decrease experienced in was primarily driven by the overall global decline in the flexible materials market 
this is supported by the sales performance issues also experienced by our wholly owned flex operations  as increased competition and excess global capacity have resulted in similar volume declines 
the increase experienced in was primarily related to continued growth and penetration in the taiwanese flexible circuits market 
polyimide laminate systems  llc pls pls  the company s joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc  sells adhesiveless laminates for trace suspension assemblies 
sales decreased by in as compared to and increased by in as compared to the decrease in is due to end of life and product cycle phase outs of maturing first generation programs and a slight delay in volume production increases of second generation programs 
sales increased slightly in as orders from the joint venture s sole customer increased due to increased market demand for its products 
discontinued operations on july   we completed the closure of the operations of the polyolefin foams operating segment  which had been aggregated in our other polymer products reportable segment 
for the fiscal years ended  and  million of operating income  million of operating loss and million of operating loss  respectively  net of tax  have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  we ceased operations of the polyolefin foams operating segment and there were no net sales associated with the discontinued operations for the second half of see note discontinued operations for further discussion 
product and market development our research and development team is dedicated to growing our businesses by developing cost effective solutions that improve the performance of customers products 
research and development as a percentage of sales was approximately in as compared to in and in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
we introduced a variety of new products during for the newly established thermal management solutions business  we introduced alsic metal matrix composites that provide the high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion needed for applications such as semiconductor package lids and insulated gate bipolar transistor base plates 
an insulated metal substrate material with low thermal impedance was also introduced for applications such as led array packages and intelligent motor controls 
new printed circuit materials included new ro products with lower conductor losses and a new high flow prepreg that provides a broad process window for complex multilayer circuit board manufacturing 
new high performance foam products included thinner mm softseal poron gasketing materials to provide dust seals for the latest generation of thin phones and a new r bak print cushion material designed for use with composite printing sleeves 
a new silicone foam product that meets new european requirements for low smoke  flame and toxicity in mass transit applications was also introduced 
new electroluminescent lamp products included a flexible keypad lamp with higher brightness and efficiency and a new ic driver that is insensitive to the size of the lit area of the keypad 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in the business is one of our fundamental strengths  as demonstrated by our financial position remaining strong throughout we have remained debt free since and continue to finance our operational needs through internally generated funds 
we believe that over the next twelve months  internally generated funds plus available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet the capital expenditures and ongoing financial needs of the business 
however  we continually review and evaluate the adequacy of our lending facilities and relationships 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities at december   december  and january  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively  and working capital of million  million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in significant items that impacted operating cash flows included the following a decrease in inventories of million in as compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the decrease in is the result of the sales declines in the customer electrical components and printed circuit materials reportable segments  as well as a focused effort to reduce inventory levels to improve cash flows and strengthen our working capital position 
a decrease in accounts receivable of million in as compared to an increase of million in and million in the decrease in versus the prior increases in and is evidence of the concentrated collection efforts made in order to strengthen our working capital position 
a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million in as compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the decrease in is primarily attributable to the decrease in raw material purchases related to the decreased production levels which is further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable period as discussed above 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the sale of short term investments during the year  as we had short term investments of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the capital spending was driven by our continuing investment in china  as we continued to build manufacturing capacity in suzhou  china 
cash generated from our operating activities exceeded capital spending in all three years  and spending was financed through these internally generated funds 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and cash used in financing activities of million in the use of cash in and was driven primarily by our stock repurchase program  as million and million were spent to reacquire stock in and  respectively 
we did not repurchase stock in the activity in  of million  is primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of capital stock  as a result of the exercise of stock options 
we  together with certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries  rogers technologies barbados srl  rogers china investment co  ltd  rogers nv  and rogers technologies suzhou co 
ltd 
have a multicurrency revolving credit agreement with citizens bank of connecticut credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for an unsecured five year revolving multi currency credit facility of million credit facility a  and an unsecured day revolving multi currency credit facility of million credit facility b 
the credit agreement includes a letter of credit sub facility of up to million 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the borrowers have the right to incur additional indebtedness through additional borrowings in an aggregate amount of up to million 
credit facility a expires on november  credit facility b was renewed on november   and is expected to be renewed annually 
the rate of interest charged on any outstanding loans can  at the borrower s option and subject to certain restrictions  be based on the prime rate or at rates from to basis points over a libor loan rate 
the spreads over the libor rate are based on our leverage ratio 
under the arrangement  the ongoing commitment fee varies from zero to basis points of the maximum amount that can be borrowed  net of any outstanding borrowings and the maximum amount that beneficiaries may draw under outstanding letters of credit 
in conjunction with the execution of the credit agreement  on november   we terminated an unsecured revolving multi currency credit facility of million prior agreement 
borrowings under the prior agreement were subject to interest based upon the prime rate or a eurocurrency loan rate and required us to pay a commitment fee of to basis points on the maximum borrowings available net of any outstanding borrowings 
there were no borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement at december  and december   respectively 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants primarily related to total indebtedness  interest expense  and capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  and december  additionally  we were obligated under an irrevocable standby letter of credit  which guarantees our self insured workers compensation plan in the amount of million at december  there were no amounts outstanding on this letter of credit as of december  financial position the following discusses the significant fluctuations on our balance sheet at december  as compared to december  decrease in inventories of is the result of our efforts to reduce inventory levels in order to strengthen our working capital position and better align our inventory levels with our expected sales levels 
decrease in accounts receivable of is primarily attributable to our concentrated collection efforts in order to strengthen our working capital position 
decrease in accrued employee benefits and compensation of is a result of the increased annual incentive compensation and commission payouts for  which did not repeat in decrease in accounts payable of is primarily attributable to the decrease in raw material purchases to support current production levels as further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable period as discussed above  as well as the timing of payments at year end 
decrease in additional paid in capital of is primarily related to the stock repurchases that we made during the year 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years operating leases inventory purchase obligations capital commitments pension and retiree health and life insurance benefits total pension benefit payments  which amount to million  are expected to be paid through the utilization of pension plan assets  retiree health and life insurance benefits  which amount to million  are expected to be paid from operating cash flows 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are in the opinion of management reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting standards accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
fin is effective for accounting periods commencing after december  we adopted the provisions of fin on january  upon adoption  an increase of million was recorded in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was recorded through a decrease in retained earnings 
at december   we had gross tax affected unrecognized tax benefits of million  all of which if recognized  would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 
in addition  at december  we have approximately million of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions 
our accounting policy is to account for interest expense and penalties relating to income tax issues as income tax expense 
accounting for fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single definition  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
this statement applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective in the first quarter of  and we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is effective in the first quarter of  and we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believe that appropriate reserves have been established based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances that are known  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used  or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows environmental and product liabilities we accrue for our environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prp s  we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
we are exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
in late  we determined that it was reasonably prudent  based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time  to perform a formal analysis to determine our potential future liability and related insurance coverage for asbestos related matters 
the determination to perform this study was made based on several factors  including the growing number of asbestos related claims and recent settlement history 
projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  our limited claims history and consultations with national economic research associates  inc nera  we believe that five years is the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for future costs  and that costs that might be incurred after that period are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as a result  we also believe that our ultimate net asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields 
the models required us to make numerous assumptions that significantly impacted the results generated by the models 
we believe the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of our asbestos litigation 
the original liability model determined our future liability annually for a year period and was updated at the end of we believe  based on the limited amount of settlement and claims history currently known to us  that a reasonable future time frame to quantify our liability is five years  resulting in a liability at december  of approximately million  which is substantially offset by an insurance receivable of million 
if we were to adjust our assumptions related to the determination of these amounts  the impact of increasing the time frame for projected claims from five years to seven years would be an increase to the liability of million  which we believe would be substantially covered by insurance  conversely  the impact of changing this assumption from five years to three years would be a decrease to the liability of million 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  we plan to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and we will update them if needed based on our experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera s and marsh risk consulting s marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that our accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate our actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that our accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional charges for our asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot estimate such excess amounts at this time 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards to be used in determining the effect of income taxes 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current fiscal year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under sfas and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
inventory allowances we maintain a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on our estimates  and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
we closely monitor the market place and related inventory levels and have historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  we value certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
our obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a basis point adjustment to the december  obsolescence reserve would change the reserve by approximately million 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may have been impaired 
determining the fair value of an operating segment is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under sfas are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of on the three operating segments for which we had goodwill recorded at that time and it did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for these operating segments ranged from approximately million to million 
in order to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each operating segment  which resulted in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately million to million for each respective operating segment 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their market value determined by either a quoted market price  if available  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
although we did not record any impairment charges in related to our property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  we did reduce the useful lives on certain long lived assets primarily related to our flexible materials and durel divisions  as a result of the uncertain future outlook of these segments  which is further evidenced by the restructuring charges taken related to these segments in actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives could differ from those used in calculating the expected future undiscounted cash flows  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired  but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful lives 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide various defined benefit pension plans for our us employees and sponsor three defined benefit healthcare and life insurance plans 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions used were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the citigroup index and  to a lesser extent  the moody s aa bond index  ii the salary growth is based on our historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  market conditions and our expectations of future returns 
the rates used to determine our costs and obligations under our pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in footnote of the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for the year ended december   a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our net benefit cost by approximately million and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when we are made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on our estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of our customer base 
the risk with this estimate is associated with failure to become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  our estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and we have processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
historically over the past three years  our allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a basis point increase in our current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase our allowance reserve by approximately million

words such as expects  anticipates  intends  believes  estimates  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  changing business  economic  and political conditions both in the united states and in foreign countries  increasing competition  changes in product mix  the development of new products and manufacturing processes and the inherent risks associated with such efforts  the outcome of current and future litigation  the accuracy of our analysis of our potential asbestos related exposure and insurance coverage  changes in the availability and cost of raw materials  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and any difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our operations 
such factors also apply to our joint ventures 
we make no commitment to update any forward looking statement or to disclose any facts  events  or circumstances after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statements  unless required by law 
additional information about certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those items described in item a to this form k  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk currently  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risks and manage such risks on specific transactions 
the risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
we have various borrowing facilities where the interest rates  although not fixed  are relatively low 
currently  an increase in the associated interest rates would not significantly impact interest expense on these facilities  as we currently have no debt 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or the related interest income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the size and short term nature of our investment portfolio 
our short term investments are comprised of auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale due to the short term nature of the investment 
however  changes in market conditions could result in us having to hold these investments until maturity  which is typically at least years  thereby negatively impacting our liquidity 
our financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we do business 
our primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing us to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another  however  no such material hedges were outstanding at year end 
we can initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively
