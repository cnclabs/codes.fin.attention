items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and and a 
results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups utilities and non regulated energy previously retail services and wholesale energy  respectively 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment utilities group electric utility electric and gas utility non regulated energy group oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing our utilities business group currently consists of our electric utility  black hills power  and our electric and gas utility  cheyenne light  which was acquired january  black hills power generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming and montana 
cheyenne light serves approximately  electric customers and  natural gas customers in cheyenne  wyoming and vicinity 
our non regulated energy group  which operates through black hills energy and its subsidiaries  engages in the production of natural gas  crude oil and coal primarily in the rocky mountain region  the production of electric power through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under long term tolling contracts  and the marketing of natural gas and crude oil 
industry overview the us energy industry experienced another year of strong economic performance in energy commodity prices continued to be high and volatile 
domestic energy prices continue to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic growth  especially in china and asia  domestic economic growth  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
mild weather dominated the us during most of the year  reducing demand for fuel used for power generation and heating 
minimal hurricane activity allowed for normal gulf of mexico oil and gas production 
at year end  domestic supplies of natural gas in storage were above historical averages 
while the major economic factors affecting energy remained positive in  the political environment changed significantly 
environmental issues took center stage in the us congress in among the topics of emphasis were federally mandated renewable portfolio standards  carbon taxes  carbon cap and trade arrangements  and mandated reductions of greenhouse gas emissions 
although the congress has not yet enacted any major legislation relative to these environmental issues  it appears increasingly likely in the future 
all of these potential legislative actions could have significant macroeconomic consequences 
the associated cost increase would cause a dramatic increase in consumers rates for electricity and other energy in the mid to long term 
state legislatures  too  were very active on the environmental front  with a total of approximately states now having adopted some form of renewable standard  including some where we operate 
the federal and state regulatory climate in  in a general sense  remained relatively constructive among government  industry and consumer representatives 
in the multi state region surrounding our utility operations  regulators were willing to establish rates based on multi year considerations  including fuel and other reasonable cost adjustments  justifiable capital expenditures for maintenance and expansion of energy systems  and a response to environmental considerations through demand management and efficiency programs 
progress in the domestic energy industry in included continued oil and gas exploration and production activity in the rocky mountains  continued planning and construction of liquefied natural gas port facilities  proposals for additional coal fired and nuclear power plants  planning for additional transmission capacity  and the advancement of renewable energy resources and utilization 
of particular note was the regional expansion of natural gas transportation out of colorado  with the completion of the second phase of the rockies express pipeline 
the energy industry continues to adjust to change  including the trends of consolidation in the electric and gas utility sectors  along with asset divestitures to restrict or redefine business strategies 
the energy market place continues to adjust to increased oversight of the ferc and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
in recent years  several state regulatory agencies allowed electric utilities to construct and operate power plants in vertically integrated structures after years of discouraging or prohibiting such activity 
over the last several years  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  in large part due to efforts to create additional shareholder value 
a number of companies are contemplating or implementing a realignment of business lines  reflecting a shift in long term strategies 
some are divesting certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting unregulated power production or oil and gas production in favor of more stable utility operations 
others have engaged in mergers and acquisitions with a goal to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
private equity investors continued to play a role in the changing composition of energy ownership  but to a lesser extent than previous years 
many industry analysts have identified the need for expanded energy capacity and delivery systems 
they foresee an increase in capital investments across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
many electric and gas utilities must replace aging plants and equipment  and regulators appear to be willing to provide acceptable rate treatment for additional utility investment 
oil and gas producers are expected to continue to increase capital spending in response to relatively high prices  particularly for oil 
historically high field service costs  however  have begun to curtail projects as companies more closely examine their economic considerations 
in addition  the process for obtaining drilling permits  particularly on public and native american lands  is getting increasingly more difficult 
in  the domestic coal industry benefited from a positive price environment  in large part due to high and volatile natural gas prices 
coal prices have moderated recently in response to a trend of lower overall natural gas prices  compared to a year ago 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including us allies  advocate reductions in co and other emissions 
many states now encourage the energy industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind or solar power  or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in many instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
furthermore  in the case of california  rules have established a requirement that future imports of power must come from power plants with lower emission levels than currently associated with conventional coal fired plants 
such restrictions may alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
despite these longer term challenges  the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are a small fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
along with similar technological progress  coal can and likely will remain an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
to that point  the us department of energy is beginning to take positive steps toward ensuring the future of coal through research funding for clean coal technologies and methods of carbon capture sequestration 
like other us industries  the energy industry is faced with uncertainties looming on the economic horizon 
a global credit problem emerged from a proliferation of sub prime lending 
as that issue attracted attention  other credit quality concerns surfaced  creating an international scale financial crisis  which could likely take years to resolve 
access to debt markets and capital availability are crucial for a robust and capital intensive energy industry 
another issue facing the us economy is inflation 
as energy companies expand  inflation can impair the ability to manage the costs of lengthy construction projects and other factors 
still another uncertainty is a growing probability of a domestic recession 
utility companies generally are less impacted by economic downturns  but a prolonged or severe recession can affect the demand for energy services and the ability of companies to execute capital expansion plans 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address longer term issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure related matters 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation and efficiency  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over time 
to meet that growing demand  the industry is ready to provide capital  resources and innovation to serve customers in cost effective ways and to achieve returns on investment 
the company believes that it is well positioned in this industry setting and able to proceed with its strategic agenda 
we also believe that we  along with industry counterparts  are ready to address the challenges discussed in this overview  such as new environmental mandates  renewable portfolio standards  carbon related taxes or trading systems  credit market conditions  inflation  or other factors that can affect energy demand and supply 
in particular  we are sensitive to additional costs that can negatively affect our customers or our profitability 
to that end  we intend to work closely with regulators and industry leaders to assure that cost conscious proposals and solutions are prominent in public policy proceedings 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of utility operations  including electric and gas distribution systems  fuel assets and services  including oil  natural gas and coal production and marketing operations  and electric generation operations 
our focus on customers whether utility customers or non regulated generation  fuel or marketing customers provides opportunities to expand our businesses 
our balanced  integrated approach to the energy business is supported by disciplined risk management practices 
the diversity of our operations reduces reliance on any single business to achieve our strategic objectives 
our diversification is expected to provide a measure of stability to our business and financial performance during volatile or cyclical periods 
it helps us reduce our total corporate risk  and allows us to achieve potentially stronger returns over the long term 
we have a strong and stable balance sheet  which is essential given the demands of the market 
we possess access to capital  sufficient liquidity  and solid cash flows and earnings 
consequently  we believe our financial foundation is sound and capable of supporting an expansion of operations in both the near and long term 
related to our long term strategy  our current emphasis is to expand our core utility operations and their power generation assets  while we provide sufficient growth capital for our non regulated fuel  generation and energy marketing operations 
we currently are evaluating the strategic merits of certain of our non regulated power generation assets 
as a result of that evaluation  we may elect to sell some or all of such assets 
our long term strategy focuses on increasing our customer base and providing superior economic and performance value to both utility and non regulated energy customers 
in our utility operations  we seek to grow our existing asset base through construction of new rate based generation facilities  and by adding new customers through the acquisition of additional utility properties 
we intend to maintain our high customer service and reliability standards 
in our fuel production operations  we will continue to economically grow and develop our existing inventory of oil and gas reserves  while we strive to maintain our positive relationships with mineral owners  landowners and regulatory authorities 
we seek to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
our non regulated power generation business will continue to focus on long term contractual relationships with key wholesale customers  as well as new customers that will allow us to selectively grow our power generation business  while evaluating the strategic merits of certain of our existing facilities 
the expertise of our energy marketing business should allow us to continue to provide profitability through a risk managed and disciplined approach to producer service  origination  storage  transportation and proprietary marketing strategies 
the following are key elements of our business strategy operate our lines of business as utility and non regulated energy components 
the utility component consists of electric and natural gas products and services 
the non regulated energy component consists of fuel production  mid stream assets  power production facilities and energy marketing  expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  complete our proposed acquisition of certain aquila owned utility assets and successfully integrate and profitably operate our expanded utility operations  plan  invest in  construct and expand our rate base generation to serve our electric utilities  proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while remaining mindful of potential customer rate impacts  selectively grow our power generation segment by developing assets in targeted western markets  while evaluating the strategic merits of certain of our existing assets  sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from our non regulated power generation projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers  efficiently utilize our coal resources through expansion of mine mouth generation and increased third party coal sales  grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil  geographically expand our energy marketing operations including producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by market conditions  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities  diligently manage the risks inherent in energy marketing  and conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties 
operate our lines of business as utility and non regulated energy components 
the utility component consists of electric and natural gas products and services 
the non regulated energy component consists of fuel production  mid stream assets  power production facilities and energy marketing 
we partition operations into utility and non regulated energy business groups to achieve operating efficiencies 
in the utilities group  the integration of customer service  marketing and promotional efforts streamline operating processes and improve productivity 
in the non regulated energy group  the fuel production  generation and marketing segments integrate balanced  yet diverse strategic operations 
expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for years  we and our predecessor companies have provided strong utility services  based on delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment is expected to support efforts to expand our utility operations into other markets  most likely in the midwest  west and possibly other regions that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service and a relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the acquisition of cheyenne light and the pending acquisition of certain electric and gas utility assets of aquila are examples of such expansion efforts 
utility operations also enhance other important business development  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other non regulated energy operations 
utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
complete our proposed acquisition of certain aquila owned utility assets and successfully integrate and profitably operate our expanded utility operations 
our pending acquisition of aquila s five utility properties in four states will significantly expand our regional presence and the size and scope of our utility operations 
we believe that the expanded utility operations will enhance our ability to serve customers and communities and build long term value for our shareholders 
in addition to other customary conditions  the completion of the transaction requires us to obtain state and federal regulatory approvals  and pass federal antitrust review 
as of february   we received approvals from regulators in the states of iowa  nebraska and colorado  obtained federal antitrust clearance  and received ferc approval of the colorado electric property acquisition 
on february   a hearing was held by the kansas corporation commission on our joint application with aquila 
all the parties to the kansas proceeding entered into a settlement which was presented at that hearing 
a decision by the kansas regulators is pending 
in addition  another party to the transaction  great plains energy  must obtain approval from regulators in the states of missouri and kansas  which are pending 
we will require access to the capital markets to secure capital sufficient to fund our acquisition 
we have obtained a billion temporary financing arrangement with a termination date of february  in the interim  we intend to obtain permanent financing for the transaction from a variety of sources  including equity  mandatory convertible securities  corporate level debt or cash from operations or the potential divestiture of certain non regulated power plant assets 
access to capital markets could be impacted by our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
we expect that the acquisition will result in multiple benefits after a period of transition and integration costs 
we will strive to integrate our current and acquired utility operations to achieve these anticipated benefits 
plan  invest in  construct and expand our rate base generation to serve our electric utilities 
our company s original business was a vertically integrated electric utility 
this business model remains a core strength and strategy today  where we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable and stable rates to our customers and earn solid returns for our investors 
rate based generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  the assets assure consumers that rates have been reviewed and approved by government authorities who safeguard the public interest 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors by lowering our cost of capital 
examples of our progress include the recent start up of commercial operations at wygen ii  and the ongoing permitting and development of wygen iii 
in  we submitted to regulators an integrated resource plan and applied for an industrial siting permit and a certificate of public convenience and necessity for wygen iii 
the industrial siting permit was obtained in january the certificate is pending with hearings scheduled to begin during march once the certificate is obtained  we expect to commence construction of wygen iii in the spring of proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while remaining mindful of potential customer rate impacts 
the energy and utility industries are faced with a tremendous amount of uncertainty related to the potential impact of legislation intended to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources 
to date  many states have enacted and others are considering some form of mandatory renewable energy standard requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds for the use of renewable energy 
additionally  many states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets 
federal legislation for both renewable energy standards and greenhouse gas emission reductions are also under consideration 
any significant mandate for renewable energy supplies or greenhouse gas emission reductions would likely increase prices for electricity and natural gas considerably 
the company s strategy related to renewable energy standards and greenhouse gas emission reductions is customer centered and attempts to balance our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations 
as a regulated public utility  we are responsible for providing safe  reasonably priced  reliable sources of energy to our customers 
absent any specific renewable energy standard in south dakota and wyoming  our current strategy is to prudently incorporate renewable energy into our resource supply  while seeking to minimize rate increases for our utility customers 
we have executed a year purchase power agreement commencing in september for mw of wind energy resources to be located in cheyenne  wyoming 
we are exploring other potential biomass and wind energy projects  and are evaluating other potential wind generator sites  including sites located near our utility service territories 
using reasonable assumptions  we have carefully evaluated our coal fired generating facilities and the potential future economic impact of a carbon tax or cap and trade regime intended to reduce co emissions 
based on current assumptions  we believe it is in our utility customers long term interest to construct new mine mouth  coal fired generating facilities  such as our recently completed wygen ii generation facility and our proposed wygen iii generation facility 
we are also evaluating alternative coal fired generation technologies  including igcc and carbon capture and sequestration  though both appear cost prohibitive in the near term 
selectively grow our power generation segment by developing assets in targeted western markets  while evaluating the strategic merits of certain of our existing assets 
we aim to continue developing and operating power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and fuel and energy marketing capabilities 
this approach seeks to capitalize on market growth while managing our fuel procurement needs 
we intend to grow through a combination of disciplined acquisitions and development of new power generation facilities primarily in the western regions where we believe we have the detailed knowledge of market fundamentals and competitive advantage to achieve attractive returns 
our emphasis is to pursue small scale build outs to serve incremental growth  and improve the likelihood of receiving approvals for permitting and siting 
in  we began construction of another independent power plant to provide capacity and energy to public service company of new mexico under a year tolling arrangement 
that plant is expected to be in commercial service in june we believe that existing sites with opportunities for brownfield expansion generally offer the potential for greater returns than development of new sites through a greenfield strategy 
brownfield sites typically offer several competitive advantages over greenfield development  including proximity to existing transmission systems  operating cost advantages related to ownership of shared facilities  a less costly and time consuming permitting process  and potential ability to reduce capital requirements by sharing infrastructure with existing facilities at the same site 
we expanded our capacity with brownfield development at our valmont and wyodak sites in  arapahoe and las vegas sites in and our wyodak site in we believe that our wyodak  fountain valley and harbor sites in particular provide further opportunities for significant expansion of our gas and coal fired generating capacity over the next several years 
in  we initiated an evaluation of the merits of divesting certain power generation assets 
that strategic review is ongoing as of february  while much of our recent power plant development has been for regulated utilities  we may continue to expand our non regulated power generation business with select projects that are consistent with our overall strategies 
sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from our non regulated power generation projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns 
the majority of our energy and capacity is provided under mid and long term contracts 
by doing so  we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
our goal is to sell a majority of our unregulated power generation under long term  utility commission reviewed or approved contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
the first of our long term power contracts expires in  and nearly all expire before these contract arrangements are presently under evaluation for renewal or extension  with or without potential revisions to the basic terms of the existing agreements 
most of the existing contracts have been reviewed by regulatory agencies 
our power plants  particularly in wyoming  the front range of colorado  las vegas  nevada and long beach  california are sited in regions of moderate to rapid population and load growth 
they are also located to provide advantageous  convenient access to both fuel supply and power transmission 
in anticipation of renewal or extension  a contract review process generally begins about two years in advance of expiration  and we would expect to proceed accordingly 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins 
we expect to selectively expand our portfolio of power plants having relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
we intend to utilize a competitive power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to protect our revenue stream 
competitive production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
in addition  we typically operate our plants with high levels of availability  as compared to national standards 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving low production costs 
a primary competitive advantage is our coal mine  which is located in close proximity to our retail service territories 
we are exploiting the competitive advantage of this native fuel source by building additional mine mouth coal fired generating capacity 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer since transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal for many other utilities 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers 
we strive to build strong relationships with utilities  municipalities and other wholesale customers and believe we will continue to be a primary provider of electricity to wholesale utility customers 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to serve their customers reliably 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to meet our customers energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
efficiently utilize our coal resources through expansion of mine mouth generation and increased third party coal sales 
our primary strategy is to expand our coal production through the construction of mine mouth coal fired generation plants at our wrdc coal mine location 
our objective is to develop coal production operations to serve our mine mouth coal fired generation plants directly 
we also plan to pursue future sales of coal to additional regional rail served and truck served customers 
recently  we renegotiated a contract to provide coal for the dave johnston power plant in wyoming and extended the term through grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil 
our strategy is to increase both reserves and production through a combination of drilling and acquisitions 
primary emphasis will be placed on developing our existing core properties located in the san juan  piceance and powder river basins 
specifically  we plan to increase our reserves primarily by focusing our operations on lower risk development and exploratory drilling  participate on a non operated basis through taking working interests with other similar scale operators to provide exposure to additional producing basins  add reserves and increase production by focusing primarily on various plays in the rocky mountain region  where the added production can be integrated with our existing oil and natural gas operations as well as our fuel marketing and or power generation activities  support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a substantial portion of our established production for up to years in the future  and enhance our oil and gas production activities with the construction or acquisition of mid stream gathering  compression and treating systems in a manner that maximizes the economic value of our operations 
geographically expand our energy marketing operations including producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by market conditions  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities 
our energy marketing business seeks to provide services to producers and end users of natural gas and crude oil and to capitalize on market volatility by employing storage  transportation and proprietary trading strategies 
the service provider focus of our energy marketing activities largely differentiates us from other energy marketers 
through our producer services group  we assist mostly small to medium sized producers throughout the western us with marketing and transporting their natural gas 
through our origination services  we work with utilities  municipalities and industrial users of natural gas to provide customized delivery services  as well as to support their efforts to optimize their transportation and storage positions 
diligently manage the risks inherent in energy marketing 
our energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we have implemented risk management policies and procedures for our marketing operations 
we have oversight committees that monitor compliance with our policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining credit facilities separate from our corporate facility 
conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties 
all our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee 
prospective information we expect long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continual capital deployment 
we are strategically positioned to take advantage of opportunities to acquire and develop energy assets consistent with our investment criteria and a prudent capital structure 
utilities electric utility business at our electric utility  black hills power  remained strong in we believe that black hills power will produce modest growth in revenue  and absent unplanned plant outages  continue to produce stable earnings for the next several years 
we forecast firm energy sales in our retail service territory to increase over the next years at an annual compound growth rate of approximately one to two percent  with the system demand forecasted to increase at a rate of one to two percent 
these forecasts are derived from studies we conducted  whereby we examined and analyzed our service territory to estimate changes in the needs for electrical energy and demand over a year period 
these forecasts are only estimates  and the actual changes in electric sales may be substantially different 
weather deviations can also affect energy sales significantly when compared to forecasts based on normal weather 
the portion of the utility s future earnings that will result from wholesale off system sales will depend on many factors  including regulatory requirements  native load growth  plant availability and electricity demand and commodity prices in not only our service territory  but in the surrounding power markets as well 
in  we plan to begin construction of wygen iii  a mw coal fired power plant to be located at our neil simpson complex 
we have received the required air permit and industrial siting permit  with the last regulatory step  obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the state of wyoming  set for hearing on march  upon obtaining this permit  we would commence construction 
we anticipate that black hills power will have mw of the facilities capacity and are considering third party investors to own the remaining mw 
electric and gas utility we acquired cheyenne light in january on january   wygen ii  a mw baseload coal fired power plant commenced commercial service as a rate base asset to serve cheyenne light 
the plant cost approximately million  including interim financing costs during construction 
effective january   a regulatory approved agreement between the affiliates gives cheyenne light the ability to sell its surplus energy to black hills power 
in addition  we entered into a year contract to purchase up to mw of renewable wind power  beginning in september the energy from this contract can be utilized by both cheyenne light and black hills power 
we expect system demand in the cheyenne  wyoming vicinity over the next years to increase at an annual compound rate of approximately two percent 
pending acquisition on february   we announced an agreement with aquila to purchase utility assets 
if completed  the acquisition will dramatically increase the size and scope of our utilities group 
through the transaction  we will acquire the assets of aquila s regulated electric utility in colorado and their regulated gas utilities in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa 
the transaction would add approximately  new utility customers  electric customers and  gas customers to our current customer base 
the regulatory approval process is progressing 
as of february   approvals have been received from the states of iowa  nebraska and colorado  federal antitrust clearance was obtained under the hart scott rodino act  and ferc has approved of the colorado electric acquisition 
on february   a hearing was held by the kansas corporation commission on our joint application with aquila 
all the parties to the kansas proceeding entered into a settlement which was presented at that hearing 
a decision by the kansas regulators is pending 
in addition  our purchase of these utility assets is cross contingent with the merger of great plains energy and aquila  whose remaining assets would be in the state of missouri 
great plains energy must obtain regulatory approvals in the states of missouri and kansas  which are pending 
to prepare for the acquisition  we have been expensing certain temporary transition and integration costs as they have occurred  amounting to approximately million after tax  for the year ended december  in addition  we have capitalized certain costs relating to the acquisition  amounting to approximately million  as of december  the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of the company expects the acquisition to be dilutive to earnings in the first full year of operations 
the purchase price of million is expected to be financed through a combination of equity  corporate level debt  mandatory convertible securities  and internally generated cash  which could include cash proceeds from the potential divestiture of certain non regulated power plant assets 
non regulated energy group power generation earnings from our power generation segment in will benefit from commercial operation of the valencia plant beginning in the summer of this will be partially offset by a decrease in earnings and cash flows associated with our receipt from sce of contract termination payments for the harbor facility  which will be completed in october we are conducting a strategic review of our assets within this segment  which may result in the divestiture of certain of our non regulated power generation assets 
such divestiture would  of course  result in a reduction of future earnings and cash flows  offset initially by any potential gain on sale and ultimately by alternative use of the sale proceeds 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment is expected to primarily serve mine mouth generation plants and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
increased demand will come from additional mine mouth generation either currently being constructed or in various stages of development 
a contract to provide coal to pacificorp s dave johnston power plant was renegotiated in late beginning in  it provides for the sale of up to million tons of coal annually through previous coal sales to the plant ranged from million tons to million tons during previous contract years through deliveries to the wygen ii power plant began in late the demand from the new dave johnston and wygen ii contracts is expected to result in a production increase of approximately million tons annually 
total annual production is estimated to be approximately million tons in  compared to million tons in and million tons in and we expect lower earnings from this segment in  as higher revenues from production and coal price increases is offset by higher operating expenses 
operating cost increases will be driven by higher labor and equipment costs as overburden ratios and production levels increase 
non operating income will also decrease as a result of recapitalizing our coal mining subsidiary 
oil and gas we expect that earnings from this segment over the next few years will be driven primarily by increased oil and gas production 
our long term compounded annual production growth target is to percent 
recent results  which have not attained expected performance  reflected weakened economic conditions caused by rapidly increasing capital costs and operating expenses 
consequently  we elected to reduce our drilling program in as economic conditions merit  we may elect to increase our drilling and production activity 
near term growth is expected to come from development of our acquisitions in the piceance basin and the ongoing development of the san juan  powder river and williston basins 
we expect to deploy approximately million of capital in developing our current properties 
we will continue our focus on optimal deployment of capital as drilling and completion costs are expected to continue to rise due to persistent shortages in the industry 
our drilling program is focused on both proved reserves and the further delineation of existing fields  including development of additional locations in the san juan  piceance and powder river basins 
in addition  we may invest in mid stream assets  such as gathering  compression and treating systems 
energy marketing we expect lower earnings from this segment in  as earnings were strong due to unusually favorable natural gas market conditions 
a new natural gas pipeline providing expanded transportation services out of the rocky mountain region may affect market conditions and the opportunity to effectively exploit certain regional price basis differentials 
continued market volatility will enable us to extract economic value as we look to expand our business 
we will continue to focus on producer  end use origination  and gas storage and transportation services and a regional wholesale marketing strategy 
this will be done while maintaining our conservative credit management and lower risk profile that emphasizes short term physical transactions 
results of operations executive summary results for the year reflect solid utility performance  strong energy marketing results and improved power generation and coal mining performance  while the oil and gas segment results were similar to earnings for the utilities increased percent over the prior year 
a rate increase for black hills power s south dakota service territory went into effect january  results for cheyenne light were impacted by increased afudc income attributable to the mw coal fired wygen ii plant which was placed in commercial service january  in november  the wpsc approved a new rate structure for cheyenne light and included the wygen ii plant in the rate base effective january  strong earnings from energy marketing are primarily attributable to a million increase in realized gas marketing margins 
earnings benefited from favorable natural gas market conditions that prevailed throughout daily average physical gas volumes marketed increased percent over this segment also reflects oil marketing operations in the rocky mountain region for the full year in power generation improved earnings for as the las vegas plants were returned to normal operations after extensive repairs and maintenance in for scheduled and unscheduled outages 
earnings were also impacted by a million after tax impairment charge for the ontario plant and million after tax for a goodwill impairment 
lower investment partnership earnings were primarily a result of a partnership impairment charge for the glenns ferry and rupert power plants in which we hold a percent interest 
the impairments reduced our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries by approximately million after tax 
oil and gas segment earnings were similar to the previous year 
a percent increase in revenues was offset by increased operating  depletion and interest costs 
coal mining earnings increased due to higher average prices received and increased tons of coal sold partially offset by increased overburden expense and higher mineral taxes and royalties due to increased revenues and tons sold 
overview revenue and income loss from continuing operations provided by each business group were as follows in thousands revenue utilities non regulated energy corporate income loss from continuing operations utilities non regulated energy corporate the corporate results represent unallocated costs for administrative activities that support the business segments 
corporate also includes business development activities that do not fall under the two business groups 
on january   we completed the acquisition of cheyenne light  an electric and natural gas utility serving customers in cheyenne  wyoming and vicinity 
the results of operations of cheyenne light have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
discontinued operations in  and represents the operations and gain on sale of our crude oil marketing and transportation business  sold in march in addition to the houston  texas based crude oil marketing and transportation operations  the discontinued operations also include our communications segment  black hills fibersystems  inc  which was sold in june  and our mw pepperell power plant  which was sold in april results of operations for have been restated to reflect the operations discontinued 
compared to consolidated income from continuing operations for was million  compared to million in  or per share in  compared to per share in loss from discontinued operations was million  or per share  compared to income of million  or per share in results for include the million gain on the sale of the operating assets of the crude oil marketing and transportation business 
return on average common stock equity in and was percent and percent  respectively 
the utilities group income from continuing operations increased million in compared to earnings from continuing operations from the electric utility increased million primarily due to an increase in retail rates 
earnings from continuing operations from the electric and gas utility increased million primarily due to afudc and associated tax benefits related to the construction of wygen ii 
the non regulated energy group s income from continuing operations increased million in  compared to  primarily due to increased earnings from energy marketing of million and power generation of million 
unallocated corporate costs for increased million after tax  compared to the increase is primarily due to increased acquisition and integration costs for the aquila acquisition offset by lower interest expense which was allocated down to the subsidiary level in consolidated revenues for were million higher than due to increased revenues from all operating segments  other than the electric and gas utility which had lower revenues primarily due to lower eca and gca pass through cost recovery rate adjustments 
we consider gross margin to be a more useful performance measure for the electric and gas utility as fluctuations in cost of electricity and gas flow through to revenues through cost recovery rate adjustments 
consolidated operating expenses for increased million compared to increased operating expenses reflect a million impairment charge at our power generation segment  increased compensation costs at the energy marketing segment  a million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  primarily due to increased depletion at the oil and gas segment  and a million increase in operations and maintenance expense 
the increased expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in fuel and purchased power primarily due to cost recovery adjustments at the electric and gas utility 
the increase in operations and maintenance expense was partially offset by the receipt of million of insurance proceeds as a reimbursement for repair costs incurred in on the las vegas ii plant 
income from continuing operations was also impacted by a million decrease in interest expense primarily due to the reduction of debt  using in part  proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock  and the effect of interest capitalization during ongoing construction and development 
compared to consolidated income from continuing operations for was million  compared to million in  or per share in  compared to per share in income from discontinued operations  including the million gain on the sale of the operating assets of the crude oil marketing and transportation business  was million or per share in  compared to income of million or per share in return on average common stock equity in and was percent and percent  respectively 
income from continuing operations for our utilities group increased million in compared to earnings from continuing operations from the electric utility increased million and earnings from continuing operations from the electric and gas utility  acquired january   increased million primarily due to lower write offs for bad debt and  afudc and related tax effects  related to the wygen ii plant 
the non regulated energy group s income from continuing operations increased million in compared to increased earnings from power generation of million and from energy marketing of million were offset by decreased earnings of million at our oil and gas operations and million from coal mining operations 
earnings at the power generation segment increased due primarily to a million impairment charge in unallocated corporate costs for the year ended december  decreased million after tax  compared to the decrease is primarily due to increased allocations of corporate costs and interest expense down to the subsidiary level and the write off of approximately million after tax of certain capitalized project development costs and the expensing of other development costs  which are included in administrative and general operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
consolidated operating expenses for decreased million compared to decreased operating expenses reflect the million impairment charge at our power generation segment in offset by a million increase in fuel and purchased power  a million increase in depreciation expense and a million increase in operations and maintenance 
higher fuel and purchased power costs were primarily the result of the increased cost of sales of electricity and gas at cheyenne light  which was acquired during  partially offset by lower purchased power costs at black hills power 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is primarily due to higher depletion at the oil and gas segment 
increased operations and maintenance expense is primarily related to scheduled and unscheduled plant outages  partially offset by the receipt of million of insurance proceeds for repairs on the las vegas ii plant in a discussion of operating results from our business segments follows

partially offsetting the increases to earnings was the following fuel expense increased percent due to increased coal prices and the use of higher cost gas generation to meet demand requirements 
compared to income from continuing operations increased percent primarily due to retail sales increased percent and contract wholesale sales increased percent  purchased power costs decreased primarily due to a percent lower average costs per mwh  partially offset by an percent increase in mwh purchased  and decreased power marketing legal costs relative to costs incurred in partially offsetting the earnings increases were the following wholesale off system sales decreased percent due to an percent decrease in average price received  partially offset by an percent increase in mwh sold  increased fuel costs primarily due to a percent increase in average cost of steam generation and increased gas generation utilized for firm load demand and peaking needs due to scheduled and unscheduled outages at the wyodak plant and warmer weather  increased repairs and maintenance costs for the wyodak plant  and a higher effective tax rate due to the recording in of a deferred tax benefit adjustment of million rate increase settlement 
in december  we received an order from the sdpuc  effective january   approving a percent increase in retail rates and the addition of tariff provisions for automatic cost adjustments 
the cost adjustments require the electric utility to absorb a portion of power cost increases partially depending on earnings from certain short term wholesale sales of electricity 
absent certain conditions  the order also restricts black hills power from requesting an increase in base rates that would go into effect prior to january  our previous rate structure  in place since  did not contain fuel or purchased power adjustment clauses and only provided the ability to request rate relief from energy costs in certain defined situations

we consider gross margin to be a more useful performance measure as fluctuations in cost of electricity and gas flow through to revenues through cost recovery rate adjustments 
income from continuing operations increased percent due to the following a million decrease in depreciation expense due to lower rates as the result of a depreciation study  a million decrease in the write off of uncollectible accounts  and a lower effective income tax rate due to a million tax credit and permanent differences related to afudc on the wygen ii power plant 
these items were partially offset by increased administrative expense for rate case costs and professional fees  and a million increase in interest expense due to increased borrowings  net of the capitalized interest component of afudc 
compared to the period january  to december  income from continuing operations was million in compared to million in due to the following gross margin increased percent primarily due to an increase in base rates  a percent increase in electric demand and an percent increase in gas demand  a full year of operations in as compared to  and increased income from afudc associated with the construction of the wygen ii power plant 
partially offsetting the earnings increases was the following increased operating expense of percent primarily due to increased depreciation expense  the write off of uncollectible accounts and increases due to a full year of operations in rate increase in november  the wpsc approved general rate increases of million for electric rates and million for natural gas rates to provide for increased costs of providing service 
the allowed rate of return on equity is percent based on a capital structure that is percent equity and percent debt 
in addition  the electric rate increase includes placing the megawatt  coal fired wygen ii power plant into rate base 
the wpsc also approved a new pass through mechanism for cheyenne light s electric business

davis associates  inc in and reserves were determined using constant product prices at the end of the respective years 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables  which may differ from actual results 
the current estimate takes into account production of approximately bcfe  additions from extensions and discoveries of bcfe and revisions to previous estimates of bcfe 
reserves reflect year end pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas year end prices nymex year end prices average well head compared to income from continuing operations was comparable to the prior year 
revenues from oil and gas sales increased percent due to a percent increase in oil volumes at average prices received that were percent higher than prior year and increased gas sales of percent  at a percent higher average gas price received  operations and maintenance costs increased percent due to increases in the number of wells and higher industry costs for services and equipment  general and administrative costs increased percent primarily due to higher corporate allocations and increased labor costs resulting from staffing increases to support development of acquisitions  depletion per mcfe increased percent primarily due to increases in current year finding costs and forecasted future development costs and higher industry wide cost increases  and interest expense increased percent due to carrying a full year of piceance basin acquisition debt and increased borrowings to fund drilling and exploration activity 
compared to income from continuing operations decreased percent due to the following increased loe of percent primarily due to generally higher field service costs experienced industry wide and san juan compression costs  the east blanco amine plant costs and operating costs associated with compression and gas treatment for the piceance basin properties  a percent increase in the depletion rate  which reflects higher industry wide drilling and completion costs that significantly increased estimated future development costs in addition to increased costs from acquisitions and lower reserve estimates  and increased federal royalties as a result of expiring royalty relief on stripper wells 
partially offsetting the earnings decreases was the following revenues from oil and gas increased percent due to a percent increase in gas volumes sold due to increased production from recently completed wells and property acquisitions and a percent increase in oil volumes due to increased drilling activity in the finn shurley field at a percent increase in average price received 
on march   we acquired certain oil and gas assets of koch exploration company  llc 
the assets included approximately bcfe of proved reserves  including approximately bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves which are substantially all gas  and associated midstream and gathering assets

the following table provides certain operating statistics for the power generation segment independent power capacity mw of independent power capacity in service contracted fleet plant availability gas fired plants coal fired plants total compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to the following increased earnings from las vegas ii due to a full year of operations as compared to in which the plant incurred outages 
the increased earnings were partially offset by increased variable costs due to the higher run times 
insurance proceeds of approximately million were received as a reimbursement for the plant repairs and reduced operation and maintenance costs  and decreased interest expense due to debt reductions and lower interest rates 
partially offsetting the earnings increase were the following decreased earnings from las vegas i due to increased fuel prices and increased variable operations and maintenance costs relative to due to the plant outage  and decreased earnings of approximately million after tax due to the impairment of the ontario plant  and decreased equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately million after tax due to the partnership impairment charge for the glenns ferry and rupert power plants in which we hold a percent interest 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million primarily due to the following higher capacity revenue at our harbor facility due to a three year  year round tolling agreement  which commenced april  and replaced a seasonal contract  lower variable operating costs at the las vegas i and las vegas ii facilities due to scheduled and unscheduled outages  operating expense in includes a million impairment charge on the las vegas i power plant  a million impairment of goodwill related to certain power fund investments and a million charge related to a fuel contract termination  and the recording in of a million charge for a tax adjustment 
partially offsetting the earnings increase were the following increased repairs and maintenance expense related to the las vegas ii power plant outages  net of million of related insurance proceeds received in  an million after tax decrease in earnings from certain power fund investments  and increased interest expense due to higher interest rates 
plant availability of our contracted fleet in and was affected by the planned maintenance at las vegas i and unplanned outages at las vegas ii

coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the coal mining segment thousands of tons tons of coal sold coal reserves compared to income from continuing operations increased percent due to the following a percent increase in revenues primarily due to increases in coal pricing  sales in december to the wygen ii plant for test power  which was placed into commercial service january   and lower revenues in due to scheduled and unscheduled outages at the wyodak plant 
partially offsetting the increased revenues and earnings were the following increased overburden removal costs due to a percent increase in cubic yards moved  increased royalty expense primarily due to the increase in revenues  and increased mining taxes primarily related to the increase in revenues and tons 
compared to income from continuing operations decreased percent due to the following increased overburden expense due to a change in accounting rules requiring overburden removal to be expensed as incurred  higher depreciation expense  and higher mineral taxes primarily resulting from increased production and severance taxes due to state of wyoming audit adjustments 
partially offsetting the earnings decrease were the following increased revenues of percent primarily due to higher average prices received  and increased train load out sales  although these were substantially offset by decreased sales to the wyodak power plant due to scheduled and unscheduled outages

partially offsetting the earnings increase was the following increased tax expense for higher estimated occupation taxes  and increased compensation costs related to higher realized marketing margins 
ferc compliance investigation during  following an internal review of natural gas marketing activities conducted within the non regulated energy group  the company identified possible instances of noncompliance with regulatory requirements applicable to those activities 
the company has notified the staff of ferc of its findings 
the company has also evaluated recent public announcements of civil penalties ranging from million to million that have been levied against other companies for violations of ferc regulatory requirements 
we believe we have adequately reserved for the estimated potential penalty that could be levied on the company 
although the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings resulting from these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty  the final resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the consolidated net income of any particular period  but is not expected to have a material impact upon the company s overall consolidated financial position 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to the following realized gross margins from gas marketing increased million over the prior year and physical gas volumes marketed increased percent  additional margins from oil marketing operations beginning in may  and lower professional fees as compared to cost incurred in related to litigation involving class action lawsuits alleging false reporting of natural gas price and volume information see note 
partially offsetting the earnings increase was the following gas marketing unrealized mark to market losses were million higher  increased compensation costs related to higher realized marketing margins  and increased bad debt provision 
in march  we sold the operating assets of our houston  texas based crude oil marketing and transportation business 
beginning with the first quarter of  the operations of this business were classified as discontinued operations 
subsequent to the sale of the crude oil marketing and transportation assets  enserco  our natural gas marketing subsidiary  began marketing crude oil in the rocky mountain region out of our golden  colorado offices 
our primary strategy involves executing physical crude oil purchase contracts with producers  and reselling into various markets 
these transactions are primarily entered into as back to back purchases and sales  effectively locking in a marketing fee equal to the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  less transportation costs 
under sfas  mark to market accounting for the related commodity contracts in our back to back strategy results in an acceleration of marketing margins locked in for the term of the contracts 
these are generally short term contracts with automatic renewals if there is no notice of cancellation

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note  business description and summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
although we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
during september  the company assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of the ontario power plant due to the pending thermal host contract expiration without a long term extension 
the carrying amount of the assets tested for impairment was million 
the assessment resulted in an impairment charge of million  primarily for net property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
this charge reflects the amount by which the carrying value of the facility exceeded its estimated fair value determined by its estimated future discounted cash flows 
in addition  million has been accrued for a contract termination payment and other related costs 
during december  the company recorded a million pre tax impairment of goodwill related to the anticipated inability to recover our investment in the glenns ferry and rupert power plants 
these plants are held in limited partnerships in which we hold a percent interest and are accounted for under the equity method 
the partnerships impaired the associated long lived assets during during the third quarter of  in accordance with our accounting policies  we evaluated for impairment the long lived asset carrying values of our las vegas i power plant 
the evaluation for impairment was prompted by plant operating losses driven by high natural gas prices 
natural gas prices were mmbtu nymex on september   and were forecasted to maintain historically high price levels 
in measuring the fair value of the las vegas i power plant and the resulting impairment charge of approximately million pre tax  we considered a number of possible cash flow models associated with the various probable operating assumptions and pricing for the capacity and energy of the facility 
we then made our best determination of the relative likelihood of the various models in computing a weighted average expected cash flow for the facility 
inclusion of other possible cash flow scenarios and or different weighting of those that were included could have led to different conclusions about the fair value of the plant 
further  the weighted average cash flow method is sensitive to the discount rate assumption 
if we had used a discount rate that was percent higher  the resulting impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
if the discount rate would have been percent lower  the impairment charge would have been approximately million lower 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off goodwill of approximately million  net of accumulated amortization of million  related to partnership equity flips at certain power fund investments 
as these funds follow accounting policies which require their plant investments to be carried at fair value  our goodwill represented an excess investment cost in the funds that was only supported by the value of the potential increased partnership equity 
when the equity flip was triggered by performance thresholds being met  the value of the additional partnership interest was recognized and our related goodwill impaired 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas prices at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
although our net capitalized costs were less than the full cost ceiling at december   we can provide no assurance that a write down in the future will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
in addition  we annually rely on an independent consulting and engineering firm to verify the estimates we use to determine the amount of our proved reserves and those estimates are based on a number of assumptions about variables 
we can provide no assurance that these assumptions will not differ significantly from actual results 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil and gas prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated units of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
the net book value of our oil and gas properties is also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
the estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves have been reviewed annually by independent petroleum engineers 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note risk management activities  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas accounting for derivatives under sfas requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement at fair value 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into at our oil and gas exploration and production segment to fix the price received for anticipated future production and for interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt  or associated variable rate interest payments  to a fixed rate 
our marketing and trading operations utilize various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage our marketing and trading portfolios 
fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
counterparty credit risk we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit and tenor limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current financial information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
those assumptions  as further described in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels and healthcare costs 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity and fixed income investments 
target long term investment allocations consist of percent equities and percent fixed income securities 
fluctuations in actual market returns result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
we do not pre fund our non qualified pension plans or our other postretirement benefit plans 
change in impact on december  impact on assumption accumulated postretirement service and in thousands benefit obligation interest cost increase percent decrease percent contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december is presented in the following table percentage financial position summary change in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio cash and cash equivalents include approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  of cash included in the assets of discontinued operations 
our dividend payout ratio for the year ended december  was approximately percent compared to percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we expect the total of our beginning cash balance  cash provided from operations and credit capacity under our available credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our normal operating commitments  to pay dividends and to fund a portion of our planned capital expenditures 
our initial funding of the million purchase price for the acquisition of the aquila utility assets  and funding of additional related transaction costs is expected to be made through a borrowing on our billion acquisition facility 
permanent financing to replace the funding from the acquisition facility and financing to provide for a portion of the costs of additional planned capital expenditures is expected to be provided through a combination of new equity  mandatory convertible securities  unsecured debt at the holding company level and internally generated cash resources 
in  we initiated a strategic assessment of several of our non regulated power plants  including the possible sale of certain of those assets 
a decision regarding any potential sale is expected to be made during the second quarter of proceeds from any such sale would reduce our requirements for permanent financing related to the aquila transaction and for financing of additional planned capital expenditures 
cash flow activities in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
cash flows from operations decreased million from the prior year amount  affected by a million increase in income from continuing operations and the following a million increase in cash flows from the change in current operating assets and liabilities 
this is primarily driven by decreases in cash flow resulting from changes in net accounts receivable and accounts payable  which were more than offset by million more in cash flows due to changes in materials  supplies and fuel during the year 
fluctuations in our materials  supplies and fuel balances are largely the result of natural gas inventory held by our energy marketing company in the form of storage agreements 
a million decrease from the net change in derivative assets and liabilities primarily from derivatives associated with normal operations of our gas and oil marketing business and related commodity price fluctuations 
higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million 
a decrease in cash flows resulting from the change in net regulatory assets and liabilities of million primarily related to fuel cost adjustments for cheyenne light 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  including approximately million for construction expenditures for the valencia plant  approximately million for construction expenditures for wygen ii  expenditures associated with oil and gas properties of approximately million  capitalized costs of approximately million related to the aquila acquisition  approximately million for construction expenditures for wygen iii  and property  plant and equipment additions including ongoing maintenance capital in the normal course of business 
we had cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to the following cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock  and cash proceeds of million from the issuance of first mortgage bonds 
partially offsetting the cash inflows from financing activities were the following net payment of million on our credit facility  payment of million of cash dividends on common stock  and payment of million including the call of our outstanding debt with ge capital of million  as well as long term debt maturities 
in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
cash flows from operations increased million from the prior year amount  affected by a million increase in income from continuing operations and by the following a million increase in cash flows from the change in current operating assets and liabilities 
this is primarily driven by changes in net accounts receivable and accounts payable and million more in cash flows due to changes in material  supplies and fuel during the year 
fluctuations in our material  supplies and fuel balances are largely the result of natural gas inventory held by our energy marketing company in the form of storage agreements 
a million increase in deferred income taxes  largely the result of accelerated deductions associated with property  plant and equipment  the tax effect of recognized benefit plan obligations  and higher intangible drilling costs related to increased activity at our oil and gas segment 
higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million 
a million impairment charge in for the las vegas i power plant included as an expense in  but which did not impact cash flows 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  including construction expenditures of approximately million for wygen ii  the acquisition of oil and gas assets in the piceance basin in colorado for million  expenditures for development drilling of oil and gas properties of approximately million  and property  plant and equipment additions in the normal course of business 
partially offsetting the cash outflows from investing activities was the following million of cash received from the sale of our texas based crude oil marketing and transportation assets 
we had cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to the following a million increase in borrowings on our revolving bank facility 
partially offsetting the cash inflows from financing activities were the following the payment of million of cash dividends on common stock  net payment of million related to the black hills colorado project level debt refinancing  and payment of long term debt maturities 
dividends dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in this reflects an increase in comparison to prior years dividend levels of per share in and per share in all dividends were paid out of operating cash flows 
our three year annualized dividend growth rate was percent 
in november and february  our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per share 
if this dividend is maintained throughout  it will be equivalent to per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
liquidity on february   we completed the issuance and sale of approximately million shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a sale price of per share  in a private placement to institutional investors 
net proceeds of approximately million were used for the repayment of debt 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are our revolving credit facility and cash provided by operations 
our liquidity position remained strong during as of december   we had approximately million of cash unrestricted for operations 
approximately million of the cash balance at december  was restricted by subsidiary debt agreements that limit our subsidiaries ability to dividend cash to the parent company 
our million revolving credit facility expires on may  the cost of borrowings or letters of credit issued under the facility is determined based on our credit ratings 
at our current ratings levels  the facility has an annual facility fee of basis points  and has a borrowing spread of basis points over libor which equates to a percent one month borrowing rate as of december  
on march   we entered into a second amendment to our revolving credit facility 
the second amendment i increased the limit for borrowings or other credit accommodations on the separate credit facility for our energy marketing subsidiary from million to million  ii increased the allowed total commitments under the revolving credit facility without requiring amendment of the facility from million to million  iii effective with the acquisition of certain electric and gas utility assets from aquila  will increase the recourse leverage ratio limit from to to to for the first year after completion of the aquila asset acquisition  reverting to to thereafter  and iv allowed for other modifications to enable us to complete the aquila asset acquisition 
our revolving credit facility can be used to fund our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had borrowings of million and million of letters of credit issued 
available capacity remaining on our revolving credit facility was approximately million at december  the credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions and maintenance of the following financial covenants a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and percent of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning january   a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to  or to for the first year after the aquila acquisition  and an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to if these covenants are violated  it would be considered an event of default entitling the lenders to terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
a default under the credit facility may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants or certain other covenants under the credit facility  a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  other debt obligations of million or more 
a default under the credit facility would permit the participating banks to restrict our ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans with interest and require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends unless no default  or no event of default  exists prior to  or would result after giving effect to such action 
our consolidated net worth was million at december   which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we were required to maintain under the credit facility 
our long term debt ratio at december  was percent  our total debt leverage long term debt and short term debt was percent  our recourse leverage ratio was approximately percent and our interest expense coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was to in addition  enserco  our energy marketing segment  has a million uncommitted  discretionary line of credit to provide support for the purchase and sale of natural gas and crude oil 
the line of credit is secured by all of enserco s assets 
this facility expires on may   prior to which we expect to renew the facility or enter into a replacement facility with similar acceptable terms 
at december   there were outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility of million  with no borrowing balances outstanding on the facility 
during june  we entered into a short term  non interest bearing  secured promissory note payable to public service company of new mexico in connection with the purchase of certain equipment and related assets for the company s valencia project in new mexico 
the company recorded the promissory note payable at the stated amount of the debt of million  less interest imputed at a rate of percent totaling million  for a net amount of million 
the secured promissory note was paid in full in december on april   we called our outstanding debt with ge capital in the amount of million 
the associated payment guarantees provided by us were also terminated 
on may   we entered into a senior unsecured billion acquisition facility with abn amro bank nv as administrative agent and various other banks to provide for funding for our pending acquisition of aquila s electric utility in colorado and its gas utilities in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa 
the acquisition facility is a committed facility to fund an acquisition term loan in a single draw in an amount of up to billion 
the commitment to fund the acquisition term loan terminates on august  upon funding of the loan  the loan termination date is february  the acquisition facility includes conditions precedent to funding which include consummation of the aquila acquisition substantially in accordance with the existing asset purchase agreement 
borrowings under the term loan can be made under a base rate option  which is based on the then current prime rate  or under a libor option  which is based on the then current libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor borrowings is basis points during the period from the initial funding under the term loan to six months thereafter  basis points during the period from six months and one day after the initial funding to nine months thereafter  and basis points during the period from nine months and one day after the initial funding until the loan maturity 
the facility also includes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants which largely replicate the covenants under our existing revolving credit facility 
our initial funding of the million purchase price for the acquisition of the aquila utility assets  and funding of additional related transaction costs is expected to be made through a borrowing on our billion acquisition facility 
permanent financing to replace the funding from the acquisition facility and financing to provide for a portion of the costs of additional planned capital expenditures is expected to be provided through a combination of new equity  mandatory convertible securities  unsecured debt at the holding company level  and internally generated cash resources 
in  we initiated a strategic assessment of several of our non regulated power plants  including the possible sale of certain of those assets 
a decision regarding any potential sale is expected to be made during the second quarter of proceeds from any such sale would reduce our requirements for permanent financing related to the aquila transaction and for financing of additional planned capital expenditures 
our wygen i project debt of million matures in june we intend to refinance this indebtedness with long term financing prior to maturity 
on november   cheyenne light completed a million first mortgage bond private placement offering 
the bonds mature in the proceeds of the bond issuance were used to repay intercompany indebtedness incurred to finance a portion of the construction costs of our wygen ii power plant 
the bonds have a percent coupon with interest payable semi annually 
prior to issuing the bonds  we entered into a treasury lock to hedge the interest rate on the bonds 
the treasury lock cash settled on october   the pricing date of the bond offering  and resulted in a million payment to the counterparty 
the payment was recorded as a regulatory asset and will be amortized over the life of the related bonds as additional interest expense 
our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results  and capital market conditions 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all

future projects are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  actual expenditures may vary significantly from forecasted estimates 
market risk disclosures our activities in the regulated and unregulated energy sectors expose us to a number of risks in the normal operation of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing business  our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets  interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our natural gas marketing business transacted in canadian dollars 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
trading activities natural gas and crude oil marketing we have a natural gas and crude oil marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our end use origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators and industrial customers with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing and trading natural gas and crude oil 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial derivative instruments including over the counter swaps and options and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our gas marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the gas marketing crpp as approved by the executive risk committee 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures we use a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas and oil marketing portfolio 
we limit and monitor our market risk through established limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location and duration 
such limits include those on fixed price  basis  index  storage  transportation and foreign exchange positions 
our market risk limits are monitored by our risk management function to ensure compliance with our stated risk limits 
the risk management function operates independently from our energy marketing group 
the limits are measured  monitored and regularly reported to and reviewed by our executive risk committee 
daily risk management activities include reviewing positions in relation to established position limits  assessing changes in daily mark to market and other non statistical risk management techniques 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas and crude oil marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k

except in circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  sfas does not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our natural gas marketing positions are economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
at december   we had a mark to fair value unrealized gain of million for our natural gas and crude oil marketing activities 
of this amount  million was current and million was non current 
the sources of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value and thereafter total fair value actively quoted ie  exchange traded prices prices provided by other external sources modeled total the following table presents a reconciliation of our energy marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our energy marketing forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market 
in accordance with gaap and industry practice  the company includes a liquidity reserve in its gaap marked to market fair value 
this liquidity reserve accounts for the estimated impact of the bid ask spread in a liquidation scenario under which the company is forced to liquidate its forward book on the balance sheet date

our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps and options 
our hedging policy allows up to percent of our natural gas and percent of our crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to two years in the future 
our hedging strategy is conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective  accordingly  we might not externally hedge a portion of our natural gas production when we have offsetting price risk for the fuel requirements of our power generating activities 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated  and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume price mmbtu day cig swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso basis swap nwr basis swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume price bbls month nymex swap calendar nymex put calendar nymex swap calendar nymex swap nymex put calendar nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap the hedge agreements entered into by the company had a fair value of approximately million as of december  power generation we have a portfolio of gas fired generation assets located throughout several western states 
the outputs from most of these generation assets are sold under long term tolling contracts with third parties whereby any commodity price risk is transferred to the third party 
however  we do have a gas fired generation asset under a long term contract that does possess market risk for fuel purchases 
it is our policy that fuel risk  to the extent possible  be hedged 
since we are long natural gas in our exploration and production segment  we look at our enterprise wide natural gas market risk when hedging at the subsidiary level 
therefore  we may attempt to hedge only enterprise wide long or short positions 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows in thousands weighted pre tax average maximum accumulated fixed terms non non other interest in current current current current comprehensive december  notional rate years assets assets liabilities liabilities income loss interest rate swaps december  interest rate swaps based on december  market interest rates and balances  a loss of approximately million would be realized and reported in pre tax earnings during the next twelve months 
estimated and realized losses will likely change during the next twelve months as market interest rates change 
in addition to the interest rate swaps above  during the third quarter of  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million and terms of years or years to hedge the risk of interest rate movement between the hedge dates and the expected pricing date for a portion of the company s anticipated long term debt financings 
the swaps have a mandatory early termination date of june  as of december   the mark to market value was million 
these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  any resulting gain or loss will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet and amortized into earnings as additional interest income or expense over the life of the related long term financing 
on july   cheyenne light entered into a million treasury lock to hedge a million first mortgage bond offering which was completed in november the treasury lock cash settled on october   the pricing date of the offering  and resulted in a million payment to the counterparty 
the payment was recorded as a regulatory asset and will be amortized over the life of the related bonds as additional interest expense 
at december   we had million of outstanding  variable rate  long term debt of which million was not offset with interest rate swap transactions that effectively convert a portion of the debt to a fixed rate 
a basis point increase in interest rates would cause pre tax interest expense to increase million in the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our long term debt obligations  including current maturities in thousands thereafter total long term debt fixed rate a average interest rate variable rate b average interest rate total long term debt average interest rate a excludes unamortized premium or discount 
b approximately percent of the variable rate long term debt has been hedged with interest rate swaps converting the floating rates to fixed rates with an average interest rate of percent 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at the end of the year  our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utility segments was concentrated primarily with investment grade companies 
approximately percent of our credit exposure was with investment grade companies 
the remaining credit exposure is with non investment grade or non rated counterparties  of which a portion was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  or parental guarantees 
foreign exchange contracts our natural gas and crude oil marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million canadian dollars  respectively 
these contracts had a fair value of million at december  and  and have been recorded as derivative assets liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  were settled by february  new accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for information on new accounting standards adopted in or pending adoption
