overview all of the operations of airtran holdings  inc the company  airtran  we or us are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc airtran airways or airways 
airways is one of the largest low cost scheduled airlines in the united states in terms of departures and seats offered 
we operate scheduled airline service primarily in short haul markets principally in the eastern united states  with a majority of our flights originating and terminating at our hub in atlanta  georgia 
as of january   we operated boeing b and boeing b aircraft offering approximately scheduled flights per day to locations in the united states 
we offer very competitive fares by concentrating on keeping our unit costs low 
a key to our success is the enthusiasm and skill of the airtran employees 
during  we continued our track record of operating profitably 
we reported operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
for we reported operating income of million  net income of million  and diluted earnings per common share of 
we were able to substantially improve our annual profitability despite a percent increase in average fuel cost per gallon 
the improvement in profitability was driven primarily by a percent improvement in unit revenues as measured by passenger revenue per available seat mile  a percent decrease in unit operating costs as measured by operating cost per available seat mile  and a percent increase in the size of our operation as measured by available seat miles 
our net income was negatively impacted by a non operating charge of million million net of tax to expense the costs we incurred in connection with our exchange offer for all of the outstanding shares of midwest air group  inc midwest  which we withdrew during the third quarter 
during  we continued our growth by taking delivery of ten b aircraft bringing our total fleet to aircraft at year end 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles  increased percent 
the increase in capacity was attributable to a percent increase in the number of departures and a percent increase in average stage length 
our traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles  increased percent  resulting in a percentage point increase in passenger load factor to percent 
we experienced several challenges in  including record fuel prices and increased competition 
nevertheless  we generated a record profit in the second quarter  took delivery of ten new aircraft  and commenced new service to charleston  south carolina  daytona beach  florida  newburgh  new york  phoenix  arizona  portland  maine  san diego  california and st 
louis  missouri 

table of contents 
index to financial statements during we carried in excess of million revenue passengers  continued to reduce non fuel unit operating cost  as we reduced non fuel operating cost per available seat mile for the sixth consecutive year  took delivery of ten new b aircraft  secured financing for nine of our ten aircraft deliveries scheduled for arranged new financing for aircraft pre delivery deposits for aircraft deliveries  initiated new service to charleston  south carolina  daytona beach  florida  newburgh  new york  phoenix  arizona  portland  maine  san diego  california and st 
louis  missouri  launched new non stop routes created over new jobs throughout our network  and announced that we will begin service to san juan  puerto rico in our plans for focus on continuing the growth of our operations 
we intend to do this by adding new b aircraft to our fleet  keeping our unit costs at levels that rank among the best in the industry  looking for new market opportunities that will satisfy the transportation needs of our customers  and providing our customers with a travel experience worth repeating 
we expect our mix of low fares  excellent customer service  an affordable business class product  and one of the youngest all boeing aircraft fleets will provide product value that customers will continue to find attractive 
we will face challenges during managing costs and increasing revenues in the face of high fuel costs will continue to be a primary focus 
jet fuel market prices have recently increased dramatically 
for example  the average december market price before taxes and fees of gulf coast jet fuel increased to per gallon compared to an average price per gallon of 
if our fuel prices remain at historic high levels or increase further  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate incremental revenues sufficient to offset fuel costs 
additionally  our revenues may be adversely impacted by emerging weak macroeconomic conditions in the united states 
the pilots collective bargaining agreement became amendable in and is currently in mediation  the impact on our operating results of any new collective bargaining agreement is uncertain 
based on our current outlook  we expect capacity as measured by available seat miles to increase by approximately percent to percent for compared to additionally  we expect our non fuel unit operating costs per available seat mile to be flat to down percent compared to our estimated all in fuel costs in the first quarter will be between and per gallon  including the benefit of our fuel risk management program 
this assumes barrel crude oil and a refining margin 
we project the all in fuel costs  including the benefit of our fuel risk management program  to be between and per gallon 
total fuel consumption is projected to be between million to million gallons 
air travel tends to be seasonal 
the second quarter tends to be our strongest revenue quarter

income tax expense our effective income tax rate was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our tax expense for includes a one time benefit of million resulting from an adjustment to our deferred tax liabilities due to a decrease in our state effective rate 
the overall rate increase resulted primarily from a combination of the million benefit and permanent differences related to stock based compensation 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which is an increase of million compared to december  as of december  we also had million of restricted cash and million of long term investments 
our primary sources of cash are from operating activities and primary uses of cash are for investing and financing activities 
operating activities in provided million of cash flow compared to million in cash flow from operating activities is related to both the level of our profitability and to changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 
operating cash inflows are largely attributable to revenues derived from the transportation of passengers 
operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for fuel  labor  aircraft rent  aircraft maintenance  marketing and other activities

index to financial statements changes in the components of our working capital also impact cash flow from operating activities 
changes in the air traffic liability balance and the related accounts receivable balance have had a significant impact on our net cash flow from operating activities 
we have a liability to provide future air travel because travelers tend to purchase air transportation in advance of their intended travel date 
advanced ticket sales  which are recorded in air traffic liability  fluctuate seasonally and also provide cash as airtran grows and consequently receives additional cash for future travel

during purchases of available for sale securities exceeded sales of available for sale securities by million 
investing activities also include expenditures for aircraft deposits  the purchase of aircraft and other property and equipment  and deferred costs related to the proposed acquisition of midwest 
aircraft purchase contracts typically require that the purchaser make pre delivery deposits to the manufacturer 
these deposits are refunded at the time of aircraft delivery

in june  we entered into an amendment to an agreement with an aircraft manufacturer to purchase an additional b aircraft 
the newly ordered aircraft are scheduled to be delivered during and also  pursuant to that same amendment  we agreed to reschedule the delivery positions for six b aircraft on firm order 
the aircraft originally scheduled to be delivered during the second half of and first half of are now scheduled to be delivered during in october we rescheduled the delivery dates for three b aircraft on firm order from to the new orders and revised delivery dates are reflected in this annual report 
aircraft purchase contracts typically require the purchaser to make pre delivery deposits to the manufacturer 
we have arranged pre delivery deposit financing for a portion of our pre delivery deposit requirements for aircraft scheduled to be delivered in   and some aircraft in the pre delivery deposit financing typically funds between percent and percent of our pre delivery deposit obligation for any given aircraft 
our aircraft purchase commitments for the next five years  in aggregate  are in thousands     and  these amounts include payment commitments  including payment of pre delivery deposits  for aircraft on firm order 
payment commitments include the forecasted impact of contractual price escalations 
the aircraft purchase commitment totals do not reflect the effects of prearranged aircraft financings 
aircraft financing arrangements of the b aircraft we have on order  we have secured debt financing for nine b aircraft scheduled for delivery in such debt financing funds approximately percent of the total cost of the aircraft 
while our intention is to finance the remainder of the aircraft on order through a combination of debt and lease financings  we have not yet arranged for such financing 
letters of credit as of december   million of restricted cash relates to outstanding letters of credit  primarily for airport facilities and insurance 
investments as of december  we had short term and long term investments of million and million  respectively 
in december we were advised that one of the funds that we had invested in would be closed to new investments and immediate redemptions and that there had been a one percent decline in the net asset value of the fund 
the fund currently has a projected redemption schedule that will result in approximately percent of the fund being redeemed in as a result  we have classified the remaining percent of our investment  which is expected to payout in  as long term as of december

index to financial statements year cash requirements and sources of liquidity during  we will need cash for capital expenditures and debt maturities 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures and debt and capital lease maturities will be funded with cash flow from operations  financings  and the use of existing cash resources 
we anticipate that during expenditures for acquisition of other property and equipment and rotable parts will aggregate approximately million  expenditures  not funded by committed financing  for the acquisition of aircraft will aggregate approximately million  and the maturities of existing debt and capital lease obligations will aggregate million 
we anticipate obtaining additional aircraft acquisition related financing which would reduce the expenditures  not funded by financing  for the acquisition of aircraft to approximately million 
we have various options available to meet our debt repayments  capital expenditures and operating commitments including internally generated funds and various financing or leasing options 
additionally  we have an outstanding shelf registration which we may utilize to raise funds for aircraft financings or other purposes in the future 
however  except as discussed in the following paragraph  we have no unused lines of credit available and our owned aircraft and our pre delivery deposits are pledged as collateral for outstanding debt 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available for all b aircraft deliveries or for other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
should fuel prices remain high and if we are unable to generate revenues to cover our costs  we may slow our growth  including through the rescheduling of aircraft deliveries or through the sale  lease or sublease of some of our aircraft 
in january  one of the counter parties to our derivative financial arrangements agreed to provide us with an unsecured line of credit of up to million to fund any of our future collateral obligations arising from certain derivative financial arrangements 
the line of credit commitment expires july income taxes we have not been required to pay significant federal or state income taxes since because we have had a loss for federal income tax purposes in each of those years  largely because tax basis depreciation has exceeded depreciation expense calculated for financial accounting purposes 
our december  consolidated balance sheet includes gross deferred tax assets of million and gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
the deferred tax assets include million pertaining to the tax effect of million of federal net operating losses nols previously recognized as a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
such nols  which expire in the years to  are available to be carried forward to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce future income tax payments 
our deferred income tax liability is in large part due to the excess of the financial statement carrying value of owned flight equipment and other assets over the tax bases of such assets 
consequently  future tax basis depreciation will tend to be lower than financial accounting depreciation for these assets 
accordingly  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income 
section of the internal revenue code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the event of an ownership change as defined in the code  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused nols in excess of the annual limitation may be carried over to later years 
as of december   we were not subject to the limitations under section contractual obligations our contractual obligations of december  are estimated to be due as follows in millions nature of commitment total thereafter long term debt operating lease obligations capital lease obligations aircraft purchase commitments other total contractual obligations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements includes principal and interest payments  forecasted at the current interest rates  on the aforementioned debt of approximately billion 
our debt agreements for aircraft acquisitions generally carry terms of twelve years and are repaid either quarterly or semiannually 
amounts include minimum operating leases obligations for aircraft  airport facilities and other leased property 
amounts exclude contingent payments and aircraft maintenance deposit payments based on flight hours or landings 
lease agreements are generally for fifteen years on aircraft obligations 
amounts include payment commitments  including payment of pre delivery deposits  for aircraft on firm order 
payment commitments include the forecasted impact of contractual price escalations 
as noted under aircraft acquisitions and aircraft purchase commitments  we have arranged pre delivery deposit financing for a portion of our pre delivery deposit requirements for aircraft scheduled to be delivered in   and some in the above table does not reflect the effects of such financings 
amounts include other contractual commitments 
the table does not include payments to be made to third party aircraft maintenance contractors pursuant to agreements whereby we pay such contractors based on aircraft flight hours or landings 
the table does not include liabilities to vendors  employees and others classified as current liabilities on our december  consolidated balance sheet 
a variety of assumptions are necessary in order to derive the information with respect to contractual commitments described in the above table  including  but not limited to  the timing of the aircraft delivery dates 
our actual obligations may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a material current or future affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  liquidity or resulted operations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have variable interests in many of our aircraft leases 
the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase  finance and lease aircraft to us 
these leasing entities meet the criteria of variable interest entities  as defined by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
we are generally not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee  a fixed price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft 
this is the case in the majority of our aircraft leases  however  we have two aircraft leases that contain fixed price purchase options that allow us to purchase the aircraft at predetermined prices on specified dates during the lease term 
we have not consolidated the related trusts because even taking into consideration these purchase options  we are not the primary beneficiary based on our cash flow analysis 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial accounting policies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue recognition 
passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided 
ticket sales for transportation which has not yet been provided are recorded as air traffic liability 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates 
the balance of the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
passenger revenue accounting is inherently complex and the measurement of the air traffic liability is subject to some uncertainty 
a nonrefundable ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel unless the customer exchanges the ticket in advance of such date for a credit to be used by the customer as a form of payment for another ticket 
we recognize as revenue the value of a non refundable ticket at the date of scheduled travel unless the customer exchanges his or her ticket for credit 
a percent of credits expire unused 
we recognize as revenue over time  in proportion to the credits that are used  the value of credits that we expect to go unused based on historical experience 
estimating the amount of credits that will go unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
changes in our estimate of the amount of unused credits could have an effect on our revenues 
frequent flyer program 
we accrue a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for awards earned under our a rewards program based on awards we expect to be redeemed on us or the contractual rate of expected redemption on other carriers 
incremental cost includes the cost of fuel  catering  and miscellaneous direct costs  but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership  maintenance  labor or overhead allocation 
we adjust this liability based on points earned and redeemed  changes in the estimated incremental costs  and changes in the a rewards program 
we also sell points in our a rewards program to third parties  such as credit card companies  internet service providers and car rental agencies 
revenue from the sale of points is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is expected to be provided  based on estimates of its fair value 
the remaining portion  which is the excess of the total sales proceeds over the estimated fair value of the transportation to be provided  is recognized in other revenue at the time of sale 
a change to the time period over which the points are used currently one to two years  the actual redemption activity or our estimate of the amount or fair value of expected transportation could have a significant impact on our revenue in the year of change as well as future years 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
we enter into various derivative financial instruments with financial institutions to reduce the impact of fluctuations in jet fuel prices on future fuel expense 
our primary objective of entering into commodity derivative instruments is to reduce the impact on our operating results of the volatility of jet fuel prices 
we enter into both fuel swap and option arrangements 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense and cash flows 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the derivative instruments that we have executed 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires companies to recognize all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  unrealized gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges for accounting purposes  a company must designate the hedging instrument  based upon the exposure being hedged  as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings for example  in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes or do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes  changes in the unrealized fair value of the derivatives are reflected in other income expense each period

index to financial statements sfas is a very complex accounting standard with stringent requirements which generally requires documenting the hedging strategy  using statistical analysis to qualify certain derivative arrangement as a hedge for accounting purposes both on a historical and a prospective basis  and preparing strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is designated by the company 
as required by sfas  airtran assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis 
this analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses intended to assess the effectiveness each derivative designated as a hedge for accounting purposes 
certain derivatives may not qualify for treatment as accounting hedges if there is an insufficient correlation between the hedged item and the derivative underlying price 
for example  derivatives based on crude oil as the underlying price did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as of december  the company can not predict whether crude oil based derivatives will qualify for hedge accounting treatment in the future 
airtran enters into commodity related derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s commodity related derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or mathematical option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in the respective markets 
also  since there is not a well defined forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes in jet fuel prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated using other energy commodity futures prices such heating oil and adjusted based on historical variations to those similar energy commodities 
in summary  sfas requires that changes in fair value ie unrealized gains and losses on some derivative financial instruments be recognized in earnings in advance of realization 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments may result in increased and unanticipated earnings volatility 
additionally  sfas does not require that companies account for similar transactions in a similar manner  consequently  one airline may account for the changes in the fair value of a heating oil option as a component of other comprehensive income whereas another airline may reflect the changes in the fair value of a heating oil option in earnings 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by such assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of time the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
in accounting for long lived assets we must estimate the useful lives and salvage values of the assets 
the actual useful lives and salvage values could be different from the estimates 
generally changes in estimated lives and salvage values are accounted for by adjusting depreciation and amortization expense prospectively 
accounting for convertible debt instruments 
in august  the fasb issued for comment an exposure draft of a proposed fasb staff position apb a that would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments  including our percent convertible notes due under the proposed new rules for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost 
the effect of the proposed new rules for the convertible notes is that the equity component would be included in the paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes 
higher interest expense would result by recognizing the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of convertible notes using an effective interest rate method of amortization 
the fasb may issue final guidance in the effective date of the final pronouncement is uncertain

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates and commodity prices ie  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial accounting policies and additional information 
interest rates we had approximately million and million of variable rate debt as of december  and december   respectively 
we have mitigated our exposure on certain variable rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps expire between and the notional amount of the outstanding debt related to interest rate swaps at december  was million 
the interest rate swaps effectively result in us paying a fixed rate of interest on a portion of our floating rate debt securities through the expiration of the swaps 
as of december   the fair market value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of million 
if average interest rates increased by basis points during as compared to  our projected interest expense would increase by approximately million 
as of december  and  the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be billion and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk on our fixed rate debt  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december   and approximately million as of december  aviation fuel our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel expense for the years ended and represented approximately percent and percent of our operating expenses  respectively 
efforts to reduce our exposure to increases in the price and decreases in the availability of aviation fuel include the utilization of fuel pricing arrangements in purchase contracts with fuel suppliers covering a portion of our anticipated fuel requirements 
the fuel pricing arrangements consist of both fixed price and collar arrangements 
because these contracts are accounted for under the normal purchase exception included in sfas  these contracts are not considered derivative financial instruments for financial reporting purposes 
as of december   we had no fixed pricing arrangements with fuel suppliers for any future period 
in addition to the fuel purchase contracts discussed above  we have entered into fuel related derivative financial instruments with financial institutions to reduce the impact of fluctuations in jet fuel prices on future fuel expense 
our primary objective of entering into derivative instruments is to reduce the impact on our operating results of the volatility of jet fuel prices 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   the fair market value of our fuel related derivative assets was million and was comprised of option and swap arrangements 
as of december   these contracts pertain to million gallons of our fuel purchases and million gallons of our fuel purchases and represent percent of our anticipated jet fuel requirement and percent of our jet fuel requirements 
as of january   we entered into additional fuel related derivatives  which increase the gallons under contract to million gallons and million gallons for and  respectively 
this represents percent and percent of our total and anticipated fuel consumption  respectively 
for every dollar increase per barrel in crude oil or refining costs  our fuel expense for  before the impact of our derivative financial instruments  would increase million based on current and projected operations
