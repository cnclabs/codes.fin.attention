subsequent to its press release and related filing of its current report on form k with the securities and exchange commission regarding its earnings  the company determined that certain adjustments were required to be made to the financial information contained in the press release and form k 
the adjustments were not material to the results of operations or financial condition of the company  and the adjusted financial information has been included in this annual report on form k 
our fiscal year ends on december references below to annual periods or years refer to the fiscal years ended december results overview total revenue for was million  a decrease from total revenue 
the decline was comprised of a decrease in system sales revenue  partially offset by an increase in support services revenue 
the decline in system sales revenue was the result of a substantial decline in sales orders for 
table of contents our large hospital and hospital network radiology products  the market for which has entered a mature phase and which now consists largely of replacement sales 
our gross margin percentage was relatively stable in compared to at  consisting of a gross margin on system sales and a gross margin on support services revenue  both generally in line with levels 
our total research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for were million  down million from the level 
our net loss was million in  which included million in costs of employee severance and related expenses  compared to a net loss of million in  which included million in costs of integration into our operations of camtronics  a company we acquired in late our bookings of new orders for system sales and support services for were million  down by million from the level 
at december  we had million in contracted orders backlog  of which million were support services orders  compared to million at december   of which million were support services orders 
we expect to recognize revenue from our backlog of million in  million in  and the remainder by our orders backlog increases as we enter into new contracts  and decreases as we earn and recognize revenue from those orders 
significant events in during the year ended december  we continued to focus on our core set of long term strategic goals 
we believe the following events were significant with respect to accomplishment of those goals in the third quarter of we introduced radsuite express  our standardized offering of content management  advanced visualization and workflow tools originally aimed at the less penetrated market of hospitals with fewer than beds 
as the architecture and configuration have matured  we have come to believe that radsuite express is an appropriate solution for a larger portion of the market than originally anticipated 
we added new customers and deepened relationships with existing customers 
at december  we had contractual relationships with hospitals  up from at the end of of these hospitals  had installed one or more of our products  up from at the end of we converted cardiology customers to five year maintenance and support agreements in place of the historical one year renewal agreements 
we began a systematic process to thoroughly evaluate every area of our business and  as a part of that process  we implemented a plan to reorganize our management team 
notably  in chris e 
perkins succeeded grady o 
floyd as our chief operating officer  and on march  john w 
wilhoite will succeed w 
randall pittman as our chief financial officer and treasurer 
as a result  in there will be new leadership at the executive levels in our operations  finance  sales  and marketing areas with a commitment to rationalize our cost structure  focus on product development and product management  and improve our profitability 
in may  we acted to align our operating expenses with the current level of our revenue by reducing our workforce through elimination of existing positions and normal attrition  eliminating thirty positions in the customer service and research and development areas 
sources of revenue a typical sale of our solution is comprised of system sales and support services 
revenue from system sales is derived from the licensing of our advanced visualization  clinical content management  and clinical workflow for radsuite and heartsuite collectively referred to as our enterprise visual medical system  or evms  as well as from sales and integration of third party components that are required to implement our solution 
support services revenue is derived from fees related to the implementation  training  and on going customer support of our solution 
our software is comprised of four main components radsuite advanced visualization  our suite of software tools for the advanced visualization and analysis of digital medical images  clinical content 
table of contents management  our image archival and distribution management software  clinical workflow  our standards based software used to manage integration and data migration between our solution and other health information systems throughout the enterprise  and heartsuite  our suite of software tools focused on the cardiology department 
although clinical content management and heartsuite software products are available collectively as stand alone applications  we offer our software primarily as an integrated enterprise level image management solution 
license pricing for radsuite advanced visualization is primarily determined by either the number of licenses based on the number of concurrent users or on the average annual study volume 
license pricing for clinical content management and clinical workflow is determined based on projected volume and size of image studies to be stored or migrated by the particular customer 
license pricing for heartsuite software products is determined based on the number of workstations purchased 
we offer customers our software as perpetual or term licenses  in either case with maintenance and support relating to the software 
term licenses for our software are typically from two to ten years with annual renewals after the initial term 
the sale and integration of third party components typically include servers  data storage  backup and recovery systems  workstations and monitors  database software and computed radiography devices as well as orthopedic templates and dictation systems 
we also derive revenue from the provision of support services  including implementation  project planning  management  design and training services 
our customers typically contract for these support services pursuant to their initial agreements with us 
the initial term of these support services under these agreements range from one to ten years  with a typical duration of five years 
upon expiration of the initial term  these agreements typically renew automatically from year to year thereafter until terminated 
ascension health  the largest not for profit hospital system in the united states  is our largest customer 
revenue associated with facilities controlled by ascension health accounted for approximately of our total revenue in  and accounted for of our total contracted backlog at december  we anticipate that ascension health will continue to be a significant customer as we continue to support our existing installations as well as sign add on orders and new order addenda with additional ascension health facilities 
cost of revenue the cost of system sales consists of the cost of third party components and the cost of software licenses 
the cost of our third party components consists primarily of direct and indirect expenses related to the purchase  manufacturing  shipment  installation and configuration of our solutions 
the cost of our software licenses consists primarily of the amortization of acquired software and the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed software 
the cost of our support services consists primarily of labor costs and overhead relating to the implementation  installation  training  application support and maintenance of our solution as well as costs related to maintenance of third party components 
the cost of support services revenue varies based upon the productivity of our support services organization as well as costs associated with the use of outside contractors to support internal resources 
gross profit our overall gross profit percentage has improved during the last three fiscal years due to an increase in the software content of our system sales and in recurring support services revenue derived from our growing installed base of customers 
gross profit from system sales varies based on several factors  including actual sales prices negotiated in the contracting process  costs associated with purchasing and manufacturing third party components  fluctuations in prices received from third party component manufacturers and distributors relative to the mark up percentages provided for in customer contracts  and the relative mix of the hardware and software components comprising system sales in a given period 

table of contents gross profit from support services varies based on several factors  including actual services fees negotiated during the contracting process  productivity of our professional service team  costs of service agreements related to third party components included in our solution  and costs associated with the use of outside contractors 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  allocated overhead  and the costs of outside contractors 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving the functionality  performance  and integration of our software products 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we strive to introduce additional products and services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including travel  marketing programs  allocated overhead  and sales commissions 
sales and marketing expenses may increase as we expand our selling and marketing activities associated with existing and new product and service offerings to existing and new customers  and build brand awareness 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses  and allocated overhead 
general and administrative expenses may increase with added personnel and as we incur additional professional fees and administrative costs related to the growth of our business and operations  including additional compliance costs in connection with public company corporate governance and financial reporting requirements 
initial public offering and camtronics integration on february   we completed our initial public offering of common stock 
we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on february   our underwriters exercised the over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares at a price of per share 
total proceeds from the initial public offering  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses  were million 
at december   we had  shares of common stock issued   shares of common stock outstanding  and  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding at an exercise price of per share 
on november   we acquired all the stock of camtronics medical systems  ltd  based in hartland  wisconsin  for million in cash 
as of december   we had completed the integration of camtronics into the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of aicpa statement of position  sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  in the application of this standard  we exercise judgment and use estimates to 
table of contents determine the amount of system sales and support services revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
we sell software under three types of licenses perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a customer based on a fixed number of users and or estimates of annual study volumes with no right to return the licensed software 
enterprise licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a customer typically a multi facility health care provider  as opposed to licensing based on a fixed number of users or on estimates of annual study volumes  with no right to return the licensed software 
term licenses software licensed on a term basis according to a fixed number of users and or estimates of annual study volumes 
generally  our software license arrangements do not include significant modification or customization of the underlying software and  as a result  we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we assess each of the four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement  prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred it is our customary practice to obtain acceptance for our software  which is evidenced by written customer acknowledgement 
in the event that we grant a customer the right to specified upgrades  we defer recognition of the entire arrangement fee until we deliver the specified upgrades as we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for specified upgrades 
specified upgrades include  but are not limited to  future software deliverables that are stated in the customer contract 
the customer s payment is deemed fixed or determinable we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties at the time of sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable likelihood of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement or at the time of add on sales to existing customers that collection is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis if all other criteria are met 
we account for software license and non recurring support services revenue included in multiple element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements ie  software maintenance and ongoing support services based on vsoe of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie  software license and non recurring support services 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those services occurs or fair value can be established 
we determine vsoe of fair value for ongoing support services revenue based upon the renewal rates for the maintenance and ongoing support  which coincide with our pricing model 
significant incremental discounts offered in multiple element arrangements that would be characterized as separate elements are infrequent and are applied to the initial arrangement 
for term license arrangements  we recognize revenue for the multiple element arrangement over the term of the arrangement beginning in the month after we receive customer acceptance  provided that the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
software maintenance services generally include rights to upgrades when and if available  telephone support  updates and bug fixes 
software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the 
table of contents maintenance contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
we include the first year of software maintenance in the software license fee 
we defer this software maintenance fee based on its fair value and recognize it ratably over the first year of the arrangement 
ongoing support services generally include telephone support related to third party components 
ongoing support service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the ongoing support services contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
as it relates to services  we may also provide services that vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the customer 
examples of such services include additional database consulting  system configuration  existing systems interface  and network consulting 
these services generally are not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software 
if we have vsoe of fair value for the services  the timing of the software license revenue is not impacted  and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we commonly perform services for which we do not have vsoe of fair value and  accordingly  the software license revenue is deferred until the services are completed 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
we classify shipping and handling cost in cost of system sales 
third party component revenue  including hardware sales and hardware maintenance  is recognized in accordance with contractual terms 
when we are responsible for installing third party components  revenue is recognized when the third party components are delivered  installed and accepted by the customer 
when we are not responsible for installing the third party components  revenue is recognized when the third party components are delivered to the customer 
when third party components and related maintenance are not separately priced in our contracts  we recognize revenue related to the arrangement when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the following is a summary of our product warranty and guarantee and our related accounting policies for these agreements our sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
our sales agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death  personal injury or property damage caused by our personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date but typically limit the amount of award covered to a portion of the fees paid by the customer over a portion of the contract term 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification provisions 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  we warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer as long as the contract remains in effect 
additionally  we warrant that our services will be performed by qualified personnel in a manner consistent with normally accepted industry standards 
we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
as of december  we have a liability of million in our balance sheet for these obligations 
billings may not coincide with the recognition of revenue 
unbilled revenue  which is included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet  occurs when revenue recognition precedes billing to the customer  and arises primarily from sales with predetermined billing schedules 
billings in excess of sales 
table of contents deferred revenue occur when billing to the customer precedes revenue recognition  and arise primarily from sales with partial prepayments upon contract execution and from maintenance revenue billed in advance of performance of the maintenance activity 
we recognize deferred revenue  as applicable  upon delivery and acceptance of products  as ongoing services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
costs related to deferred revenue are included as an asset in our consolidated balance sheet and charged to expense when the related deferred revenue is recognized 
the timing of customer acceptances could significantly affect our results of operations during a given period 
as noted above  we require written acknowledgement from the customer to evidence that delivery of the products or services has occurred 
delays in the implementation process could negatively affect operations in a given period by increasing volatility in revenue recognition 
research and development costs 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of software that will be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized as incurred after technological feasibility has been established and capitalization ceases when the software is generally available for release 
judgment is involved in determining when technological feasibility is reached 
we believe that technological feasibility is reached when we have completed a working model 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in technologies 
costs deemed not recoverable are charged to expense 
costs that are capitalized primarily consist of the direct labor and related benefits of employees and the costs of third party consultants  if applicable 
amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general release 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis using the straight line method over periods not exceeding three years or  if a shorter period  in proportion to expected revenue from the product 
intangible and other long lived assets 
us generally accepted accounting principles require the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations after june   and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
accordingly  we identify and allocate values to intangible assets based on discounted cash flow analyses and market research  as well as our judgment 
intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we evaluate intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and also if and when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenue  which is inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
property  equipment and intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives of the intangible assets are based on management s estimates of the periods over which such assets will generate revenue 
we test the amount recorded as goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment annually  in our case as of october of each year  or more often if circumstances exist that may in our judgment indicate impairment 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of our company  which we define as the amount at which our company could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  to the carrying amount net book value of our company in our financial statements  including amounts recorded as goodwill 
at october   our common stock closed at a price of per share on the nasdaq global market  a per share price well in excess of our net book value per share at that date 
at december   the end of our fiscal year  our common stock closed at a price of per share on the nasdaq global market  again a per share price in excess of our net book value per share 
in the periods since december   our common stock has at times closed on the nasdaq global market at a per share price less than our book value per share  an event which  in the absence of other indicators  would be considered an indicator of possible impairment of our recorded amount of goodwill in our balance sheet 
however  during this same period the company determined based on objective evidence that the fair value of the company is such that impairment of its goodwill is not indicated 
we are continuing to monitor this 
table of contents situation 
however  should circumstances change  it is possible that we would conclude that impairment has occurred  resulting in a revaluation of our recorded amount for goodwill and our other assets and liabilities  and an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations revenue individual radiology system sales typically are larger in terms of both sales dollars and implementation time than individual cardiology system sales 
in any given period  the mix of total system sales revenue to total support services revenue  the mix of hardware to software comprising system sales revenue  and the mix of radiology revenue to cardiology revenue can produce significant variability in the levels of revenue and gross margin reported 
the following table sets forth revenue component data 
year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages system sales support services total revenue total revenue for was million  a decrease from revenue of million 
revenue growth in was the result of both the organic growth of our products and our acquisition of camtronics and its cardiology line of products in late as further explained below  total revenue declined significantly in as a result primarily of slow market demand in the market segments of the medical imaging industry in which we compete 
system sales revenue declined by million  or  in compared to sales of cardiology products were slightly higher in compared to  while sales of our radiology products declined significantly 
the decline is the direct result of a decline in system sales orders in of million  or  compared to our historical primary market for pacs radiology systems for large hospitals and large hospital networks entered a mature phase in demand in that market now consists largely of replacement of existing legacy radiology systems  which lengthens the sales cycle and makes the timing of large orders more difficult to anticipate 
we expect these conditions in the large system radiology market to continue at least throughout  but expect more positive market conditions in our cardiology and small hospital markets 
system sales revenue for was million  a increase over systems sales revenue of million 
the acquisition of camtronics on november  was a contributing factor in our system sales revenue growth  but our system sales excluding cardiology products grew as well  by approximately in this growth was the result of greater numbers of systems installations for both existing and new customers  and of greater acceptance of our products in the marketplace in that period  particularly with multi facility health care providers 
growth in our radiology line of products was driven in equal parts by increased sales of software and third party components  with our sales of software licenses particularly strong with existing customers 
support services revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  over the level 
the increase occurred primarily in our cardiology business on an expanded installed base with our customers and cardiology product upgrades distributed in support services revenue consists primarily of professional services and of maintenance revenue from our customers who subscribe to our ongoing maintenance services 
professional services revenue is ancillary to system sales revenue  and thus will grow as the number of new system installations or system additions grows  and maintenance revenue will grow as system installations grow and as the number of our customers who subscribe to our maintenance services increases 
support services revenue in our radiology business grew only marginally in as the result of the decline in our radiology system sales revenue 

table of contents support services revenue grew by to million in from its level of million 
our acquisition of camtronics on november  was a contributing factor in our support services revenue growth in  but our legacy service offerings grew as well  by in to over million 
both the professional services and system maintenance components of support services revenue grew substantially in gross margin the following table sets forth gross margin earned on revenues for the three years in the period ended december  year ended december  revenue system sales support services total cost of revenue system sales support services total gross profit system sales support services total gross margin system sales support services total system sales gross margin was in  an increase of percentage points over the level 
the relative mix of software to hardware comprising our system sales and the relative mix of radiology to cardiology sales in a given period can have a significant impact on the level of gross margin earned on system sales 
we purchase hardware from third parties for purposes of filling the orders of our customers  and therefore earn a relatively low margin on these sales relative to software sales  which generally carry high gross margins 
cardiology products in general earn slightly lower gross margins than radiology products 
in  sales of both software and hardware were less than in  but hardware sales declined by a greater amount than did software sales  which acted to increase our system sales gross margin 
offsetting this increase and as explained in the revenue section above  cardiology sales increased in while radiology sales decreased  increasing the relative contribution of cardiology sales to total sales  which acted to reduce our gross margin percentage 
our radiology software gross margin was slightly down in compared to  generally due to volume and pricing considerations 
we expect system sales gross margins on an annual basis in the mid forty percent range going forward 
however  we also expect a continuation of competitive pressures  which could act to lower our system sales gross margin  and we expect fluctuations in the system sales margins we earn quarter to quarter depending on the sales mix factors described above 

table of contents system sales gross margin was in compared to in  a decline of percentage points 
this decline in system sales margin is related primarily to our acquisition of camtronics on november  and the inclusion of a full twelve months of cardiology product line revenue and costs in our revenue and gross margin in this lower cardiology margin for the year met our initial expectations  though these margins were lower in the first half of due to one time acquisition accounting adjustments to revenue deferred by camtronics prior to the acquisition 
additionally  our gross margin on the third party components of radiology system sales was approximately two percentage points lower in than in due primarily to pricing considerations 
gross margin earned on the software component of radiology system revenue was flat with as a percentage of software revenue  and the relative mix of the hardware and software components of radiology revenue was approximately the same in as in support services gross margin was in  a decrease of percentage points from the level 
both professional services revenue and maintenance revenue can provide significant cost leverage with respect to gross margin earned in periods of increasing support services revenue  or can adversely affect gross margin in periods of slower growth in revenue because of the fixed nature of the costs of support services revenue  generally labor and overhead and third party consultant costs 
in  our support services gross margin was adversely affected by a lower volume of system installations  by increased use of third party consultants in the support area  and by the increased costs of support personnel whose duties in were primarily administrative in nature and whose costs were charged to general and administrative expense in that period 
somewhat offsetting these increased costs were savings derived from our reduction in workforce in may support services gross margin was in  an increase of percentage points over the margin of 
in  we benefited substantially from the cost leverage described above  as the investments made in prior years in support services headcount and technology were spread over an increasing base of revenue providing customers in both the professional services and maintenance areas  and as that labor force increased its efficiencies in service activities 
correspondingly  support services revenue in earned a much lower gross margin as our increased investments in employees and technology had just been made and we had a smaller installed base of customers 
in addition  we benefited from inclusion of a full twelve months of cardiology support services revenue in  as cardiology support services typically earn a slightly higher gross margin than radiology support services 
the timing of completion of individual system sales installations can significantly impact the level of support services revenue and gross margin from period to period 
with our current mix of business  we expect support services gross margin on an annual basis slightly in excess of our system sales gross margin  assuming continuing efficiencies from our support staff and assuming the cardiology business continues to deliver support services gross margin at the present level  but we also expect some level of timing based variability in the level of support services gross margin reported from period to period 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses total research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the corresponding prior year period  a decrease of million  or  the result primarily of reduced general and administrative expenses due to a change in the year to year duties of some of our personnel  offset by increased research and development expenses caused by higher utilization and higher costs of outsourced development activities 
the decline of in these expenses in compares to a total revenue decline over the same period of 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses in total increased to in compared to in as the result of a decline in revenue without a corresponding decline in these expenses 

table of contents we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we continue to seek product improvements  while general and administrative expenses should remain relatively stable 
sales and marketing expenses may increase as the result of our efforts to seek new markets and customers and further penetrate our existing markets and customer base 
research and development r d year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages r d expense of revenue the increase in research and development expenses in of million  or  is the result of a higher level of utilization and higher costs of outsourced research and development and related services 
we engaged additional third party consultants in in an effort to improve our software product offerings and their delivery to customers  and expect that effort to continue through in addition  in we utilized a portion of our cardiology research and development personnel to fulfill customer obligations existing at the date of our acquisition of camtronics  and accordingly charged costs related to that effort to costs of revenue rather than research and development 
those personnel returned to research and development activities in partially offsetting the effects of these increases in research and development was a reduction in our research and development salaries and benefits expense resulting from our reduction in engineering workforce in may the increase in research and development expense in compared to of million  or  is almost entirely the result of the acquisition of camtronics on november  and the inclusion of the former camtronics research and development expenses in our financial statements for a full twelve month period in increased research and development expense resulting from the camtronics acquisition aside  the level of increase in research and development expense in was minimized by a decline in direct headcount and related expenses and in the number of operations personnel performing research and development activities as the result of the consolidation of engineering staffs between the companies and the efficiencies that resulted from that consolidation 
partially offsetting the effects of the decline in headcount were increased research and development overhead expenses  primarily depreciation  related to the upgrade of laboratory facilities during and and the physical consolidation of facilities into a single location in  and increased stock based compensation expense recognized in as the result of initial adoption of sfas no

sales and marketing s m year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages s m expense of revenue sales and marketing expense  which consists primarily of salaries and related benefits  sales commissions  travel  and expenses related to exhibits and trade shows  was relatively flat in compared to salaries and related benefits were down for the year on slightly reduced headcount  and sales commissions were slightly up for the year 
sales commissions are earned based on achievement of various milestones in completion of individual sales  including customer payment  and are recorded as expense over the period earned 
sales orders in were concentrated in fewer individual sales personnel than in  resulting in a higher rate of commission for those personnel  and we sold a significant number of five year service contract renewals in our cardiology business in place of the historical one year service contracts 
these factors acted to slightly increase commissions expense in despite a lower level of sales orders compared to combined travel  exhibits and trade shows expenses were marginally higher than in 
table of contents the increase in sales and marketing expense in compared to of million  or  is largely the result of the acquisition of camtronics on november  and the reflection in the financial statements of a full twelve months of the former camtronics sales and marketing expenses  and related cross training of the sales staffs and cross selling activities between the radiology and cardiology product lines 
increased sales and marketing expenses in were  however  also the result of our efforts to extend our product base to existing and prospective customers and to increase awareness of our products in the marketplace 
accordingly  expenses were approximately million higher in than in in the combined areas of advertising  targeted marketing and market research  customer relations  and trade show attendance and related expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense under sfas r added approximately million to sales and marketing expense 
partially offsetting these increases were declines in personnel and related expenses reflecting a slight decline in sales and marketing headcount in  and in commissions expense  which declined despite increased revenue as the result of a higher percentage of sales to existing customers  which result in lower commission percentage than sales to new customers  and the effects of timing of the earning of commissions and of differences in the types of sales closed and installed in compared to general and administrative g a year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages g a expense of revenue general and administrative expense declined by million  or in compared to in  a portion of our support services personnel were temporarily engaged in duties of an administrative nature  and accordingly their costs were charged to general and administrative expense 
these personnel no longer perform administrative duties and therefore their costs are no longer included in general and administrative expense 
this change in function  along with reduced executive bonuses in based on the financial performance of the company  are the primary cause of reduced general and administrative expense  partially offset by increased audit and legal expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance and by an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
the increase in general and administrative expense of million  or  in compared to is the result of the acquisition of camtronics on november  and resulting inclusion of a full twelve months of camtronics general and administrative expense in our financial statements  of our compliance with sarbanes oxley  of stock based compensation expense  and of our growth in revenue over that period 
our general and administrative staff was augmented in  adding personnel and personnel related expense of approximately million in support of our increased base of employees and public company obligations 
in addition and for the same reasons  our insurance  property taxes and similar expenses grew significantly in the most significant increases in expense in compared to were our professional and consulting fees and related expenses incurred in connection with sarbanes oxley compliance approximately million  and our recognition of stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r of approximately million in excess of the level 
we expect a future rate of growth in general and administrative expenses of less than that of our other operating expenses and revenue largely due to economies of scale available in most administrative areas 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets related to camtronics acquisition amortization expense related to the acquisition of camtronics consists of straight line amortization of the intangible assets acquired with camtronics over periods of one to six years 
the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets are determined based on projected future economic benefits and expected life cycles of the intangible assets 
integration costs related to camtronics acquisition we incurred integration costs of million in integration costs were comprised primarily of employee costs including travel and relocation expenses  severance and related expenses of terminated employees  and the costs of facility closure 
we believe that camtronics was fully integrated into our business as of december  employee severance and related expenses in second quarter we acted to align our operating expenses with the current level of revenue by reducing our workforce through elimination of certain positions and normal attrition  eliminating thirty positions  primarily in the customer service and engineering areas 
in addition  in the second and third quarters of we terminated the employment of three senior level engineering and sales and marketing executives  and in the fourth quarter of we accepted the resignation of the chief operating officer of the company  and incurred expenses for amounts due these executives under their employment agreements with us including  where applicable  the expense of immediate vesting of unvested stock options and restricted stock awards 
the total expense of million related to our reduction in workforce and termination of executives is included in employee severance and related expenses in the statement of operations 
operating loss for the year ended december   operating loss increased by million as compared to the year ended december  operations were negatively impacted by our decline in revenue and by employee severance and related costs in and by camtronics integration costs in and excluding employee severance and related costs and camtronics integration costs  our operating loss improved to million in from million in  and worsened to million in  the result primarily of our decline in revenue 
other income and expense for the year ended december   interest income increased by million on increased short term investment rates  and interest expense declined by million on payment of scheduled maturities of debt and capital leases without further borrowing 
for the year ended december   interest income and interest expense declined from the prior year by million and million  respectively  as a result of the decline in short term investment balances from their peak at completion of the initial public offering in february and the payment of scheduled maturities of debt and capital lease obligations during

revenue 
in the past  we have at times experienced lower bookings volume in the third quarter of each year relative to other quarters 
we believe that this is the result of the historical capital expenditure patterns of our customer base 
this  in turn  may cause our revenue in the first quarter of the following year to be lower in comparison to the immediately preceding quarter due to the length of our installations and our revenue recognition policies 
gross margin 
our gross margin fluctuates from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in the relative contributions to our total revenue from system sales and support services  the mix of the hardware and 
table of contents software components of systems sales revenue  the mix of cardiology revenue to radiology revenue  and changes in the productivity of support services personnel 
operating expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate due to the timing of sales and of individual marketing programs 
also  the most significant trade show that we attend occurs within the fourth quarter of each year  increasing our sales and marketing expenses in that quarter 
some important additional factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include the length of the sales cycle or implementation time for our solutions  changes in our pricing policies  new product introductions and product enhancements by us or our competitors  technical difficulties or downtime in our solutions  and regulatory compliance costs 
significant changes in the historical patterns of these factors or the occurrence of unforeseen events could cause our operating results to vary widely from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  our liquidity and net cash position was as follows in thousands  except ratios december working capital current ratio cash and cash equivalents short term borrowings and long term debt working capital is total current assets less total current liabilities 
current ratio is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
the decline in cash and cash equivalents in was the result primarily of our net loss for the year 
the decrease in short term borrowings and long term debt from december  to december  is a result of scheduled debt retirement 
operating activities during the year ended december   net cash used in operations was million  representing a decline in cash from operations of million from the level of net cash provided by operations in our net loss for the year of million and adverse changes in some of our working capital accounts  primarily deferred revenue  which declined by million  were primarily responsible for the decline in cash from operating activities 
our working capital is affected by the volume of operations from time to time  which can affect our point in time investments in accounts receivable and inventories  by the timing of payments of our trade liabilities and the receipt of payment from our customers  and by the timing of receipt of acceptances of third party components at our customers sites 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was million  representing an improvement of million over cash used in operations in the improvement was due primarily to improved operations 
in addition  year to year changes in the levels of cash required to maintain accounts receivable and inventories improved our cash position by million  which was offset by a decline in cash required for accounts payable of million 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operations was million  which primarily related to our net loss of million and changes in some of our working capital accounts 
we experienced significant increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory to be sold to customers during the year 
our accounts receivable balance increased as a result of the timing of customer acceptances as well as the timing 
table of contents of new customer contracts 
our inventory increased as a result of the timing of acceptances of third party components at customer sites 
the changes in other working capital accounts were primarily driven by increased volume of operations and the timing of cash payments 
investing activities we used cash of million  million  and million for investing activities during  and  respectively 
we used million  million  and million for property and equipment purchases during  and  respectively 
purchases in were primarily investments in computer equipment and software for internal use and in equipment leased to customers 
capital purchases for and related to investments in equipment for internal use  including test equipment for our research and development and quality assurance departments as well as computer equipment and furniture for new and existing personnel  and to improvements to the building we own in hartland  wisconsin 
future capital expenditures will be made at a level consistent with our growth  development efforts  and staffing levels 
in november  we used million to acquire all the stock of camtronics 
we used million for the purchase of marketable securities and received proceeds of million upon the maturity or sale of some of these securities during those marketable securities consisted of us government agency obligations and corporate commercial paper  all with maturities of less than one year 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in  and million in net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of the proceeds of exercise of employee stock options of million and a decrease in our restricted cash balance  offset by payment of scheduled maturities of debt and capital lease obligations of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of million in proceeds from issuance of common stock on the exercise of employee stock options  offset by the payment of scheduled debt and lease obligations of million 
cash provided by financing activities for resulted primarily from the completion of our initial public offering 
this inflow of cash was partially offset by repayment of our million subordinated debt and other payments on borrowings 
the following table summarizes  as of december   the general timing of future payments including payments of interest under our outstanding capital and operating lease agreements payment due by period in thousands less than more than contractual cash obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations our april loan and security agreement with a bank  as amended in april  and august  provides for borrowing of up to million  subject to certain restrictions 
interest accrues at the bank s prime rate of interest 
this agreement is for a term of two years  at the end of which all amounts borrowed become due and payable 
security for any amounts borrowed under the agreement consists of all assets of the company other than our intellectual property and real estate 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding balances under this line of credit 
we believe our existing cash  together with future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our loan and security agreement  if necessary  will be sufficient to execute our business plan in however  any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to generate revenue growth  the expansion of 
table of contents our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new markets  the timing of introductions of new products and services  enhancements to existing products and services  and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions 
to the extent that our existing cash  together with future cash flows from operations and availability under our loan and security agreement  are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any binding agreement or letter of intent with respect to any other potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the recent decline in price of our common stock may make the raising of additional equity funding on terms that are acceptable to us more difficult 
it is possible that additional funds may not be available to us at all 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into for ordinary business purposes  we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  or with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this pronouncement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands financial statement disclosure of fair value measurements 
the statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas  as issued  are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february   the fasb released a fasb staff position no 
which delayed the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas for its financial assets and liabilities as of january   and for its nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of january   and does not currently expect a material impact on its reported financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt instruments do not expose us to material market risks relating to changes in interest rates 
some of the proceeds of our initial public offering were invested in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities pending their application 
the value of these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
the effect of a hypothetical one hundred basis point decrease across all interest rates related to our investments would result in an annual decrease of approximately million in operating results assuming no further changes in the amount of our investments outstanding at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in short term certificates of deposit and similar instruments available through our established banking relationships 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature in less than one year 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
