table of contents retirement services administration  workers compensation insurance services  health and benefits services  time and attendance solutions  and other human resource services and products 
we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed 
service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients  checks or transactions per client per pay period  and utilization of ancillary services 
we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
our strategy is focused on achieving strong long term financial performance while providing high quality  timely  accurate  and affordable services  growing our client base  increasing utilization of our ancillary services  leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure  and expanding our service offerings 
fiscal was our eighteenth consecutive year of record total revenue  net income  and diluted earnings per share 
it was also a milestone year for us as total revenue exceeded billion for the first time 
our financial results for fiscal included the following highlights diluted earnings per share increased to per share 
net income increased to million 
total revenue increased to billion 
payroll service revenue increased to billion and human resource services revenue increased to billion 
operating income increased to million 
cash flow from operations increased to million 
dividends of million were paid to stockholders  representing of net income 
in july  our board of directors the board approved a increase in our quarterly dividend payment to per share from per share 
in august  we commenced our program to repurchase up to billion of paychex  inc common stock 
we completed this program in december  repurchasing a total of million shares for billion 
our financial performance for fiscal was largely due to service revenue growth of over the prior fiscal year 
this growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth  higher check volume  price increases  and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services 
the weakening economy and declining interest rates negatively impacted our total revenues for fiscal however  continued leveraging of our expenses allowed us to achieve solid profit results during this fiscal year 
our financial performance was impacted by decreases in interest rates earned on our funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios 
the federal funds rate declined basis points in fiscal to as of may  our combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income  net  decreased for fiscal as a result of these declining rates  as well as lower corporate invested balances due to the funding of the stock repurchase program 
the combined investment portfolio earned an average rate of return of for fiscal  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k 
we invest in highly liquid  investment grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 
as of may   we had no exposure to high risk or illiquid investments 
refer to the investment portfolio overview section of this item for more information 
in addition to reporting operating income  a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure  we present operating income  net of certain items  which is a non gaap measure 
we believe operating income  net of 
table of contents certain items  is an appropriate additional measure  as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period 
it is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year s targets and measuring management s performance in connection with certain performance based compensation payments and awards 
operating income  net of certain items  excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal to increase the litigation reserve 
interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates  which are not within the control of management 
the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature 
it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period 
operating income  net of certain items  is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission sec 
as such  it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and  therefore  should not be used in isolation  but in conjunction with the gaap measure 
the use of any non gaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non gaap measure used by other companies 
operating income  net of certain items  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal we continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy

the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary

the obligations shown as other liabilities represent business acquisition reserves and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  with million in other current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred were billion  billion  and billion for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery is complete for the software and hardware  the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund 
we maintain an allowance for returns  which is based on historical data 
the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting  holding  and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including social and economic trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

table of contents we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
in fiscal and fiscal  workers compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred 
our maximum individual claims liability was  under the fiscal policy and  under the fiscal policy 
we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers compensation claims as of may  in millions prepaid expense current liability long term liability valuation of investments our investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income  net of tax  as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
however  changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security s cost basis 
on our consolidated statements of income  realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients  whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income  net 
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings  and short term securities with a p ratings  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 
we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may   resulting from acquisitions of businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
we perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter 
based on the results of our goodwill impairment review  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal or fiscal subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients inability to meet their payroll obligations 
as part of providing payroll  payroll tax administration services  and employee payment services  we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits 
electronic money fund transfers from client bank 
table of contents accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers 
we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 
contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
as of may   we had approximately million of reserves for pending litigation 
based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we deem this amount adequate 
the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment 
this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter 
in light of the litigation reserve recorded  we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 
for additional information regarding pending legal matters  refer to note m in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
stock based compensation costs effective june   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires that all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  be recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life 
we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility  both over a period equal to the expected option life 
we estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catch up adjustment recorded in the period of change  with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 
we have determined that the black scholes option pricing model  as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application  is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants 
we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model  and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value  or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards 
at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards  we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital 
we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock based awards 
we also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax position as a result of the adoption of fin on june  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially effect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer term available for sale securities 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we generally direct investments towards high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings 
we manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
as of may   we had no exposure to any sub prime mortgage securities  auction rate securities  asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds  or structured investment vehicles sivs 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we exited the auction rate market in the early fall of and have never experienced a failed auction 
our vrdns are rated a p and must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial institutions 
our current exposure to vrdn bond insurers is limited to fsa 
our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates 
during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was compared with for fiscal and for fiscal the federal funds rate decreased basis points in fiscal and was as of may  this compares to an increase in the federal funds rate of basis points in fiscal and basis points in fiscal a lower federal funds rate impacts the average interest rate we earn on our portfolios 
while interest rates are falling  the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and short term interest rate changes 
during a falling interest rate environment  the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short term investments  and over time will decrease earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from the available for sale securities  which as of may  had an average duration of years  excluding the impact of vrdns tied to short term interest rates  would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
the cost and fair value of available for sale securities that had stated maturities as of may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in millions cost fair value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically to years 
although these securities are issued as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

table of contents the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate increase first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous 
subject to these factors  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for fiscal our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and available for sale securities with an average duration of days  and invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of million as of may   compared with a net unrealized loss of million as of may  the change resulted from decreases in long term market interest rates 
during fiscal  the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of million to a net unrealized gain of million 
during fiscal  the net unrealized loss ranged from million to million 
the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately million as of july  as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value 
the weighted average yield to maturity was and  as of may  and may   respectively 
the weighted average yield to maturity excludes available for sale securities tied to short term interest rates such as auction securities and vrdns 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available for sale securities as of may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value 
this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity 
these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations  unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other than temporary 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer
