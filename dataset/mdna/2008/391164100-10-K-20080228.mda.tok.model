item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
kcp l kcp l  headquartered in kansas city  missouri  is an integrated  regulated electric utility that engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l serves approximately  customers located in all or portions of counties in western missouri and eastern kansas 
customers include approximately  residences   commercial firms  and  industrials  municipalities and other electric utilities 
kcp l s retail revenues averaged approximately of its total operating revenues over the last three years 
wholesale firm power  bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of utility revenues 
kcp l is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter 
kcp l s total electric revenues averaged approximately of great plains energy s revenues over the last three years 
kcp l s net income accounted for approximately  and of great plains energy s income from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
regulation kcp l is regulated by the mpsc and kcc with respect to retail rates  certain accounting matters  standards of service and  in certain cases  the issuance of securities  certification of facilities and service territories 
kcp l is classified as a public utility under the federal power act and accordingly  is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
by virtue of its ownership interest in wolf creek generating station wolf creek  kcp l is subject to regulation by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  with respect to licensing  operations and safety related requirements 
missouri and kansas jurisdictional retail revenues averaged and  respectively  of kcp l s total retail revenue over the last three years 
see item md a  critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters 
missouri and kansas rate case filings in november  kcp l received an order from kcc regarding its rate case filed in march in december  kcp l received an order from the mpsc regarding its rate case filed in february for information on these rate cases  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kcp l anticipates filing rate cases with the mpsc and kcc in seeking recovery of the iatan no 
environmental retrofits and overall increased costs of service 
competition missouri and kansas continue on the fully integrated utility model and no legislation authorizing retail choice has been introduced in missouri or kansas for several years 
as a result  kcp l does not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in its franchised service territory  although other sources of energy can provide alternatives to kcp l s customers 
if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice  kcp l may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations and may be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities 
kcp l competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for customers in its service territory 
in this regard  kcp l competes with owners of other generating stations and other power suppliers  principally utilities in its region  on the basis of availability and price 
kcp l s wholesale revenues averaged approximately of its total revenues over the last three years 
power supply kcp l has over  mws of generating capacity 
kcp l s maximum system net hourly summer peak load of  mw occurred on july  the maximum winter peak load of  mw occurred on december  during  the summer peak load was  mw and the winter peak load was  mw 
the projected peak summer demand for is  mw 
kcp l expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the years and with its generation assets  short term capacity purchases and demand side management and efficiency programs 
as part of its comprehensive energy plan  kcp l expects to have iatan no 
 a coal fired plant  in service in  which will add approximately mw kcp l s share to its generating capacity 
kcp l is a member of the southwest power pool  inc spp 
spp is a regional transmission organization rto mandated by ferc to ensure reliable supply of power  adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale prices of electricity 
as a member of the spp  kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its projected peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity  power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs 
the capacity margin is designed to ensure the reliability of electric energy in the spp region in the event of operational failure of power generating units utilized by the members of the spp 
fuel the principal fuel sources for kcp l s electric generation are coal and nuclear fuel 
kcp l expects  with normal weather  to satisfy approximately of its generation requirements from these sources with the remainder provided by wind  natural gas and oil 
the actual and estimated fuel mix and delivered cost in cents per net kwh generated are in the following table 
fuel cost in cents per fuel mix a net kwh generated estimated actual estimated actual fuel coal nuclear b natural gas and oil wind total generation a fuel mix based on percent of total mwhs generated 
b reflects the next scheduled refueling outage 
prior to january   less than of kcp l s rates contained an automatic fuel adjustment clause 
new kansas retail rates effective january   contain an energy cost adjustment eca tariff 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar provision 
to the extent the price of coal  coal transportation  nuclear fuel  nuclear fuel processing  natural gas or purchased power increases significantly  or if kcp l s lower fuel cost units do not meet anticipated availability levels  kcp l s net income may be adversely affected until the increased cost could be reflected in missouri retail rates 
missouri retail rates reflect a set level of non firm wholesale electric sales margin 
kcp l will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin  but any amount above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to retail customers in a future rate case 
coal during  kcp l s generating units  including jointly owned units  are projected to burn approximately million tons of coal 
kcp l has entered into coal purchase contracts with various suppliers in wyoming s powder river basin prb  the nation s principal supply region of low sulfur coal  and with local suppliers 
the coal to be provided under these contracts will satisfy almost all of the projected coal requirements for and approximately and for and  respectively 
the remainder of kcp l s coal requirements will be fulfilled through additional contracts or spot market purchases 
kcp l has entered into its coal contracts over time at higher average prices affecting coal costs for and beyond 
kcp l has also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the prb to its generating units 
the transportation services to be provided under these contracts will satisfy virtually all of the projected requirements for  approximately for and approximately for coal transportation costs are expected to increase in and beyond 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding a rate complaint case against union pacific railroad company 
nuclear fuel kcp l owns of wolf creek nuclear operating corporation wcnoc  the operating company for wolf creek  its only nuclear generating unit 
wolf creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor 
this process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies 
the owners of wolf creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium and conversion services needed to operate wolf creek through march and approximately after that date through september the owners also have under contract of the uranium enrichment and fabrication required to operate wolf creek through march management expects its cost of nuclear fuel to remain relatively stable through because of contracts in place 
from through  management anticipates the cost of nuclear fuel to increase significantly due to higher contracted prices and market conditions 
even with this anticipated increase  management expects nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated to remain less than the cost of other fuel sources 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding nuclear plant 
natural gas at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
purchased power kcp l purchases power to meet its customers needs when it does not have sufficient available generation or when the cost of purchased power is less than kcp l s cost of generation or to satisfy firm power commitments 
management believes kcp l will be able to obtain enough power to meet its future demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the spp region  however  price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand 
kcp l s purchased power  as a percent of mwh requirements  averaged approximately  and for  and  respectively 
environmental matters see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters 
strategic energy great plains energy indirectly owns of strategic energy 
strategic energy provides competitive retail electricity supply services by entering into power supply contracts to supply electricity to its end use customers 
of the states that offer retail choice  strategic energy operates in california  connecticut  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
in addition to competitive retail electricity supply services  strategic energy also provides strategic planning  consulting and billing and scheduling services in the natural gas and electricity markets 
strategic energy provides services to approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts for approximately  customers including numerous fortune companies  smaller companies and governmental entities 
strategic energy offers an array of products designed to meet the various requirements of a diverse customer base including fixed price  index based and month to month renewal products 
strategic energy s projected mwh deliveries for are in the range of million to million mwhs 
based solely on expected usage under current signed contracts  strategic energy has forecasted future mwh commitments backlog at december   of million mwh  million mwh and million mwh for the years through  respectively  and million mwh over the years through strategic energy s revenues averaged approximately of great plains energy s revenues over the last three years 
strategic energy s net income loss accounted for approximately  and of great plains energy s income from continuing operations in   and  respectively 
strategic energy s growth objective is to continue to expand in retail choice states and to increase its share of the market opportunity 
strategic energy s continued success is dependent on a number of industry and operational factors including  but not limited to  the ability to contract for wholesale mwhs to meet its customers needs at prices that are competitive with the host utility territory rates and with current and or future competitors  the ability to provide value added customer services and the ability to attract and retain employees experienced in providing service in retail choice states 
conduct strategic alternative review of strategic energy great plains energy has retained merrill lynch co 
as financial advisor to assist in a review of strategic and structural alternatives for its strategic energy subsidiary 
the alternatives may include  among others  continuation of strategic energy s current subsidiary status and business plans  joint ventures with strategic partners  acquisitions of similar businesses  or sales of part or all of strategic energy 
there is no assurance regarding which of the foregoing alternatives  if any  will be selected  or the terms of any possible joint venture  acquisition or sale 
power supply strategic energy does not own generation  transmission or distribution facilities 
strategic energy purchases electricity from power suppliers based on forecasted peak demand for its retail customers 
management believes it has adequate access to energy in the markets it serves 
regulation strategic energy  as a participant in the wholesale electricity and transmission markets  is subject to ferc jurisdiction 
additionally  strategic energy is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies in states where strategic energy is licensed to sell power 
each state has a public utility commission and rules related to retail choice 
each state s rules are distinct and may conflict 
these rules do not restrict the amount strategic energy can charge for its services  but can have an impact on strategic energy s ability to compete in any jurisdiction 
transmission in many markets  rtos independent system operators isos manage the power flows  maintain reliability and administer transmission access for the electric transmission grid in a defined region 
rtos isos coordinate and monitor communications among the generator  distributor and retail electricity provider 
additionally  rtos isos manage the real time electricity supply and demand  and direct the energy flow 
through these activities  rtos isos maintain a reliable energy supply within their region 
as a competitive retail electricity supplier  strategic energy must register with each rto iso in order to operate in the markets covered by their grids 
strategic energy primarily engages with pjm interconnection  llc pjm  new england rto formerly iso new england  california iso  new york iso  electric reliability council of texas ercot and the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso 
in some cases  rtos isos provide strategic energy with all or a combination of the data for billing  settlement  application of electricity rates and information regarding the imbalance of electricity supply 
in addition  they provide balancing energy services and ancillary services to strategic energy in the fulfillment of providing services to retail end users 
strategic energy must go through a settlement process with each rto iso in which the rto iso compares scheduled power with actual meter usage during a given time period and adjusts the original costs charged to strategic energy through a revised settlement 
all participants in the rtos isos have exposure to other market participants 
in the event of default by a market participant within the rtos isos  the uncollectible balance is generally allocated to the remaining participants in proportion to their load share 
rtos isos may continue to modify the market structure and mechanisms in an attempt to improve market efficiency 
in addition  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to strategic energy s activities 
these actions could have an effect on strategic energy s results of operations 
strategic energy participates extensively  together with other market participants  in relevant rto iso governance and regulatory issues 
revenue sufficiency guarantee rsg charges are collected by miso in order to compensate generators that are standing by to supply electricity when called upon by miso 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding rsg 
competition the principal elements of competition are price  service and product differentiation 
strategic energy operates in several retail choice electricity markets 
strategic energy has several competitors that operate in most or all of the same states in which it provides services to customers 
strategic energy also faces competition in certain markets from regional suppliers and deregulated utility affiliates formed by holding companies affiliated with regulated utilities to provide retail load in their home market territories 
strategic energy s competitors vary in size from small companies to large corporations  some of which have significantly greater financial  marketing  and procurement resources than strategic energy 
additionally  strategic energy  as well as its other competitors  must compete with the host utility in order to convince customers to switch from the host utility 
there is a regulatory lag in several rtos isos that slows the adjustment of host public utility rates in response to changes in wholesale prices  which may negatively affect strategic energy s ability to compete in a rising wholesale price environment

item a 
risk factors actual results in future periods for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l could differ materially from historical results and the forward looking statements contained in this report 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
the companies business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond the companies control 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies 
the risk factors described below  as well as the other information included in this annual report and in the other documents filed with the sec  should be carefully considered before making an investment in the company s securities 
risk factors of consolidated kcp l are also risk factors for great plains energy 
the company is subject to complex utility and environmental regulation that could adversely affect its operations 
the company is subject to  or affected by  extensive federal and state utility regulation  as described below 
the company must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations 
in the company s business planning and management of operations  it must address the effects of existing and proposed regulation on its businesses and changes in the regulatory framework  including initiatives by federal and state legislatures  regional transmission organizations  utility regulators and taxing authorities 
failure to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals  in a timely manner  adoption of new regulations by federal or state agencies  or changes to current regulations and interpretations of such regulations may materially affect the company s business and its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the outcome of kcp l s retail rate proceedings could have a material impact on its business and is largely outside its control 
the rates that kcp l is allowed to charge its customers are the single most important item influencing its results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
these rates are subject to the determination  in large part  of governmental entities outside of kcp l s control  including the mpsc  kcc and ferc 
kcp l also is exposed to cost recovery shortfalls due to the inherent lag in the rate setting process  especially during periods of significant cost inflation 
a reduction or rejection by the mpsc or kcc of rate increase requests reflecting the costs of projects under the comprehensive energy plan or collaboration agreement  which are discussed below  or other costs and expenses  could lead to lowered credit ratings  reduced access to capital markets  increased financing costs  lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and collateral security requirements 
as a part of the missouri and kansas stipulations approved by the mpsc and kcc in  kcp l began implementation of its comprehensive energy plan 
under the comprehensive energy plan  kcp l agreed to undertake certain projects  including building and owning a portion of iatan no 
 installing a new wind powered generating facility  installing environmental upgrades to certain existing plants  infrastructure improvements and demand management  distributed generation  and customer efficiency and affordability programs 
in march  kcp l entered into a collaboration agreement with the sierra club and concerned citizens of platte county that provides for increases in kcp l s wind generation capacity and energy efficiency initiatives  reductions in certain emission permit levels at its iatan and lacygne generating stations  and projects to offset certain carbon dioxide emissions 
most  but not all  of these commitments are conditioned on regulatory approval 
a reduction or rejection by the mpsc or kcc of rate increase requests reflecting the costs of projects under the comprehensive energy plan or collaboration agreement would adversely affect kcp l s results of operations  financial position  and cash flows  and the effect could be material 
the mpsc order approving an approximate million increase in annual revenues effective january   was appealed in february to the circuit court of cole county  missouri  by the office of public counsel  praxair  inc  and trigen kansas city energy corporation  seeking to set aside or remand the order to the mpsc 
the court affirmed the mpsc s decision in december and this decision has been appealed by trigen kansas city energy corporation 
although subject to the appeal  the mpsc order remains in effect pending the court s decision 
the kcp l rate increase authorized by the mpsc of million  effective january   may be appealed to the missouri courts 
parties have until march   to appeal 
if there is an appeal  it is possible that the mpsc order could be vacated and the proceedings remanded to the mpsc 
management cannot predict or provide any assurances regarding the outcome of these proceedings 
in response to competitive  economic  political  legislative and regulatory pressures  kcp l may be subject to rate moratoriums  rate refunds  limits on rate increases or rate reductions  including phase in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period of time for the benefit of customers 
any or all of these could have a significant adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
regulatory requirements regarding kcp l s utility operations may increase kcp l s costs and may expose kcp l to compliance penalties 
the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements  such as vegetation management standards  facilities inspection requirements  and quality of service standards 
the costs of new or modified operational standards and requirements could have an adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows  and could expose kcp l to penalties if it does not meet these standards and requirements 
the ability of strategic energy to compete in states offering retail choice may be materially affected by state regulations and host public utility rates 
strategic energy is a participant in the wholesale electricity and transmission markets  and is subject to ferc regulation with respect to wholesale electricity sales and transmission matters 
additionally  strategic energy is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies in states where it has retail customers 
each state has a public utility commission and rules related to retail choice 
each state s rules are distinct and may conflict 
these rules do not restrict the amount strategic energy can charge for its services  but can have an impact on strategic energy s ability to compete in any jurisdiction 
additionally  the timing and amount of changes in host public utility rates can materially affect strategic energy s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
financial market disruptions and declines in the credit ratings of great plains energy or kcp l may increase financing costs or limit access to the credit markets  which may adversely affect liquidity and results 
kcp l s capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it implements its comprehensive energy plan 
the amount of credit support required for strategic energy operations varies with a number of factors  including the amount and price of power purchased for its customers 
the amount of collateral or other credit support required under strategic energy and kcp l power supply agreements is also dependent on credit ratings 
if the proposed acquisition of aquila occurs  the future capital requirements of aquila will further increase the company s overall capital requirements 
the company relies on access to both short term money markets and long term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
the company also relies on the financial markets for credit support  such as letters of credit  to support strategic energy and kcp l operations 
great plains energy  kcp l and certain of their securities are rated by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
a decrease in these credit ratings would have an adverse impact on the company s access to capital  its cost of funds  the amount of collateral required under power supply agreements and great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
while management anticipates that great plains energy  kcp l and aquila will be rated investment grade if the proposed acquisition of aquila closes  great plains energy and kcp l credit ratings were negatively affected by the announcement of the proposed acquisition  and may be further negatively affected 
the recent sub prime mortgage issues have adversely affected the overall financial markets  generally resulting in increased credit spreads  reduced access to the capital markets and actual or potential downgrades of municipal bond insurers and the bonds insured by those insurers  among other adverse matters 
the interest rates on million aggregate principal amount of kcp l s eirr bonds are periodically reset through auction processes 
these auction rate bonds are supported by municipal bond insurance policies issued by either xl capital assurance  inc or financial guaranty insurance company 
both firms and the supported kcp l auction rate bonds were downgraded by at least two rating agencies in january and february concerns related to municipal bond insurers credit have adversely affected the ordinary course of operation of auctions for these types of bonds 
the interest rates set in recent auctions of kcp l s auction rate bonds have been adversely affected by these concerns  and the adverse effects are expected to continue until the bonds are changed to another interest rate mode 
the company s management believes that it will maintain sufficient access to the financial markets at a reasonable cost based upon current credit ratings and market conditions 
however  changes in financial or other market conditions or credit ratings could adversely affect the company s ability to access financial markets  increase borrowing costs  increase collateral or other credit support requirements  or impact the rate treatment provided to kcp l  and therefore materially affect its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
great plains energy is subject to business and regulatory uncertainties as a result of the potential acquisition of aquila  which could adversely affect its business 
on february   great plains energy entered into definitive agreements under which it would acquire all the outstanding shares of aquila 
immediately prior to this acquisition  black hills would acquire from aquila its electric utility in colorado and its gas utilities in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa 
these transactions are complex  remain subject to outstanding regulatory approvals and other conditions  and there is no assurance as to whether or when the transactions will be consummated 
while various regulatory approvals have been obtained  the approvals of the mpsc and kcc have not yet been obtained 
the timing of  and the conditions imposed by  regulatory approvals may delay or give rise to the ability to terminate the transactions 
in the event of termination  great plains energy would be required to write off its deferred transaction costs  which could be material 
the conditions imposed by regulatory approvals could increase the costs  or decrease the benefits  anticipated by great plains energy from the transaction 
uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the company 
although the company has taken steps to reduce any adverse effects  these uncertainties could impair the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate key personnel until the merger closes and for a period of time afterwards  and could cause customers  suppliers and others to seek to change existing business relationships 
the anticipated costs and benefits of the aquila transaction may not be realized  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
great plains energy entered into the aquila proposed transaction with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits to it and kcp l including  among other things  synergies  cost savings and operating efficiencies 
although great plains energy expects to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  achieving them cannot be assured 
the company expects to incur significant costs relating to the acquisition of aquila and its operational integration with kcp l 
these costs may be significantly greater than the company s estimates 
although the company has requested to recover a portion of these costs through utility rates  there is no assurance regarding the recovery of these costs or other regulatory treatment of benefits or costs in rate cases occurring after the closing of the transaction 
the company expects to achieve various benefits  including synergies  cost savings and operating efficiencies in connection with the proposed acquisition 
approximately half of the total estimated cost savings and synergies  over the first five years following the transaction are expected to come from reductions in aquila s corporate overhead and other costs currently not being recovered through aquila s missouri utility rates  and are not expected to be recovered through utility rates following the merger 
if the company is not able to eliminate these non missouri utility costs as anticipated  its results from operations will be negatively impacted 
integration of aquila and kcp l utility operations following the transaction will pose significant challenges due to the size and complexity of each organization 
the company has dedicated substantial efforts and resources since the proposed transaction was announced to plan for an efficient and successful integration of utility operations 
the company believes that it will have the necessary employees to successfully operate the integrated utility operations after the transaction closes 
however  there is no assurance that the utility operations integration will be completed successfully or in a timely manner 
most of the aquila employees remaining after the sale to black hills are expected to become employees of kcp l 
kcp l employees will operate and manage both kcp l properties and aquila s properties  and kcp l will charge aquila for the cost of these services 
these expected arrangements may pose risks to kcp l  including possible claims arising from actions of kcp l employees in operating aquila s properties and providing other services to aquila 
kcp l s claims for reimbursement for services provided to aquila will be unsecured and rank equally with other unsecured obligations of aquila 
kcp l s ability to be reimbursed for the costs incurred for the benefit of aquila depends on the financial ability of aquila to make such payments 
additionally  aquila s utility operations are subject to regulation by numerous government entities  including the mpsc and ferc 
as such  a successful acquisition of aquila will subject great plains energy to additional regulatory risk 
the announced review of alternatives for strategic energy may cause business uncertainties  which could adversely affect the company s results of operation 
strategic energy contributed of the company s consolidated revenues and of the company s consolidated net income in in november  the company announced that it was undertaking a review of strategic and structural alternatives for strategic energy 
the alternatives may include  among others  continuation of strategic energy s current subsidiary status and business plans  joint ventures with strategic partners  acquisitions of similar businesses  or sales of part or all of strategic energy 
uncertainty about the outcome of this review on strategic energy employees  suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on the company 
although the company has taken steps to reduce any adverse effects  including employee retention agreements  these uncertainties could impair the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate key personnel until the outcome of the review and for a period of time after  and could cause customers  suppliers and others to seek to terminate or change existing business relationships 
the company is subject to current and potential environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities  any or all of which may adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the company is subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities with regard to air quality and other environmental matters  primarily through kcp l s operations 
the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity produces and requires disposal of certain hazardous products  which are subject to these laws and regulations 
in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations  these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance  including fines  injunctive relief and other sanctions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
kcp l currently projects a range of capital expenditures of billion to billion kcp l s share of jointly owned units over an approximate ten year period to comply with environmental requirements regarding so  nox  mercury and particulate emissions that will take effect during that period 
the actual cost and the timing of such expenditures may be materially different than these estimates due to the risks described in this risk factor and in the risk factor regarding construction risks 
there is also a risk of new environmental laws and regulations  and judicial interpretations of environmental laws and regulations  affecting kcp l s operations 
in particular  various stakeholders  including legislators  regulators  shareholders and non governmental organizations  as well as utilities and other companies in many business sectors  are considering ways to address climate change 
these include regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to encourage or mandate the use of renewable resources  energy efficiency and demand response management 
federal and or state legislation or regulation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may be enacted in the near future 
the kansas department of health and environment has indicated that it intends to engage industries and stakeholders to establish goals for reducing co emissions and strategies to achieve those goals 
kcp l s current generation capacity is primarily coal fired  and is estimated to produce about one ton of co per mwh  or approximately million tons per year 
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may cause the company to incur material costs to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations through additional environmental control equipment  retiring and replacing existing generation  or selecting more costly generation alternatives  procure emission allowance credits  or incur taxes  fees or other governmental impositions on account of such emissions 
another area of law that is in a state of flux is the rules governing emissions of mercury 
rules issued by the environmental protection agency epa were overturned in february  and it is unclear what standards will be imposed in the future  or when we may have to comply with any new standards 
kcp l s proposed capital expenditures reflect estimated costs to comply with the overturned rule  and compliance with any new standards is likely to result in the incurrence of increased costs  although at this point there is insufficient information to estimate those costs 
other new environmental laws and regulations affecting kcp l s operations may be adopted  and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to kcp l or its facilities  any of which may adversely affect the company s business and substantially increase its environmental expenditures in the future 
new facilities  or modifications of existing facilities  may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits 
delays in the environmental permitting process  denials of permit applications  conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially affect the cost and timing of the environmental retrofit projects included in the comprehensive energy plan  among other projects  and thus materially affect kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
under current law  kcp l is also generally responsible for any on site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its facilities  including those that it has previously owned or operated  regardless of whether the liabilities arose before  during or after the time it owned or operated the facilities 
kcp l may not be able to recover all of its costs for environmental expenditures through rates in the future 
the incurrence of material environmental costs or liabilities  without related rate recovery  could have a material adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows

the federal clean air act requires companies to obtain permits and  if necessary  install control equipment to reduce emissions when making a major modification or a change in operation of an existing facility if either is expected to cause a significant net increase in regulated emissions 
the sierra club and concerned citizens of platte county have claimed that modifications were made to iatan no 
in violation of clean air act regulations 
although kcp l has entered into a collaboration agreement with those parties that provides  among other things  for the release of such claims  the collaboration agreement does not bind any other entity 
kcp l is aware of subpoenas issued by a federal grand jury to certain third parties seeking documents relating to capital projects at iatan no 
kcp l has not received a subpoena  and has not been informed of the scope of the grand jury inquiry 
the ultimate outcome of these grand jury activities cannot presently be determined  nor can the costs and other liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome presently be reasonably estimated 
failure to recover such costs through rates could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the inability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to provide sufficient dividends to allow great plains energy to pay dividends to its shareholders and meet its financial obligations would have an adverse effect 
great plains energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own 
the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries  particularly kcp l 
kcp l has committed to its state regulatory commissions to maintain a equity to total capitalization ratio  and has similar covenants in its revolving credit facility 
strategic energy also has financial covenants in its financing arrangements 
the ability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions  and accordingly great plains energy s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations  principally depends on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries  as well as on regulatory factors  financial covenants  general business conditions and other matters 
changes in customer demand  due to sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy and weather conditions may adversely affect kcp l s and strategic energy s business and financial results 
the results of operations of kcp l and strategic energy can be materially affected by changes in weather and customer demand 
kcp l and strategic energy estimate customer demand based on historical trends  to procure fuel and purchased power 
sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affects the markets in which kcp l and strategic energy operate 
declines in economic conditions may reduce overall electricity sales and or increase bad debt expense  which could materially affect kcp l s and strategic energy s results of operations and cash flows 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
in addition  severe weather  including but not limited to extreme heat or cold  tornados  snow  rain  floods and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenues 
kcp l s iatan and hawthorn stations use water from the missouri river for cooling purposes 
low water and flow levels  which have been experienced in recent years  can increase kcp l s maintenance costs at these stations and  if these levels were to get low enough  could cause kcp l to modify plant operations and or install additional equipment 
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could negatively impact great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
great plains energy  kcp l and strategic energy use derivative instruments  such as swaps  options  futures and forwards  to manage commodity and financial risks 
financial losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts  if a counterparty fails to perform  or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
changes in commodity prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risks associated with the price of electricity 
strategic energy routinely enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity in the normal course of business 
kcp l generates  purchases and sells electricity in the retail and wholesale markets 
to the extent that exposure to the price of electricity is not hedged  the company could experience losses associated with the changing market price for electricity 
increases in fuel and transportation prices could have an adverse impact on kcp l s costs 
new kansas retail rates effective january   contain an eca tariff 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar provision 
missouri retail rates reflect a set level of non firm wholesale electric sales margin 
kcp l will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin  but any amount above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to retail customers in a future rate case 
this exposes kcp l to risk from changes in the market prices of coal  natural gas  nuclear fuel and purchased power 
changes in kcp l s fuel mix due to electricity demand  plant availability  transportation issues  fuel prices  fuel availability and other factors can also adversely affect kcp l s fuel and purchased power costs 
kcp l does not hedge its entire exposure from fuel and transportation price volatility 
forward prices for coal have increased  principally due to international demand  and management expects prices will continue to increase 
management also expects its cost of nuclear fuel to increase significantly from through consequently  its results of operations and financial position may be materially impacted by changes in these prices until increased costs are recovered in missouri retail rates 
wholesale electricity prices affect costs and revenues  creating earnings volatility 
kcp l s level of wholesale sales depends on the wholesale market price  transmission availability and the availability of kcp l s generation for wholesale sales  among other factors 
a substantial portion of kcp l s wholesale sales are made in the spot market  and thus kcp l has immediate exposure to wholesale price changes 
kcp l is also exposed to price risk because at times it purchases power to meet its customers needs 
the cost of these purchases may be affected by the timing of customer demand and or unavailability of kcp l s lower priced generating units 
wholesale power prices can be volatile and generally increase in times of high regional demand and high natural gas prices 
while an allocated portion of wholesale purchases and sales are reflected in kcp l s kansas eca  kcp l s missouri rates are set on an estimated amount of wholesale sales and purchases 
kcp l will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin  but any amount above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to retail customers in a future rate case 
declines in wholesale market price or availability of generation or transmission constraints in the wholesale markets could reduce kcp l s wholesale sales and adversely affect kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
strategic energy operates in competitive retail electricity markets  competing against the host utilities and other retail suppliers 
wholesale electricity costs  which account for a significant portion of its operating expenses  can materially affect strategic energy s ability to attract and retain retail electricity customers 
there is also a regulatory lag that slows the adjustment of host public utility rates in response to changes in wholesale prices 
this lag can negatively affect strategic energy s ability to compete in a rising wholesale price environment 
strategic energy manages wholesale electricity risk by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of its positions to balance energy supply and demand  however  strategic energy does not exactly match hedges to its aggregate exposure 
this imbalance position leaves strategic energy subject to the effects of electricity price volatility 
consequently  its results of operations and financial position may be materially impacted by changes in the wholesale price of electricity 
operations risks may adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the operation of kcp l s electric generation  transmission and distribution systems involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  operating limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions  environmental or other regulatory requirements  fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions  transmission scheduling  and catastrophic events such as fires  explosions  severe weather or other similar occurrences 
with the exception of hawthorn no 
 which was substantially rebuilt in  all of kcp l s coal fired generating units and its nuclear generating unit were constructed prior to the age of these generating units increases the risk of unplanned outages and higher maintenance expense 
kcp l has implemented training  preventive maintenance and other programs  but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns or failures of kcp l s facilities 
kcp l currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover its facilities in amounts that management considers appropriate 
such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage 
insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms  and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of  or any damage to  any of kcp l s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage 
these and other operating events may reduce kcp l s revenues  increase its costs  or both  and may materially affect kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the cost and schedule of kcp l s construction projects may materially change 
kcp l s comprehensive energy plan includes the construction of an estimated mw coal fired generating plant and environmental retrofits at two existing coal fired units 
there are risks that actual costs may exceed budget estimates  delays may occur in obtaining permits and materials  suppliers and contractors may not perform as required under their contracts  there may be inadequate availability or increased cost of qualified craft labor  the scope and timing of projects may change  and other events beyond kcp l s control may occur that may materially affect the schedule  budget and performance of these projects 
the construction projects contemplated in the comprehensive energy plan rely upon the supply of a significant percentage of materials from overseas sources 
this global procurement subjects the delivery of procured material to issues beyond what would be expected if such material were supplied from sources within the united states 
these risks include  but are not limited to  delays in clearing customs  ocean transportation  currency exchange rates and potential civil unrest in sourcing countries  among others 
the demand for environmental projects  similar to those in the comprehensive energy plan  has increased substantially with many utilities in the united states starting similar projects to address changing environmental regulations 
this demand has constrained labor and material resources for such projects  and there is a risk that such constraints may increase 
these and other risks could materially increase the estimated costs of these construction projects  delay the in service dates of these projects  adversely affect the performance of the projects  and or require kcp l to purchase additional electricity to supply its retail customers until the projects are completed 
kcp l is not permitted to start recovering the costs of these projects until they are completed and put into service 
thus  these risks may materially affect kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the anticipated acquisition of aquila will increase great plains energy s ownership of iatan nos 
and aquila owns of both iatan generating units 
great plains energy s post acquisition ownership percentages of the iatan generating units would be of iatan no 
and of iatan no 
 which would expose the company to greater risks associated with the ongoing iatan construction projects 
failure of one or more generation plant co owners to pay their share of construction  operations and maintenance costs could increase kcp l s costs and capital requirements 
kcp l owns of wolf creek  of lacygne station  of iatan no 
and of iatan no 
the remaining portions of these facilities are owned by other utilities that are contractually obligated to pay their proportionate share of capital and other costs and  in the case of iatan no 
 construction costs 
while the ownership agreements provide that a defaulting co owner s share of the electricity generated can be sold by the non defaulting co owners  there is no assurance that the revenues received will recover the increased costs borne by the non defaulting co owners 
the iatan no 
co owners have provided financial assurances related to their respective construction cost obligations  but there is a risk that such assurances may not be sufficient in the event of a co owner default 
during the construction period  the iatan no 
agreements provide for re allocations of part or all of a defaulting co owner s share of the facility to the non defaulting owners  which would increase the capital requirements  operations and maintenance costs of the non defaulting owners 
occurrence of these or other events could materially increase kcp l s costs and capital requirements 
an aging workforce and increasing demand for skilled craft labor poses operational and planning challenges to kcp l 
through  approximately of kcp l s current employees will be eligible to retire with full pension benefits 
this is a general industry issue  which has increased the demand for and cost of skilled craft labor for both companies and contractors 
kcp l uses contractors for a substantial portion of its construction and maintenance work 
failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees  including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees  or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect kcp l s ability to manage and operate its business 
substantially all of kcp l s employees participate in defined benefit and post retirement plans 
if kcp l employees retire when they become eligible for retirement through  or if kcp l s plans experience adverse market returns on investments  or if interest rates materially fall  kcp l s contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels 
in addition  assumptions related to future costs  returns on investments  interest rates and other actuarial assumptions  including projected retirements  have a significant impact on kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the pension protection act of alters the manner in which pension plan assets and liabilities are valued for purposes of calculating required pension contributions and changes the timing of required contributions to underfunded plans 
the funding rules  which became effective in  could significantly affect the company s funding requirements 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has a project to reconsider the accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits 
this project may result in accelerated expense 
kcp l is exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  which could result in an adverse effect on the company s and kcp l s business and financial results 
kcp l owns mw of wolf creek 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities  including wolf creek 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  shut down the facilities  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
any revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could result in substantial capital expenditures at wolf creek 
wolf creek has the lowest fuel cost per mwh of any of kcp l s generating units 
although not expected  an extended outage of wolf creek  whether resulting from nrc action  an incident at the plant or otherwise  could have a substantial adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations and financial position in the event kcp l incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates 
if a long term outage occurred  the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base 
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes kcp l to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit s life 
kcp l contributes annually to a tax qualified trust fund to be used to decommission wolf creek 
the funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets 
if the actual return on trust assets is below the anticipated level  kcp l could be responsible for the balance of funds required  however  should this happen  management believes a rate increase would be allowed ensuring full recovery of decommissioning costs over the remaining life of the unit 
kcp l is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  including  but not limited to  potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  and to potential retrospective assessments and losses in excess of insurance coverage 
kcp l s participation in the spp could increase costs  reduce revenues  and reduce kcp l s control over its transmission assets 
functional control of the kcp l transmission systems was transferred to the spp during the third quarter of kcp l may be required to incur expenses or expand its transmission systems  which it would seek recovery for through rate increases  according to decisions made by the spp rather than according to its internal planning process 
the sale of power in the spp energy imbalance service eis market may result in unanticipated transmission congestion and other settlement charges 
there is also uncertainty regarding the impact of ongoing rto developments at ferc 
kcp l is unable to predict the impact these issues could have on its results of operations and financial position 
strategic energy operates in competitive retail electricity markets  which could impact financial results 
strategic energy has several competitors that operate in most or all of the same states in which it serves customers 
it also faces competition in certain markets from regional suppliers and deregulated utility affiliates formed by holding companies affiliated with regulated utilities to provide retail load in their home market territories 
strategic energy s competitors vary in size from small companies to large corporations  some of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and procurement resources than strategic energy 
additionally  strategic energy must compete with the host utility in order to convince customers to switch from the host utility to strategic energy as their electric service provider 
strategic energy s results of operations and financial position are impacted by the success strategic energy has in attracting and retaining customers in these markets 
strategic energy supplier and customer credit risk may adversely affect financial results 
strategic energy has credit risk exposure in the form of the loss that it could incur if a counterparty failed to perform under its contractual obligations 
strategic energy has two types of counterparty risk supplier risk and customer risk 
strategic energy enters into forward contracts with multiple suppliers 
in the event of supplier non delivery or default  strategic energy s results of operations may be affected to the extent the cost of replacement power exceeded the combination of the contracted price with the supplier and the amount of collateral held by strategic energy to mitigate its credit risk with the supplier 
strategic energy s results of operations may also be affected  in a given period  if it were required to make a payment upon termination of a supplier contract to the extent the contracted price with the supplier exceeded the market value of the contract at the time of termination 
strategic energy has also experienced an increase in customer bad debt expense  primarily related to its small business customer segment 
strategic energy has taken steps to address this exposure  but there can be no assurance that bad debt expense will be reduced 
failure of suppliers or customers to perform their obligations may adversely affect results of operations 
the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted 
an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s financial condition 
great plains energy and kcp l are party to various material litigation and regulatory matters arising out of their business operations 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined  nor  in many cases  can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated 
the liability that great plains energy and kcp l may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and  as a result  these matters may have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of great plains energy  kcp l or both

executive summary description of business great plains energy is a public utility holding company and does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s direct subsidiaries with operations or active subsidiaries are kcp l  klt inc  iec and services 
as a diversified energy company  great plains energy s reportable business segments include kcp l and strategic energy 
kcp l kcp l is an integrated  regulated electric utility that engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l has over  mws of generating capacity and has transmission and distribution facilities that provide electricity to approximately  customers in the states of missouri and kansas 
kcp l has continued to experience modest load growth 
load growth consists of higher usage per customer and the addition of new customers 
retail electricity rates are below the national average 
kcp l s nuclear unit  wolf creek  accounts for approximately of its base load capacity 
in  wcnoc submitted an application for a new operating license for wolf creek with the nrc  which would extend wolf creek s operating period to the nrc may take up to two years to rule on the application 
wolf creek s most recent refueling outage was in october and lasted days 
the next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in march strategic energy great plains energy indirectly owns of strategic energy 
strategic energy does not own generation  transmission or distribution facilities 
strategic energy provides competitive retail electricity supply services by entering into power supply contracts to supply electricity to its end use customers 
of the states that offer retail choice  strategic energy operates in california  connecticut  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
strategic energy also provides strategic planning  consulting and billing and scheduling services in the natural gas and electricity markets 
strategic energy provides services to approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts for approximately  customers including numerous fortune companies  smaller companies and governmental entities 
strategic energy offers an array of products designed to meet the various requirements of a diverse customer base including fixed price  index based and month to month renewal products 
strategic energy s volume based customer retention rate  excluding month to month customers on market based rates for was 
the corresponding volume based customer retention rates including month to month customers on market based rates was 
strategic energy deliberately reduced sales in certain markets and customer segments during the year and  consequently  experienced lower retention rates than previous years 
management has focused sales and marketing efforts on states that currently provide a more competitive pricing environment in relation to host utility default rates 
as a result  total forecasted future mwh commitments backlog grew to million mwh at december   compared to million mwh at december  based solely on expected mwh usage under current signed contracts  strategic energy has backlog of million mwh  million mwh and million mwh for the years through  respectively  and million mwh over the years through strategic energy s projected mwh deliveries for are in the range of million to million mwhs 
strategic energy expects to deliver additional mwhs above amounts currently in backlog through new and renewed term contracts and mwh deliveries to month to month customers 
strategic energy currently expects the average retail gross margin per mwh delivered retail revenues less retail purchased power divided by retail mwhs delivered in to average to 
this range excludes unrealized changes in fair value of non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness because management does not predict the future impact of these unrealized changes 
actual retail gross margin per mwh may differ from these estimates 
earnings overview great plains energy s earnings of million  or per diluted share  were up from earnings of million  or per diluted share 
earnings in were favorably impacted by weather  increased wholesale revenues  new retail rates  and increased customer usage at kcp l  as well as higher delivered volumes and an increase in changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness at strategic energy 
these favorable impacts more than offset the impact of plant outages during the first and second quarters at kcp l  higher consolidated operating expense and interest expense  and higher power prices  a first quarter resettlement charge  customer attrition in the small customer segment  and higher bad debt expense at strategic energy 
strategic focus close aquila transaction in february  great plains energy entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of aquila for in cash plus of a share of great plains energy common stock for each share of aquila common stock 
immediately prior to great plains energy s acquisition of aquila  black hills will acquire aquila s electric utility in colorado and its gas utilities in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa plus associated liabilities for a total of million in cash  subject to closing adjustments 
each of the two transactions is conditioned on the completion of the other transaction and is expected to close in the first half of activity related to the aquila transactions included the following in  great plains energy  kcp l and aquila filed joint applications with the mpsc and kcc for approval of the acquisition of aquila by great plains energy 
evidentiary hearings in missouri began in december  but recessed to allow great plains energy  kcp l and aquila time to develop a modified proposal that addresses many of the concerns of various parties represented in the proceeding 
in february  a revised proposal was submitted and hearings were requested to reconvene in late april also in february  a settlement was reached with the parties in the kcc proceedings and submitted to kcc 
decisions in both cases are currently anticipated in the first half of in  aquila and black hills filed applications with the colorado public utilities commission cpuc  kcc  the nebraska public service commission npsc and the iowa utilities board iub seeking approval of the sale of assets to black hills 
the cpuc  iub and npsc have approved the sale of assets and a settlement has been submitted in the kcc proceedings 
in  great plains energy  kcp l  aquila and black hills filed a joint application with ferc for approval of the transactions  which was granted 
in july  great plains energy  aquila and black hills submitted their respective hart scott rodino pre merger notifications and received early termination of the waiting period on august  in october  great plains energy received approval from its shareholders to issue common stock in connection with the anticipated acquisition of aquila and aquila s shareholders approved the acquisition of aquila by great plains energy 
great plains energy is focused on closing the transaction and on achieving operational integration people  processes and systems throughout to maximize synergies

kcp l s comprehensive energy plan kcp l continues to execute on its comprehensive energy plan 
the first phase of environmental upgrades at lacygne no 
 installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment  was completed and placed into service during the second quarter of environmental upgrades at iatan no 
are underway and completion is currently scheduled for late an outage at iatan no

projects is challenging  particularly the tight market conditions for skilled labor and the lengthening lead times for deliveries of materials 
kcp l is conducting a thorough assessment of the impact of the current environment on the projects cost and schedule 
the results of the assessment are expected to be available in the second quarter of in march  kcp l  the sierra club and the concerned citizens of platte county entered into a collaboration agreement that resolved disputes among the parties and kcp l agreed to pursue a set of initiatives including energy efficiency  additional wind generation  lower emission permit levels at its iatan and lacygne generating stations and other initiatives designed to offset carbon dioxide emissions 
under the collaboration agreement  kcp l will  among other things  pursue increasing its wind generation capacity by mw by year end and another mw by year end  subject to regulatory approval 
in april  kcp l issued a request for proposals to develop mw of wind generation in missouri and or kansas 
this request was an outgrowth of commitments under the comprehensive energy plan 
as with any large investment of this type  part of the planning and evaluation involves financing considerations 
difficulties impacting the credit markets are ongoing and consequently  kcp l s management believes the prudent business decision is not to move forward with wind construction in this decision will not  however  impact kcp l s commitment to pursue additional wind generation 
kcp l is focusing on development of the next phase of its comprehensive energy plan  which includes developing a long range resource plan and filing an integrated resource plan in missouri in the third quarter of  continuing to engage community groups and regulators to develop energy efficiency and demand response as a resource alternative and continuing development of environmental and renewable generation alternatives 
conduct strategic alternative review of strategic energy great plains energy has retained merrill lynch co 
as financial advisor to assist in a review of strategic and structural alternatives for its strategic energy subsidiary 
the alternatives may include  among others  continuation of strategic energy s current subsidiary status and business plans  joint ventures with strategic partners  acquisitions of similar businesses  or sales of part or all of strategic energy 
there is no assurance regarding which of the foregoing alternatives  if any  will be selected  or the terms of any possible joint venture  acquisition or sale 
kcp l regulatory proceedings in december  kcp l received a rate order from the mpsc authorizing an annual rate increase of million 
in november  kcp l received a rate order from kcc authorizing an annual rate increase of million 
the kcc order also includes an eca 
the eca tariff will reflect the projected annual amount of fuel  purchased power  emission allowances  transmission costs and asset based off system wholesale sales margin  subject to quarterly re forecasts 
any difference between the eca revenue collected and the actual eca amounts for a given year which may be positive or negative will be recovered from or refunded to kansas retail customers over twelve months beginning april of the succeeding year 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar provision 
in addition  any non firm wholesale electric sales margin above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be recorded as a regulatory liability and returned to retail customers in a future rate case 
the ordered rates were implemented january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pensions great plains energy and consolidated kcp l incur significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan  earnings on plan assets and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
these actuarial assumptions are updated annually at the beginning of the plan year 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation was considered 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan 
these assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment  however  material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a increase or a decrease in key actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects the impact based on a change in that assumption only 
impact on impact on projected change in benefit pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease pension expense for kcp l is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the mpsc and kcc 
the orders allow the difference between pension costs under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds  as appropriate 
kcp l recorded pension expense of million after allocations to the other joint owners of generating facilities and capitalized amounts in accordance with the mpsc and kcc rate orders 
expected pension expense will approximate million after allocations to the other joint owners of generating facilities and capitalized amounts consistent with the mpsc and kcc rate orders 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan 
it is difficult to predict future pension costs  changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to volatile market conditions 
regulatory matters as a regulated utility  kcp l is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  kcp l has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts imposed by rate actions of kcp l s regulators that may require refunds to customers  amounts provided in current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future for which kcp l remains accountable  or a gain or other reduction of allowable costs to be given to customers over future periods 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
future reductions in revenue or refunds for regulatory liabilities generally are not mandated  pending future rate proceedings or actions by the regulators 
management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc  kcc or ferc on kcp l s rate case filings  decisions in other regulatory proceedings  including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to kcp l  and changes in laws and regulations 
if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations 
kcp l s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to a deregulated portion of kcp l s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets as determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

energy and energy related contract accounting strategic energy generally purchases power under forward physical delivery contracts to supply electricity to its retail energy customers under full requirement sales contracts 
the full requirements sales contracts and the forward physical delivery contracts meet the accounting definition of a derivative  however  strategic energy applies the normal purchases and normal sales npns exception accounting treatment on full requirement sales contracts 
derivative contracts designated as npns are accounted for by accrual accounting  which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the underlying contract settles 
strategic energy designates forward physical delivery contracts that do not meet the requirements for the npns exception as cash flow hedges 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the fair value of the contract is recorded as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on a net basis in other comprehensive income oci and subsequently reclassified to purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income as the power is delivered and or the contract settles 
accounting for derivatives as cash flow hedges or as npns transactions may affect the timing and nature of accounting recognition  but does not change the underlying economic results 
the fair value of forward purchase derivative contracts that do not meet the requirements for the npns exception or cash flow hedge accounting are recorded as current or long term derivative assets or liabilities 
changes in the fair value of these contracts could result in operating income volatility as changes in the associated derivative assets and liabilities are recorded in purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statements of income 
strategic energy s derivative assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices 
the market prices used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering time  volatility and historical trends 
future market prices may vary from those used in recording energy assets and liabilities at fair value and such variations could be significant 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors 
changes in market prices will affect the recorded fair value of energy contracts 
changes in the fair value of energy contracts will affect operating income in the period of the change for contracts under fair value accounting and oci in the period of change for contracts under cash flow hedge accounting  while changes in forward market prices related to contracts under accrual accounting will affect operating income in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
management cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could be either favorable or unfavorable

additionally  in kcp l recorded million of skill set realignment costs and in received authorization from the mpsc and kcc to defer and amortize million of these costs 
strategic energy had net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in due to the impact of a million after tax increase in changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness 
partially offsetting this increase to net income was increased purchased power associated with a resettlement attributable to under reported deliveries and the disposition of previously acquired power at lower than contracted prices caused by early terminations in the small business segment and the absence of supplier contract settlements 
strategic energy also experienced increased bad debt expense in the small business segment and recognized penalty expense related to the purchased power adjustment for under reported deliveries 
great plains energy s other non regulated activities recognized an additional million loss in compared to  which was primarily attributable to a decline in available tax credits from affordable housing investments and overall higher expenses at the holding company  including million of transition costs related to the anticipated acquisition of aquila  and a million after tax loss for the fair value of forward starting swaps fss entered into by great plains energy during compared to great plains energy s earnings available for common shareholders decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per share  in a higher average number of common shares  primarily due to the issuance of million shares in may  diluted earnings per share by 
consolidated kcp l s net income increased million in compared to due to increased retail revenues and decreased purchase power expense 
these increases to net income were partially offset by costs related to skill set realignments  increased fuel expense and higher income taxes due to higher pre tax income in and a decrease in income taxes reflecting a reduction in kcp l s deferred tax balances as a result of a reduction in kcp l s composite tax rate 
strategic energy had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in the net loss was primarily the result of the after tax impact of million of changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
additionally  retail mwhs delivered decreased in compared to  but the impact to net income was partially offset by higher average retail gross margins per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar provision 
missouri retail rates reflect a set level of non firm wholesale electric sales margin 
kcp l will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin  but any amount above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to retail customers in a future rate case 
generation fuel mix can substantially change the fuel cost per mwh generated 
nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated is substantially less than the cost of coal per mwh generated  which is significantly lower than the cost of natural gas and oil per mwh generated 
the cost per mwh for purchased power is generally significantly higher than the cost per mwh of coal and nuclear generation 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply and purchased power  and the requirements of other electric systems to provide reliable power economically

strategic energy results of operations the following table summarizes strategic energy s comparative results of operations 
millions operating revenues purchased power other operating expenses depreciation and amortization loss on property operating income loss non operating income and expenses interest charges income taxes net income loss retail mwhs delivered increased to million in compared to million mwhs delivered in the retail mwhs delivered decreased compared to due to the effect of market conditions in midwestern states and competition in other markets where strategic energy serves customers 
management has focused sales and marketing efforts on states that currently provide a more competitive pricing environment in relation to host utility default rates resulting in increased mwh deliveries in strategic energy had net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in due to the impact of a million after tax increase in changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness 
partially offsetting this increase to net income was increased purchased power associated with a resettlement attributable to under reported deliveries and the disposition of previously acquired power at lower than contracted prices caused by early terminations in the small business segment and the absence of supplier contract settlements 
strategic energy also experienced increased bad debt expense in the small business segment and recognized penalty expense related to the purchased power adjustment for under reported deliveries 
strategic energy s net loss was primarily the result of the after tax impact of million in changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
additionally  strategic energy s other operating expenses increased compared to primarily due to increased incentive compensation and bad debt expense 
average retail gross margin per mwh without fair value impacts as detailed in the table below  the average retail gross margin per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses decreased to in compared to in this decrease is attributable to the disposition of previously acquired power at lower than contracted prices caused by early terminations in the small business segment  increased purchased power expense associated with a resettlement attributable to under reported deliveries and the absence of settlements of supplier contracts 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in net seca recoveries 
average retail gross margin per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses increased to in compared to in the increase was primarily due to the net impact of seca recoveries and charges as compared to the net seca impact increased average retail gross margin per mwh by in and decreased average retail gross margin per mwh by in additional impacts to the average retail gross margin per mwh included increases primarily due to the management of retail portfolio load requirements  favorable product mix and settlements of supplier contracts 
the increases were partially offset by higher customer acquisition costs in average retail gross margin per mwh change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness average retail gross margin per mwh without fair value impacts average retail gross margin per mwh without fair value impacts is a non gaap financial measure that differs from gaap because it excludes the impact of unrealized fair value gains or losses 
fair value impacts result from changes in fair value of non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness associated with mwhs under contract but not yet delivered 
by not reflecting the impact of unrealized fair value gains or losses  this non gaap financial measure does not reflect the volatility recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income as a result of the unrealized fair value gains or losses in the periods presented related to energy under contract for future delivery to customers 
the fair value of energy under contract but not yet delivered fluctuates from the time the contract is entered into until the energy is delivered to customers 
however  the ultimate value realized by strategic energy under the customer sales contracts is determined when the electricity supply contract settles at the originally contracted price at the time of delivery to customers 
management and the board of directors use this non gaap financial measure as a measurement of strategic energy s realized retail gross margin per delivered mwh  which are settled at contracted prices upon delivery 
because certain of strategic energy s derivative supply contracts do not meet the requirements for cash flow hedge designation and certain other derivative supply contracts designated as cash flow hedges have a level of ineffectiveness  strategic energy recognizes unrealized gains or losses during the term of these derivative supply contracts prior to delivery while the associated customer sales contracts are not subject to fair value accounting treatment and therefore do not result in unrecognized gains or losses being recorded during the term prior to delivery 
by removing these non cash timing differences that occur during the term of the contracts prior to delivery and impact only one side of the overall buy sell transaction  management believes this non gaap financial measure provides investors with a measure of average retail gross margin per mwh that more accurately reflects strategic energy s realized margin on delivered mwhs 
strategic energy purchased power purchased power is the cost component of strategic energy s average retail gross margin 
the cost of supplying electric service to retail customers can vary widely by geographic market 
this variability can be affected by many factors  including  but not limited to  geographic differences in the cost per mwh of purchased power  renewable energy requirements and capacity charges due to regional purchased power availability  requirements of other electricity providers and differences in transmission charges 
strategic energy purchases electricity from power suppliers based on forecasted peak demand for its retail customers 
actual customer demand does not always equate to the volume purchased based on forecasted peak demand 
consequently  strategic energy makes short term power purchases in the wholesale market when necessary to meet actual customer requirements 
strategic energy also sells any excess retail electricity supply over actual customer requirements back into the wholesale market 
these sales occur on many contracts  are usually short term power sales day ahead and typically settle within the reporting period 
excess retail electricity supply sales also include long term and short term forward physical sales to wholesale counterparties  which are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
strategic energy typically executes these transactions to manage basis and credit risks 
the proceeds from excess retail supply sales are recorded as a reduction of purchased power  as they do not represent the quantity of electricity consumed by strategic energy s customers 
the amount of excess retail supply sales that reduced purchased power was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  in certain markets  strategic energy is required to sell to and purchase power from a rto iso rather than directly transact with suppliers and end use customers 
the sale and purchase activity related to these certain rto iso markets is reflected on a net basis in strategic energy s purchased power 
strategic energy utilizes derivative instruments  including forward physical delivery contracts  in the procurement of electricity 
purchased power is also impacted by the net change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
net changes in fair value reduced purchased power expenses by million in  increased expenses by million in and reduced expenses by million in these changes are a result of volatility in the forward market prices for power 
also in  strategic energy prospectively began designating more derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that historically were accounted for by the npns election 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
strategic energy other operating expenses including selling  general and administrative non regulated and general taxes strategic energy s other operating expenses increased million in compared to due to a million increase in bad debt expense primarily attributable to the small business segment  which has a higher default rate than strategic energy s larger customers  combined with penalty expense related to the purchased power adjustment for under reported deliveries partially offset by lower employee related expenses 
strategic energy s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to a million increase for incentive compensation and a million increase in bad debt expense due to the charge off of smaller customers  which have a higher default rate than strategic energy s larger customers 
during  strategic energy significantly expanded its small customer business with approximately of new sales in to small customers 
in  strategic energy implemented a stronger credit screening policy and shorter permissible contract lengths in the small business segment and as a result  only of new sales in were attributable to small customers 
strategic energy income taxes strategic energy had tax expense of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in due to pre tax income in compared to a pre tax loss in the deferred tax expense related to the net changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness was million in compared to a tax benefit of million for the same period in strategic energy had a tax benefit of million in compared to tax expense of million in due to a pre tax loss in compared to pre tax income in the change was driven by a million deferred tax benefit in related to the net changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l significant balance sheet changes december  compared to december  great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s receivables increased million and million  respectively 
kcp l s receivables increased million due to additional receivables from joint owners of comprehensive energy plan projects  million mostly attributable to new retail rates effective january   million due to an increase in wholesale sales and a million increase in intercompany receivables from great plains energy 
strategic energy s receivables increased million primarily due to increased mwh deliveries at higher prices partially offset by a higher allowance for doubtful accounts primarily due to aging of the small business customer segment 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s fuel inventories increased million primarily due to increased coal inventory due to plant outages as well as increased coal and coal transportation costs 
great plains energy s deferred income taxes current assets decreased million primarily due to temporary differences resulting from changes in the fair value of strategic energy s energy related derivative instruments of million 
great plains energy s net liability for derivative instruments  including current and deferred assets and liabilities  decreased million 
the fair value of strategic energy s energy related derivative instruments increased million  which decreased the net liability 
this decrease to the net liability was partially offset by a million increase in the net liability for the fair value of an fss entered into in by great plains energy and an increase at consolidated kcp l 
consolidated kcp l s net liability for derivative instruments  including current assets and current liabilities  increased million primarily related to the fair value of a treasury lock t lock entered into in great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s construction work in progress increased million primarily due to a million increase related to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan  including million related to the construction of iatan no 
and million for environmental upgrades 
great plains energy s other deferred charges and other assets increased million primarily due to deferred costs associated with great plains energy s anticipated acquisition of aquila 
great plains energy s notes payable increased million due to borrowings on its short term credit facility used to settle a forward sale agreement for million with the remainder due to the timing of cash payments 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s commercial paper increased million primarily to support expenditures related to the comprehensive energy plan 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s current maturities of long term debt decreased million and million  respectively  due to great plains energy s settlement of the feline prides senior notes by issuing million of common stock and kcp l s repayment of million of senior notes at maturity 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s accounts payable increased million and million  respectively  primarily due to a million increase in payables related to the comprehensive energy plan 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s regulatory liabilities increased million primarily due to kcp l s regulatory treatment of so emission allowance sales totaling million in great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s other deferred credits and other liabilities increased million and million  respectively  primarily due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
consolidated kcp l s common stock increased million due to an equity contribution from great plains energy 
great plains energy s accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased million primarily due to changes in the fair value of strategic energy s energy related derivative instruments due to volatility in the forward market prices for power partially offset by activity at consolidated kcp l 
consolidated kcp l s accumulated other comprehensive income at december   decreased million resulting in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december   due to the fair value of a t lock entered into during great plains energy s long term debt increased million due to great plains energy s issuance of million of senior notes and an increase at consolidated kcp l 
consolidated kcp l s long term debt increased million reflecting the issuance of million of senior notes and the issuance of million of eirr bonds series a and b 
the proceeds from the issuance of million eirr bonds series a and b were used for the repayment of million of series a  b and d eirr bonds in that were classified as current maturities at december  capital requirements and liquidity great plains energy operates through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of its securities 
great plains energy s capital requirements are principally comprised of kcp l s utility construction and other capital expenditures  debt maturities and credit support provided to strategic energy 
these items as well as additional cash and capital requirements for the companies are discussed below 
great plains energy s liquid resources at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents on hand  including million at consolidated kcp l  and million of unused bank lines of credit 
the unused lines consisted of million from kcp l s revolving credit facility  million from strategic energy s revolving credit facility and receivables facility and million from great plains energy s revolving credit facility

kcp l currently expects to fund its comprehensive energy plan from a combination of internal and external sources including  but not limited to  contributions from rate increases  capital contributions to kcp l from great plains energy s security issuances and new short and long term debt financing 
kcp l s capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it funds the comprehensive energy plan 
kcp l expects to meet day to day cash flow requirements including interest payments  construction requirements excluding its comprehensive energy plan  dividends to great plains energy and pension benefit plan funding requirements  discussed below  with internally generated funds 
kcp l may not be able to meet these requirements with internally generated funds because of the effect of inflation on operating expenses  the level of mwh sales  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and the availability of generating units 
the funds great plains energy and consolidated kcp l need to retire maturing debt will be provided from operations  the issuance of long and short term debt and or the issuance of equity or equity linked instruments 
in addition  the company may issue debt  equity and or equity linked instruments to finance growth or take advantage of new opportunities 
strategic energy expects to meet day to day cash flow requirements including interest payments  credit support fees and capital expenditures with internally generated funds 
strategic energy may not be able to meet these requirements with internally generated funds because of the effect of inflation on operating expenses  the level of mwh sales  seasonal working capital requirements  commodity price volatility and the effects of counterparty non performance 
in february  great plains energy entered into an agreement to acquire aquila 
if the proposed acquisition of aquila occurs  the future capital requirements of aquila will further increase great plains energy s capital requirements

additionally in  kcp l received million of litigation recoveries related to hawthorn no 
 compared to million of insurance recoveries received in cash flows from financing activities great plains energy s cash flows from financing activities in reflect consolidated kcp l s repayment and issuance of senior notes  great plains energy s issuance  at a discount  of million of senior notes that mature in  an increase in short term borrowings and the million settlement of an equity forward contract at great plains energy 
consolidated kcp l s cash flows from financing activities in reflect kcp l s repayment of its million of senior notes at maturity  issuance  at a discount  of million of senior notes that mature in  and an increase in short term borrowings 
consolidated kcp l s short term borrowings have increased primarily to support expenditures related to the comprehensive energy plan 
great plains energy s cash flows from financing activities in reflect great plains energy s proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock at per share in may fees related to this issuance were million 
great plains energy used the proceeds to make a million equity contribution to kcp l 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l s net cash from financing activities in compared to increased due to an increase in kcp l s short term borrowings primarily to support expenditures related to the comprehensive energy plan 
consolidated kcp l s net cash from financing activities also increased due to a million decrease in dividends paid to great plains energy 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s cash flows from financing activities in reflect kcp l s issuance of million of unsecured senior notes  million of secured eirr bonds series and million of unsecured eirr bonds series the proceeds from these issuances were used to repay million of unsecured senior notes  million of secured series eirr bonds and million of series c eirr bonds

in february  kcp l received authorization from the mpsc to increase the million authorization to billion through december  in december  ferc authorized kcp l to have outstanding at any time up to a total of million in short term debt instruments through december the authorization is subject to four restrictions i proceeds of debt backed by utility assets must be used for utility purposes  ii if any utility assets that secure authorized debt are divested or spun off  the debt must follow the assets and also be divested or spun off  iii if any proceeds of the authorized debt are used for non utility purposes  the debt must follow the non utility assets specifically  if the non utility assets are divested or spun off  then a proportionate share of the debt must follow the divested or spun off non utility assets  and iv if utility assets financed by the authorized short term debt are divested or spun off to another entity  a proportionate share of the debt must also be divested or spun off 
significant financing activities great plains energy great plains energy has an effective shelf registration statement for the sale of unspecified amounts of securities that was filed and became effective in may during  great plains energy issued million of unsecured senior notes 
great plains energy used the proceeds to make a million equity contribution to kcp l 
in february  great plains energy exercised its rights to redeem its million feline prides senior notes in full satisfaction of each holder s obligation to purchase the company s common stock under the purchase contracts and issued million shares of common stock to the holders of the feline prides purchase contracts 
in  great plains energy also entered into a forward sale agreement with merrill lynch financial markets  inc forward purchaser for million shares of great plains energy common stock 
in april  great plains energy elected to terminate the forward sale agreement and settle it in cash 
based on the difference between great plains energy s average stock price of over the period used to determine the settlement and the then applicable forward price of  great plains energy paid million to merrill lynch financial markets  inc in  great plains energy entered into three fss  with a total notional amount of million  to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on future issuances of long term debt 
the long term debt issuance is contingent on the consummation of the acquisition of aquila 
the fss was designed to effectively remove most of the interest rate and to the extent that swap spreads correlate with credit spreads  some degree of credit spread uncertainty with respect to the debt to be issued  thereby enabling great plains energy to predict with greater assurance its future interest costs on that debt 
kcp l kcp l has an effective shelf registration statement providing for the sale of up to million of investment grade notes and general mortgage bonds that became effective in january this is intended to preserve kcp l s flexibility to access the debt capital markets 
in  kcp l s million of unsecured eirr bonds series a and b were issued 
the bonds mature on september   and will bear interest as determined through day auction periods 
the eirr bonds series a and b are covered by a municipal bond insurance policy issued by financial guaranty insurance company fgic 
the insurance agreement between kcp l and fgic provides for reimbursement by kcp l for any amounts that fgic pays under the municipal bond insurance policy 
the insurance policy is in effect for the term of the bonds 
the policy also restricts the amount of secured debt kcp l may issue 
in the event kcp l issues debt secured by liens not permitted by the agreement  kcp l is required to issue and deliver to fgic first mortgage bonds or similar securities equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the eirr bonds series a and b then outstanding 
the proceeds from the issuance of million eirr bonds series a and b were used for the repayment of million of series a  b and d eirr bonds 
in  kcp l issued million of unsecured senior notes 
the proceeds from this issuance were used to repay a short term intercompany loan from great plains energy 
kcp l used the proceeds from the intercompany loan to repay its million unsecured senior notes at maturity 
in  great plains energy entered into three t locks with a notional amount of million  to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on the us treasury rate component on future issuances of long term debt 
following a change in financing plans  great plains energy assigned the t locks to kcp l 
the t locks will settle simultaneously with the issuance of future long term fixed rate debt issued by kcp l 
the t locks remove the uncertainty with respect to the us treasury rate component of the debt to be issued  thereby enabling kcp l to predict with greater assurance its future interest costs on that debt 
debt agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of great plains energy s  kcp l s and strategic energy s revolving credit facilities

pensions the company maintains defined benefit plans for substantially all employees of kcp l  services and wcnoc and incurs significant costs in providing the plans  with the majority incurred by kcp l 
funding of the plans equals or exceeds the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
the company contributed million to the plans in to meet erisa funding requirements 
in  the company contributed million to the plans  which included million of funding above the minimum erisa funding requirements 
the and contributions were paid by kcp l 
the company expects to contribute million to the plans in to satisfy the funding requirements of erisa and the mpsc and kcc rate orders  all of which will be paid by kcp l 
management believes kcp l has adequate access to capital resources through cash flows from operations or through existing lines of credit to support the funding requirements 
effective january   the company amended the retirement programs for management employees other than wcnoc employees to allow current employees the option to remain in the existing program or to choose a new retirement program which will provide  among other things  an enhanced benefit under the employee savings plan k and a lower benefit accrual rate under the defined pension benefit plan 
employees hired after september   will be placed in the new retirement program 
credit ratings at december   the major credit rating agencies rated great plains energy s and kcp l s securities as detailed in the following table 
moody s standard investors service poor s great plains energy outlook stable credit watch negative corporate credit rating bbb preferred stock ba bb senior unsecured debt baa bbb kcp l outlook stable credit watch negative senior secured debt a bbb senior unsecured debt a bbb commercial paper p a the ratings presented reflect the current views of these rating agencies and are subject to change 
great plains energy and kcp l view maintenance of strong credit ratings as extremely important and to that end an active and ongoing dialogue is maintained with the agencies with respect to results of operations  financial position  and future prospects 
a decrease in these credit ratings would have an adverse impact on great plains energy s and kcp l s access to capital  its cost of funds  the amount of collateral required under power supply agreements and great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
on february   moody s investors service moody s announced that the outlook for both great plains energy and kcp l would be changed from stable to negative 
the negative outlook captures moody s concern that great plains energy s credit metrics and financial flexibility may be weakened more than anticipated following its acquisition of aquila based on the current regulatory proposal before the mpsc 
moody s also cited recent disclosure by great plains energy of potential cost pressures on kcp l s iatan no 
and iatan no 
projects  as well as recent weakness in certain key credit metrics at kcp l as contributing to the changed outlook 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
none of great plains energy s and kcp l s outstanding debt  except for the notes associated with affordable housing investments  requires the acceleration of interest and or principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade  unless the downgrade occurs in the context of a merger  consolidation or sale 
the anticipated acquisition of aquila will not be a merger  consolidation or sale that would trigger acceleration of interest and or principal payments 
in the event of a downgrade  great plains energy and kcp l and or their subsidiaries would be subject to increased interest costs on their credit facilities 
the interest rate on great plains energy s million of senior notes due  will increase if the notes are not rated investment grade 
additionally  in kcp l s bond insurance policies on its secured series eirr bonds totaling million  its series a and b eirr bonds totaling million  its secured and unsecured eirr bonds series totaling million and million  respectively  and its eirr bonds series a and b totaling million  kcp l has agreed to limits on its ability to issue additional mortgage bonds based on the mortgage bond s credit ratings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the interest rates on million of these eirr bonds are periodically reset through auction processes 
the bond insurance policies were issued by either xl capital assurance  inc  xlca or fgic 
both firms and the supported kcp l auction rate bonds were downgraded by at least two rating agencies in january and february concerns related to municipal bond insurers credit have adversely affected the ordinary course of operation of auctions for these types of bonds 
the interest rates set in recent auctions of kcp l s auction rate bonds have been adversely affected by these concerns  and the adverse effects are expected to continue until the bonds are changed to another interest rate mode 
management is pursuing alternatives to mitigate exposure from these downgrades 
strategic energy supplier concentration and credit strategic energy enters into forward physical contracts with multiple suppliers 
at december   strategic energy s five largest suppliers under forward supply contracts represented of the total future dollar committed purchases 
strategic energy s five largest suppliers  or their guarantors  are rated investment grade 
in the event of supplier non delivery or default  strategic energy s results of operations could be affected to the extent the cost of replacement power exceeded the combination of the contracted price with the supplier and the amount of collateral held by strategic energy to mitigate its credit risk with the supplier 
in addition to the collateral  if any  that the supplier provides  strategic energy s risk may be further mitigated by the obligation of the supplier to make a default payment equal to the shortfall and to pay liquidated damages in the event of a failure to deliver power 
there is no assurance that the supplier in such an instance would make the default payment and or pay liquidated damages 
strategic energy s results of operations and financial position could also be affected  in a given period  if it were required to make a payment upon termination of a supplier contract to the extent the contracted price with the supplier exceeded the market value of the contract at the time of termination 
the following tables provide information on strategic energy s credit exposure to suppliers  net of collateral  at december  number of net exposure of counterparties counterparties exposure greater than greater than before credit credit net of net of net rating collateral collateral exposure exposure exposure external rating millions millions investment grade non investment grade internal rating investment grade non investment grade total maturity of credit risk exposure before credit collateral less than total rating years years exposure external rating millions investment grade non investment grade internal rating investment grade non investment grade total external ratings are determined by using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if a counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity  the determination has been based on the rating of its guarantor 
internal ratings are determined by  among other things  an analysis of the counterparty s financial statements and consideration of publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty s parent 
investment grade counterparties are those with a minimum senior unsecured debt rating of bbb from standard poor s or baa from moody s investors service 
exposure before credit collateral has been calculated considering all netting agreements in place  netting accounts payable and receivable exposure with net mark to market exposure 
exposure before credit collateral  after consideration of all netting agreements  is impacted significantly by the power supply volume under contract with a given counterparty and the relationship between current market prices and contracted power supply prices 
credit collateral includes the amount of cash deposits and letters of credit received from counterparties 
net exposure has only been calculated for those counterparties to which strategic energy is exposed and excludes counterparties exposed to strategic energy 
at december   strategic energy had exposure before collateral to non investment grade counterparties totaling million 
in addition  strategic energy held collateral totaling million limiting its exposure to these non investment grade counterparties to million 
where available  strategic energy contracts with national and regional counterparties that have direct supplies and assets in the region of demand

strategic energy has entered into financial swaps in certain markets to limit the unfavorable effect that future price increases will have on future electricity purchases 
these financial swaps settle during the same period as power flows to the retail customer and could result in a cash obligation or a cash receipt 
due to the uncertainty of the future cash flows  these financial swaps have been omitted from the table above 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes on january  at december   the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l was million and million  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  great plains energy and consolidated kcp l face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal  operations and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis 
see item a 
risk factors and item 
md a for further discussion of risk factors 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects the volatility of the markets may have on its operating results 
during the normal course of business  under the direction and control of internal risk management committees  great plains energy s and kcp l s hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
though management believes its risk management practices to be effective  it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk 
great plains energy and kcp l could experience losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position  due to many factors  including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets  from regulatory driven market rule changes and or bankruptcy or non performance of customers or counterparties  and or failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 
derivative instruments are frequently utilized to execute risk management and hedging strategies 
derivative instruments  such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options  derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 
great plains energy and kcp l maintain commodity price risk management strategies that use derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated net income fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
interest rate risk great plains energy and consolidated kcp l manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may also be used to achieve the desired combination 
using outstanding balances and annualized interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with long term variable rate debt would result in an increase of million in interest expense for additionally  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
kcp l had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  the principal amount  which will vary during the year  of the commercial paper will drive kcp l s commercial paper interest expense 
assuming that million of commercial paper was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical increase in commercial paper rates would result in an increase of million in interest expense for a change in interest rates would impact the company to the extent it redeemed any of its outstanding long term debt 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s book values of long term debt approximated fair values at december  commodity risk kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l s wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and long  intermediate and short term capacity or power purchase agreements 
the agreements contain penalties for non performance to limit kcp l s energy price risk on the contracted energy 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase agreements with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to customers 
kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its power generating units 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l s sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system requirements and market prices at the time of the increases 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of power could result in a million decrease in operating income for related to purchased power 
in  approximately of kcp l s net mwhs generated are expected to be coal fired 
kcp l currently has almost all of its coal requirements for under contract 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could result in less than a million increase in fuel expense for kcp l has also implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices could result in an increase of million in fuel expense for at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments including forward physical energy purchases  to minimize significant  unanticipated net income fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
financial derivative instruments  including swaps  are used to limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases  effectively fixing the future purchase price of electricity for the applicable forecasted usage and protecting strategic energy from significant price volatility 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of purchased power could result in a million increase in purchased power expense for strategic energy has historically utilized certain derivative instruments to protect against significant price volatility for purchased power that have qualified for the npns exception  in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
however  as certain markets continue to develop  some derivative instruments may no longer qualify for the npns exception 
as such  strategic energy is designating these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  where appropriate  which could result in future increased volatility in derivative assets and liabilities  oci and net income above levels historically experienced 
derivative instruments that were designated as npns are accounted for by accrual accounting  which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the derivative contract settles 
accordingly  the increase in derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  and the corresponding decrease in derivatives accounted for as npns transactions  may affect the timing and nature of accounting recognition  but does not change the underlying economics of the transactions 
investment risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund its share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however  the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds at december  a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities at december  kcp l s exposure to investment risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates 
klt investments has affordable housing notes that require the greater of of the outstanding note balances or the next annual installment to be held as cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities 
a hypothetical decrease in market prices of the securities held as collateral would have an insignificant impact on pre tax net income for
