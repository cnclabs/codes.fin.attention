we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil development  exploitation and exploration  exclusively within the united states and canada 
overview cabot oil gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development  exploitation  exploration  production and marketing of natural gas  and to a lesser extent  crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america 
we also transport  store  gather and produce natural gas for resale 
our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
at cabot  there are three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities  financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and  to a lesser extent  acquisition opportunities 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 
at any one time  one or more of these may not be economically feasible 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout and  the futures market reported strong natural gas and crude oil contract prices 
our realized natural gas and crude oil price was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  in these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments 
in an effort to manage commodity price risk  we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars 
these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy and assisted in the increase in our realized natural gas price from to commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices  and therefore  we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
see risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item a

natural gas revenues increased from to as a result of an increase in realized prices  resulting from favorable natural gas hedge settlements  and increased natural gas production 
crude oil revenues decreased from to primarily due to decreased gulf coast production related primarily to the south louisiana and offshore properties sale 
prices  including the realized impact of derivative instruments  increased by one percent for natural gas and three percent for oil 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with a success rate of in total capital and exploration expenditures increased by million to million in compared to million in we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund a substantial portion of our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately million 
any additional needs will be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 
our strategy will remain consistent with we will remain focused on our strategy of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position 
additionally  we will continue to add to our acreage position in certain areas for future drilling opportunities 
in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions 
we believe that these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and that this activity will continue to add shareholder value over the long term

table of contents 
index to financial statements financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund development and  to a lesser extent  exploratory expenditures  and to pay dividends 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile  including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years 
in addition  fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
working capital is also substantially influenced by these variables discussed above 
from time to time  our working capital will reflect a surplus  while at other times it will reflect a deficit 
this fluctuation is not unusual 
we believe we have adequate liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for current income taxes from to primarily due to the payment of approximately million related to the south louisiana and offshore properties sale  as well as our tax net operating loss position and the receipt in of million in federal tax refunds relating to our tax return 
key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
average realized natural gas prices increased by one percent in over and average crude oil realized prices increased by three percent over the same period 
equivalent production decreased by three percent in compared to as a result of a decrease in crude oil production  offset in part by an increase in natural gas production 
we are unable to predict future commodity prices and  as a result  cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in decreased by million over this decrease was primarily due to an increase in current income tax expense  partially offset by an increase in earnings and an increase in working capital changes 
the increase in cash paid for income taxes from to is primarily due to the december payment of approximately million related to the south louisiana and offshore properties sale 
other factors impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
average realized natural gas prices increased six percent over  while crude oil realized prices increased over the same period 
equivalent production increased by five percent in compared to see results of operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 
investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses 
we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise  our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million from to and decreased by million from to the increase from to was due to a decrease of million in in proceeds from the sale of assets and an increase of million in in capital expenditures  partially offset by reduced exploration expenses of million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements cash flows used in investments in capital and exploration expenditures were million in compared to million used in  in response to higher commodity prices 
this increase of million in investments in capital and exploration expenses was entirely offset by the increase of million in proceeds from the sale of assets  primarily as a result of the south louisiana and offshore properties sale 
financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for  and contained a net increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by dividend payments 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for  and were comprised of payments made to decrease outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility  to purchase treasury stock and to pay dividends 
partially offsetting these cash uses were inflows from the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit received from stock based compensation 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for  resulting from borrowings under the credit facility  partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
the credit facility provides for an available credit line of million  which can be expanded up to million  either with the existing banks or new banks 
the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings  if necessary  our capital requirements  including potential acquisitions 
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may purchase shares of common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
there is no expiration date associated with the authorization 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during all purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions 
the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of december  was  see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information 
capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  dollars in millions debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million of current portion of long term debt at both december  and includes million and million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million on our common stock 
a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in after the march for stock split  the dividend was increased to per share per quarter  or a increase from pre split levels

index to financial statements increase in authorized shares on may   our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of shares of our common stock from million to million shares 
we correspondingly increased the number of shares of series a junior participating preferred stock reserved for issuance from  to  the shares of series a junior participating preferred stock are issuable pursuant to our rights agreement with the bank of new york  as rights agent 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  our revolving credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expense total we plan to drill approximately gross wells net in compared with gross wells net drilled in the number of wells we plan to drill in is down from primarily due to lower planned activity in the rocky mountains area based on lower natural gas prices and lower planned activity in canada based on uncertainty around royalties and exchange rates 
this drilling program includes approximately million in total capital and exploration expenditures  down from million in we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
there are many factors that impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate 
these include reserve additions and revisions  development costs  impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period 
in  management expects an increase in our dd a rate due to higher capital costs  partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years 
this change is currently estimated to be approximately five percent greater than levels 
this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 
contractual obligations our known material contractual obligations include long term debt  interest on long term debt  firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 
during  we assisted certain non executive employees in obtaining loans to purchase interests offered under our mineral  royalty and overriding royalty interest plan by providing a guarantee of repayment should the non executive employee fail to repay the loan 
the repayment term for all of these loans was five years 
the outstanding loan balances were approximately million in the aggregate as of december  and the fair value of these guarantees were immaterial to our financial statements 
there were no outstanding loan balances as of december  all loans were collateralized by the interests transferred to the employees in the producing properties

index to financial statements a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt interest on long term debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations including current portion 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt 
interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our million long term debt outstanding at december  interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december  outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through the maturity date and by assuming a constant interest rate of  which was the december  weighted average interest rate 
actual results will likely differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december  was million  up from million at december   primarily due to million of accretion expense during as well as million of drilling additions 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the most significant policies are discussed below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
since  of our reserves have been reviewed by miller lents  ltd  an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm  who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate 
we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years 
for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas information 
our rate of recording dd a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower 
table of contents 
index to financial statements market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dd a rate by approximately to per mcfe 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would have a to impact on our total dd a rate 
these estimated impacts are based on current data  and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd a rate 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
in  and  there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 
costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives 
average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year  the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively per year 
in the past  the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions 
average property lives in the east  gulf coast and west regions have been six  four and seven years  respectively 
average property lives in canada are estimated to be five years 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each quarterly period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective 
under sfas no 
 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges  and the change in fair value of all other derivatives  is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue  as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements long term employee benefit costs our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high quality fixed income securities 
in order to select the discount rate  we use benchmarks such as the moody s aa corporate rate  which was as of december   and the citigroup pension liability index  which was as of december  we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments 
we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of at december  is reasonable 
in order to value our pension liabilities  we use the rp combined mortality table 
this is a widely accepted table used for valuing pension liabilities 
this table represents a more recent and conservative mortality table than the group annuity mortality table  and appears to be an appropriate table based on the demographics of our benefit plans 
another consideration that is made is a salary scale selection 
we have assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan 
we attempt to maximize return over the long term  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors index over the long term 
we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the long term 
in our pension calculations  we have used eight percent as the expected long term return on plan assets for  and a monte carlo simulation was run using  simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration  which has been determined to be approximately years 
this model uses historical data for the period of for stocks  bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns 
the median rate of return  or return that we expect to achieve over percent of the time  is approximately nine percent 
we expect to achieve a minimum annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term at least percent of the time 
in addition  the actual rate of return on plan assets annualized over the past ten years is approximately six percent 
we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 
we generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities  fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately to for equity securities and approximately to for fixed income securities 
large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of of the portfolio 
small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of and  respectively  of the portfolio 
fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of of our portfolio

stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the accounting policies described in sfas no 
r  share based payment revised 
we chose to use the modified prospective method of transition  and accordingly  no adjustments to prior period financial statements were made 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we recognized compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in addition  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  outlines a fair value based method of accounting for stock options or similar equity instruments 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
to calculate the fair value  either a binomial or black scholes valuation model may be used 
one primary difference in our method of accounting after the adoption of sfas no 
r is that unvested stock options are now expensed as a component of stock based compensation cost in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
this expense is based on the fair value of the award at the original grant date and is recognized over the vesting period 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we included this amount as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the expense resulting from the expensing of stock options was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
another change relates to the accounting for our performance share awards 
certain of these awards are now accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components 
a monte carlo model is used to value the liability component  rather than accounting for the award using the average closing stock price at the end of each reporting period 
all other awards are accounted for in substantially the same way as they were or would have been in prior periods  with the exception of the differences noted below 
other differences in the way we account for stock based compensation after january   result from the application of a forfeiture rate to all grants rather than only recording actual forfeitures as they occur 
we are now required to estimate forfeitures on all equity based compensation and adjust periodic expense 
upon adoption  we did not report a cumulative effect adjustment for these forfeitures as the amount was immaterial 
in addition  this change in accounting for forfeitures resulted in an immaterial change in overall compensation cost for the years ended december  and furthermore  we are required to expense certain awards to retirement eligible employees in the month an employee becomes retirement eligible  depending on the structure of each individual plan 
the retirement eligibility provision only applies to new grants that were awarded after january  the total expense that we recognized related to restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights granted to retirement eligible employees in and was million in each year 
we issued stock appreciation rights to executive officers for the first time during the first quarter of the grant date fair value of these awards is measured using a black scholes model and compensation cost is expensed over the three year graded vesting service period 
expense related to these awards was million and million  before the effect of taxes  for and  respectively 
in addition  two new types of performance shares were issued to employees during and during  we issued to executive officers a new type of performance share award that vests depending on our operating income 
these awards vest based on a three year graded vesting service period  vesting one third on each anniversary date following the date of grant  provided that we have positive operating income 
if we do not have positive operating income for the year preceding a vesting date  then the portions of the award that would have vested on that date will be forfeited 
compensation cost related to these new operating income based performance 
table of contents 
index to financial statements share awards granted to employees was million  before the effect of taxes  for a second new type of performance share award  issued to non executive employees for the first time in and again in  measures our performance based on three internal metrics  rather than a peer group s stock performance which we use to measure certain other performance share awards 
these awards cliff vest at the end of the three year service period 
compensation cost related to these internal metric based performance share awards granted to employees was million and million  before the effect of taxes  for and  respectively 
total performance share expense related to all types of performance share awards  before the effect of taxes  was million for and million for a million million  net of tax cumulative effect charge incurred during the first quarter of is included in performance share expense within general and administrative expenses due to its immateriality  as a result of changes made in our accounting for performance shares 
for further information on the accounting for these and our other stock based compensation awards  please refer to notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions outlined under financial accounting standard board fasb staff position fsp fas no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  which discusses accounting for taxes for stock awards using the apic pool concept 
we made a one time election as prescribed under the fsp to use the shortcut approach to derive the initial windfall tax benefit pool 
we chose to use a one pool approach which combines all awards granted to employees  including non employee directors 
our compensation committee of our board of directors made one modification to our stock option awards in it approved the acceleration to december  of the vesting of  unvested stock options awarded in february under our second amended and restated long term incentive plan and  unvested stock options awarded in april under our incentive plan 
the  shares awarded to employees under the plan at an exercise price of would have vested in february the  shares awarded to non employee directors under the plan at an exercise price of would have vested  shares in each of april and april the decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options  which we believed to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees  was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative burden associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the accelerated vesting of the options did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for the acceleration of vesting reduced our compensation expense related to these options by approximately million for uncertain tax positions effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
this interpretation provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under fin  we now conduct a two step process for accounting for income tax uncertainties 
first  we perform an analysis to determine if a threshold condition of more likely than not is met to determine whether any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position should be recognized in the financial statements 
next  if the recognition threshold is met  we measure the amount of the uncertain tax position to be recognized based on additional guidance prescribed in fin under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
guidance is also provided regarding derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  interim period accounting  transition and increased disclosure of these uncertain tax position

other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum 
table of contents 
index to financial statements tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions for corporations other than integrated oil companies 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference cannot reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production  natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation  federal regulation of petroleum and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   we are in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks 
see risk factors we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item a 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in our not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest previously commonly referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary is an ownership 
table of contents 
index to financial statements interest in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the presentation of the consolidated income statement has been changed by sfas no 
 and consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest is now required to be reported separately 
previously  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest was typically reported as an expense or other deduction in arriving at consolidated net income and was often combined with other financial statement amounts 
in addition  the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent must be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the equity in the consolidated financial statements separately from the parent s equity 
subsequent changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for consistently  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity interest in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value 
expanded disclosures  including a reconciliation of equity balances of the parent and noncontrolling interest are also required 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and earlier adoption is prohibited 
prospective application is required 
at this time  we do not have any material noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
therefore  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r was issued in an effort to continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures 
it changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
certain of these changes will introduce more volatility into earnings 
the acquirer must now record all assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value  and related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than the previous method of being capitalized as part of the acquisition 
sfas no 
r also impacts the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions  including those that close before the effective date of sfas no 
r 
the definitions of a business and a business combination have been expanded  resulting in more transactions qualifying as business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and earlier adoption is prohibited 
we cannot predict the impact that the adoption of sfas no

fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
 to amend fin  offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts 
the terms conditional contracts and exchange contracts used in fin have been replaced with the more general term derivative contracts 
in addition  fsp no 
fin permits the offsetting of recognized fair values for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against fair values of derivatives under certain circumstances  such as under master netting arrangements 
additional disclosure is also required regarding a company s accounting policy with respect to offsetting fair value amounts 
the guidance in fsp no 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early application allowed 
the effects of initial adoption should be recognized as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application for all periods presented 
we do not believe that the adoption of fsp no 
fin will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents 
index to financial statements specified dates  to measure certain eligible financial instruments at fair value 
the objective of this statement is to reduce volatility in preparer reporting that may be caused as a result of measuring related financial assets and liabilities differently and to expand the use of fair value measurements 
the provisions of the statement apply only to entities that elect to use the fair value option and to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
additional disclosures are also required for instruments for which the fair value option is elected 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  no retrospective application is allowed  except for companies that choose to adopt early 
at the effective date  companies may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date  and the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value must be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
since we have not elected to adopt the fair value option for eligible items  we do not believe that sfas no 
will have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments and hedging activity our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
please read the discussion below as well as note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
under our revolving credit agreement  the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges 
at december   we had cash flow hedges open natural gas price collar arrangements  three natural gas swap arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement 
at december   a million million  net of tax unrealized gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  along with a million short term derivative receivable and a million short term derivative liability 
the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income

for  a million gain was recorded as a component of revenue  which reflected the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in the fair value of all other derivatives 
assuming no change in commodity prices  after december  we would expect to reclassify to the consolidated statement of operations  over the next months  million in after tax income associated with commodity hedges 
this reclassification represents the net short term receivable associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december  related to anticipated production 
hedges on production swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures
