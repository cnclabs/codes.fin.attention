results for the year ended december  included total revenue of  million  net income of million and diluted net income per share of 
these results reflect an increase in revenue primarily attributable to the continued growth in tysabri revenue  an increase in rituxan revenues from our unconsolidated joint business arrangement as well as the impact of price increases on our avonex product 
the effect of the increase in revenue was partially offset by an increase in research and development expense due to new and existing clinical trials and other projects and an increase in selling  general and administrative expense related to increased personnel to support ongoing tysabri and avonex sales 
in january  we received notice from icahn partners lp and certain of its affiliates for the nomination of three individuals to our board of directors at the company s annual meeting 
the notice also includes a proposal to amend the our bylaws to set the size of the board at our board of directors will review the notice and consider it in light of the best interests of all shareholders of the company 

table of contents in october  we announced that our board of directors had authorized management to evaluate whether third parties would have an interest in acquiring us at a price and on terms that would represent a better value for our stockholders than having us continue to execute our strategy on a stand alone basis 
in december  we announced that the board of directors had completed this evaluation  it resulted in no definitive offers to acquire the company and we will continue as an independent company 
in november  we entered into an agreement with neurimmune subone ag  or neurimmune  for the worldwide development and commercialization of human antibodies for the treatment of alzheimer s disease ad 
neurimmune will conduct research to identify potential therapeutic antibodies and we will be responsible for the development and commercialization of all products

under the terms of the agreement  we paid a million upfront fee and could pay up to an additional million if certain milestones are met 
in july  we completed a tender offer in which we purchased  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of  million 
we funded the transaction in july through existing cash and cash equivalents of  million and by obtaining a short term loan for  million 
we retired all of these shares in july in january  we completed the acquisition of of the stock of syntonix pharmaceuticals  inc for total initial consideration of million and contingent payments of up to million  if certain milestones are achieved 
marketed products we currently have four products avonex interferon beta a  rituxan rituximab  tysabri natalizumab  fumaderm dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts in december  we sold the us marketing  sales  and manufacturing and development right of zevalin to cell therapeutics  inc  or cti  for an upfront purchase price of million and up to an additional million in milestone payments 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments on future sales of zevalin 
as part of the overall agreement  we entered into a supply agreement with cti to sell zevalin product through and a related services and security agreement under which cti has agreed to reimburse us for costs incurred in an ongoing randomized clinical trial for zevalin with respect to aggressive non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
the million upfront payment will be recognized in our results of operations over the term of the supply agreement 
through april  we recorded product revenues from sales of amevive alefacept 
in april  we sold the worldwide rights to this product to astellas pharma us  inc  or astellas 
we will continue to manufacture and supply this product to astellas for a period of up to years 
under the terms of the supply agreement  we charge astellas fixed amounts based on volume 
such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not expected to be significant 
most of our revenues are currently dependent on avonex  tysabri  and rituxan 
in the near term  we are dependent on the continued sales growth of tysabri to grow our overall revenues 
in the longer term  our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of current pipeline products and other in licensed or acquired products and programs 

table of contents continued growth of global avonex sales is primarily dependent on maintaining avonex s position as the most prescribed multiple sclerosis  or ms  therapy in the us and growing avonex market share outside the us in both the us and globally  we face increasing competition in the ms market from currently marketed products and future products in late stage development 
we continue to generate data showing avonex to be an effective and safe choice for ms patients and physicians 
the majority of rituxan sales are currently from use in the oncology setting 
we believe there is additional room for rituxan sales growth in the immunology setting  where rituxan is currently indicated for patients with rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  with inadequate response to anti tumor necrosis factor therapies  or tnf ir ra patients 
additional immunology indications for rituxan that we are investigating include earlier stage ra patients with inadequate response to disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs  or dmard ir patients  ms and lupus 
in july  we began to ship tysabri in the us in connection with the re introduction and internationally for the first time 
tysabri sales are currently for use in the relapsing remitting ms setting 
growth in tysabri revenue will be dependent on the generation of a larger and longer term safety database as well as continued acceptance by physicians and ms patients 
in january  the fda approved tysabri as a treatment of certain patients with crohn s disease 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
for  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
we have a number of pipeline products in late stage clinical trials  including over pipeline products in phase or phase trials 
pipeline products for which we have entered or initiated phase trials include bg for relapsing forms of ms  galiximab for nhl  and rituxan for a number of indications  including chronic lymphocytic leukemia  ra  primary progressive ms and lupus nephritis 
in addition to the expense associated with these late stage trials  other pipeline products are in ongoing or are expected to enter proof of concept trials in business development as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and develop such products and or technologies  and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we may experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results  primarily based on the level and timing of product revenues  cost of product sales  collaboration revenues  cost of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and product approvals  marketing and other expenses  
table of contents manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 
we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  as well as potential repayment of short term debt 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of future revenue growth  such as the degree of market acceptance  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates

avonex revenues from avonex were as follows in millions year ended december  avonex us rest of world total avonex revenues for compared to  us sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of price increases offset by decreased product demand resulting in lower volume 
for compared to and international sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of exchange rates and higher sales volume 
for compared to  us sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of price increases and a reduction in discounts associated with the introduction of the medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
these increases were offset by lower volume 
for compared to  international sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to increases in volume and price  including the impact of patient mix 
foreign exchange accounted for a increase in reported revenues  on a local currency basis  international sales increased 
we expect to face increasing competition in the ms marketplace in and outside the us from existing and new ms treatments  including tysabri  which may impact sales of avonex 
we expect future sales of avonex to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products of our competitors 
tysabri revenues from tysabri were as follows in millions year ended december  tysabri us rest of world total tysabri revenues 
table of contents under the terms of a collaboration agreement with elan corporation plc  or elan  we manufacture tysabri and collaborate with elan on the product s marketing  commercial distribution and on going development activities 
we recognize revenue for sales of tysabri in the us upon elan s shipment of the product to third party distributors 
we recognize revenue for sales of tysabri outside the us at the time of product delivery to our customers 
in november  tysabri was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  as a treatment for relapsing forms of ms to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
in  our net revenue associated with sales of tysabri was million  which consisted of revenue of million from sales that occurred prior to our voluntary suspension  offset by an allowance for sales returns of million related to returns of product sold prior to the suspension 
on june   the fda approved a supplemental biologics license application  or sbla  for the reintroduction of tysabri as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of ms to slow the progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
on june   we and elan announced that the european medicines agency  or emea  had approved tysabri as a similar treatment 
in july  we began to ship tysabri in both the united states and europe 
in  we recorded revenue on sales of tysabri in the us and europe relating to activity of million and million  respectively 
prior to the suspension of tysabri in  we shipped product to elan in the us and recognized revenue in accordance with the policy described above 
as a result of the suspension of tysabri  we had deferred million in revenue related to tysabri product that remained in elan s ending inventory 
this amount was paid by elan during and was subsequently recognized as revenue during  when the uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was eliminated 
in  we have recorded revenue on sales of tysabri in the us and europe of million and million  respectively 
the increase in sales over sales is primarily due to an increase in the number of patients using tysabri and increased volumes  as the product was being shipped for the entire months during during and  we had product on hand that had been fully written off in due to the uncertainties surrounding the tysabri suspension but which is available to fill future orders 
as we sold tysabri in and  we realized lower than normal cost of sales and  therefore  higher margins  as we shipped the inventory that had been previously written off 
for and  cost of sales was approximately million and million  respectively  lower due to the sale of tysabri that had been previously written off 
all tysabri inventory that had been previously written off had been shipped as of december  fumaderm fumaderm was produced by fumapharm  which we acquired in june in december  we acquired the right to distribute fumaderm in germany from fumedica  beginning on may  in connection with the acquisition of the fumaderm distribution rights in germany  we committed to the repurchase of any inventory fumedica had not sold by may  as a result of this provision  we deferred the recognition of revenue on shipments made to fumedica through april  we resumed recognizing revenue on sales of fumaderm into the german market in may sales of fumaderm for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in sales over sales is primarily due to increased volumes 
zevalin in  and sales of zevalin were million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million  and million respectively  were generated in the us the decrease in total zevalin sales in compared to was primarily due to the reduction in sales and marketing efforts in as we prepared for the sale of our rights to market  sell  manufacture and develop zevalin in the us  which was completed in december

provisions for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically upon delivery 
revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veteran s administration  or va  rebates  managed care rebates  product returns  other applicable allowances and  in and  patient assistance and patient replacement goods 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent significant judgments 
effective january   we changed the manner in which we administer our patient assistance and patient replacement goods programs 
prior to january   avonex product shipped for these programs was invoiced and recorded as gross product revenue and an offsetting provision for discount and returns was recorded for expected credit requests from the distributor that administers these programs on our behalf 
effective january   we entered into a new arrangement with a distributor  which established a consignment sales model 
under the new sales model  gross revenue is not recorded for product shipped to satisfy these programs  and cost of sales is recorded when the product is shipped

these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
product revenue reserves are categorized as follows discounts  contractual adjustments and returns 
discount reserves include trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives and  in and  patient assistance 
for compared to  discounts decreased million  or  resulting from a million reduction related to the change of patient assistance to a consignment model  offset by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives

contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid  va and managed care rebates and other applicable allowances 
for compared to  contractual adjustments increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates and medicaid and va programs associated with price increases 
for compared to  contractual adjustments were consistent reflecting more activity in the managed care markets  offset by a reduction in medicaid activity due to the introduction of medicare part d  the expanded prescription drug benefit program 
product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and our patient replacement goods program in and in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
we also accept returns from our patients for various reasons

the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product 
unconsolidated joint business revenues we copromote rituxan in the us in collaboration with genentech  inc  or genentech  under a collaboration agreement between the parties 
under the collaboration agreement  we granted genentech a worldwide license to develop  commercialize and market rituxan in multiple indications 
in exchange for these worldwide rights  we have copromotion rights in the us and a contractual arrangement under which genentech shares a portion of the pretax us copromotion profits of rituxan with us 
this collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
in june  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti cd antibodies targeting b cell disorders  in addition to rituxan  for a broad range of indications

the increase in from was primarily due to the approval by the fda of rituxan for two new indications  ra and diffuse large b cell lymphoma and an increase in wholesale prices 
for compared to  reimbursements of selling and development expenses decreased million  or 
for compared to  such reimbursements increased million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the expansion of the oncology sales force and development costs we incurred related to the development of rituxan for ra

table of contents royalty revenues we receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control 
our royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us are included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

for compared to  royalty revenue decreased million  or  primarily due to a decrease in sales levels of products under license and to the expiration of certain contracts 
we anticipate that total royalty revenues in future years will continue to represent a lower proportion of our total revenues 
royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs 
corporate partner revenues corporate partner revenues represent contract revenues and license fees

if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due to expiration 
in all cases product inventory was written down to its estimated net realizable value 
we closely monitor levels of inventory in our distribution channel 
at both december  and  we had approximately weeks of inventory with wholesalers in our distribution channel 
the shelf life associated with our products is generally between and months  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to dating 
table of contents expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
we have written down the following inventory  which was charged to cost of sales in millions year ended december  avonex tysabri fumaderm amevive zevalin the write downs were the result of the following in millions year ended december  new components for alternative presentations failed quality specifications excess and or obsolescence costs for voluntary suspension of tysabri research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in for compared to  research and development expenses increased million  or  primarily due to approximately million of expense for the development of lixivaptan  including a million upfront payment to cardiokine biopharma llc  a million increase for adentri projects  a million increase for lumiliximab projects  a million increase for bg projects  a million increase for hspi projects  a million increase for igf r projects  a million increase for baminercept alfa ltbr fc projects and million of research and development costs related to syntonix projects 
for compared to  research and development expenses decreased million  or  primarily due to a million reduction in salary and benefits arising from headcount reductions in  a million decrease related to the nimo facility that was sold in the second quarter of  and a million decrease for clinical trials  primarily related to tysabri and amevive 
these decreases were offset by a million increase for new collaborations during the year  a million increase for higher clinical manufacturing  and the million impact of share based compensation recognized under statement of financial accounting standards revised no

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in 
table of contents for compared to  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  primarily due to a million increase in sales and marketing activities for tysabri  primarily in international sales and marketing  a million net increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel  a million increase in fees and services related to general and administrative matters offset by a million decrease in sales and marketing activities for zevalin due to decreased commercial efforts due to the planned divestiture of this product line

we anticipate that total selling  general  and administrative expenses in will be higher than due to sales  marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support avonex and tysabri  especially in the international market 
severance and other restructuring costs severance and other restructuring costs totaled million in as compared to million in and million in these costs are included in selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income

the charges related to this retirement amounted to million and were all paid in we may have additional charges in future periods 
the amount of those future charges cannot be determined at this time 
amortization of intangible assets for   and  amortization expense was million  million and million  respectively 
our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
our amortization policy for our core technology intangible asset is based on the principles of statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which requires the amortization of intangible assets to 
table of contents reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
every year during the third quarter we complete our long range planning cycle  which includes an analysis of the anticipated product sales of avonex 
the results of this forecast serve as the basis for our assumptions used in the economic consumption amortization model for our core technology intangible asset 
we also establish minimum annual amortization amounts to ensure amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods 
see note  business overview and significant accounting policies  for a detailed description of our accounting policy for amortization of intangible assets 
for compared to  amortization expense decreased million  or  primarily due to the changes in estimate of the future revenue of avonex  which serves as the basis in our calculation of economic consumption for core technology

in process research and development ipr d ipr d charges totaled million in  compared with million in no ipr d charges were taken in during the year ended december   we recorded ipr d charges of million 
the principal components of this amount are as follows million related to the acquisition of syntonix  approximately million related to the collaboration with cardiokine biopharma llc  and million related to the collaboration with neurimmune 
in  we recorded million and million in ipr d related to the acquisitions of fumapharm ag  or fumapharm  and conforma  respectively 
see note  acquisitions and dispositions  and note  research collaborations of the consolidated financial statements 
cardiokine biopharma llc and neurimmune are variable interest entities  as defined in fin r 
the consolidation of these entities resulted in ipr d charges 
the ipr d charges have been recorded as a component of operating income 
however  because the ipr d charges relate to the fair value of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of cardiokine biopharma llc and neurimmune  these amounts were allocated to the respective minority interests 
consequently  minority interest of million was recorded as a component of non operating income

in  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of nico to its net realizable value 
no additional loss resulted from completion of the sale 
in june  we sold our large scale biologics manufacturing facility in oceanside  california  known as nimo  along with approximately acres of real property located in oceanside  california upon which nimo is 
table of contents located  together with improvements  related property rights  and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real property 
total consideration for the sale was million 
the loss from this transaction was million which consisted primarily of the write down of nimo to net selling price  sales and transfer taxes  and other associated transaction costs 
after our voluntary suspension of tysabri  we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in hiller d  denmark  but determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of the facility 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in related to the fill finish component that had previously been capitalized 
gain on settlement of license agreements  net in  we recorded a net gain on settlement of license agreements  net of million 
fumapharm during  we recorded a gain of million coincident with the acquisition of fumapharm in accordance with eitf  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination  or eitf the gain related to the settlement of a preexisting collaboration agreement between fumapharm and us 
the collaboration agreement was entered into in october and required payments to fumapharm of certain royalty amounts 
the market rate for such payments was higher at the acquisition date  primarily due to the increased technical feasibility of bg the gain relates to the difference between the royalty rates at the time the agreement was entered into as compared to the rates at the time the agreement was effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of fumapharm 
fumedica during  we recorded a charge of million in connection with a settlement agreement with fumedica arzneimittel ag and fumedica arzneimittel gmbh  collectively fumedica 
the charge related to the settlement of the agreement with fumedica under which we were contingently obligated to make royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of bg for psoriasis in germany 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we will not be required to make any royalty payments to fumedica if bg is successfully launched for psoriasis in germany 
the million was expensed in  as it related to a product that has not reached technological feasibility 
share based compensation expense in the year ended december   we recorded share based compensation expense of million associated with sfas r 
in the year ended december   we recorded share based compensation expense of million associated with sfas r  which is net of a cumulative effect pre tax adjustment of million  or million after tax 
the cumulative effect results from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for current and prior period unvested restricted stock awards 
our share based compensation programs consist of share based awards granted to employees including stock options  restricted stock  performance share units and restricted stock units  or rsus  as well as our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
effective january   we adopted sfas r 
this statement requires compensation cost relating to share based awards to be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value measurement method 
under the fair value method  the estimated fair value of awards is charged against income over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we selected the modified prospective method as prescribed in sfas r and  therefore  prior periods were not restated 
under the modified prospective method  this statement was applied to awards granted subsequent to january   as well as to the unvested portion of previously granted equity based awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of december  the fair value of performance based stock units is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved 
compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the outcome of performance related conditions until the vesting date

because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
we expect to make approximately million of milestone payments in at december   we have several clinical studies in various clinical trial stages 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations  or cros 
the contracts with cros are generally cancellable at our option 
we have recorded accrued expenses of million recorded in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet for work done by cros at december  we have approximately million in cancellable future commitments based on existing cro contracts at december  we do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements

at december   we have approximately million of long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
legal matters see note  litigation  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of legal matters as of december  critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its critical estimates and judgments  including  among others  those related to revenue recognition  investments  inventory  research and development expenses  purchase accounting  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
those critical estimates and assumptions are based on 
table of contents our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable product revenues we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  va rebates  managed care rebates  product returns and other applicable allowances 
our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
these estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition 
royalties we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees 
investments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes and government securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested  equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements  and equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available 
these investments are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or sfas  or apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common  or apb  as appropriate 
in accounting for investments  we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary  and if so  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 
the factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  prospects for the investee  including favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives  new 
table of contents collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to recovery 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our results 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements a replacement of fasb concepts no 
 or fasb concepts statement no 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs will be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in costs of goods sold are write downs of commercial inventory that do not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to expiration 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 

table of contents valuation of acquired intangible assets and in process research and development expenses we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  an independent third party valuation firm is generally engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets as acquired 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
fin r under fin r  we consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  we consider a number of factors  including determining the expected losses and residual returns of the technologies being developed pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of such collaborations 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these analyses and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to assuming that the research and development efforts will result in an approved commercial product  estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting timing of regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding from partners resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
for such consolidated entities that we own less than a interest  we record minority interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the outside equity interests 
fin r impacts the way we account for certain collaborations and future events may result in our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we have a collaborative arrangement 
the consolidation of variable interest entities may have a material effect on our financial condition and or results of operation in future periods 
goodwill we annually assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
to do this  in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
calculating fair value involves identifying future cash flows  which requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 

table of contents share based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
in connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of viable tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
adoption of fasb interpretation no 
effective january   we adopted fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a reduction in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  which was recorded as a million reduction to the january  balance of our accumulated deficit  a million reduction in goodwill and a million increase in our deferred tax liability 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in millions balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current period additions for tax positions of prior periods reductions for tax positions of prior periods settlements balance at december  included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december  and january   are million and million net of the federal benefit on state issues  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods

table of contents disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting controls and procedures we have carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a e and d e under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the securities exchange act  as of december  based upon that evaluation  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that  as of the end of that period  our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that a the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and b such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures  our management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
changes in internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports 
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december  that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting 
management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act as a process designed by  or under the supervision of  a company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company s board of directors  management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based on our assessment  our management has concluded that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

table of contents the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  as stated in their report  which is included herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations in europe  japan  australia and canada in connection with the sale of avonex and tysabri 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through genentech on sales of rituxan outside of the us as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily euro  danish krone  swedish krona  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions 
certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
a basis point adverse movement increase in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the returns from cash and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change 
a basis point adverse movement decrease in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
we regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million
