item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected historical consolidated financial and operating data  and our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
restatement of financial statements geoeye  inc the company is restating herein its historical financial data for the three and nine month periods ended september  the company has preliminarily determined that its prior conclusions regarding an ownership change in control as provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as well as similar state provisions were incorrect and that a change in control may have occurred in since we currently believe that a change may have occurred in then as this change of control occurred within two years of the company s emergence from chapter  utilization of the company s pre reorganization nol carryforwards are eliminated 
the company has utilized its post reorganization carryforwards against taxable income generated in and through the third quarter of in the third quarter of the taxable income exceeded the post acquisition losses and therefore the company has restated its third quarter tax provision and has recorded an additional provision for income taxes of million 
the company will have a payment obligation if its final determination is that a change of control took place in the company is vigorously pursuing the matter 
if the company is able to conclude that a change of control for section purposes did not take place  the company plans to reinstate its pre reorganization nol carryforwards and apply them against taxable income in and as well as future periods to reduce any taxes payable 
if the pre reorganization nols are available  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  reductions in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance that existed at the date of fresh start accounting are first credited against an asset established for reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets  then to other identifiable intangible assets existing at the date of fresh start accounting and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited directly to additional paid in capital 
once these pre reorganization nols are utilized  the company would utilize its post reorganization nols to offset any future income tax expense 
for a discussion of the significant restatement adjustments and the background leading to the adjustments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
all amounts in this annual report on form k affected by the restatement adjustments reflect such amounts as restated 
overview geoeye  inc  a delaware corporation geoeye or the company  together with its consolidated subsidiaries  provides geospatial information  imagery and solutions for the national security community  strategic partners  resellers and commercial customers to help them better map  measure and monitor the world 
we operate a constellation of earth imaging satellites and mapping aircraft which collect process and distribute digital imagery of the earth s surface  atmosphere and weather conditions and have an international network of ground stations  a robust imagery archive  and advanced geospatial imagery processing capabilities 
we acquired the ikonos satellite in january upon our purchase of the operating assets of space imaging llc space imaging and we have a license to operate and control the orbview satellite 
we acquired the mapping aircraft in march upon our purchase of mj harden associates  inc mj harden 
we also are constructing a next generation high resolution imagery satellite  which we have designated geoeye the launch of geoeye is planned to occur during from vandenberg air force base  california 
our satellite system also includes a us ground system necessary to operate the satellites and to collect  process and distribute imagery from the satellites 
in addition  we maintain image processing and production centers at our headquarters in dulles  virginia and our facilities in thornton  colorado and mission  kansas  as well as an advanced image processing and geospatial information technology development and production center in st 
louis  missouri 
our principal sources of revenue are the sale of satellite imagery to customers  regional distributors and value added resellers  and the processing and production of imagery and geospatial information 
we have entered into several long term sales contracts to provide imagery products  and in certain circumstances we will be entitled to receive contractual payments in advance of product delivery 
our direct expenses include the costs of operating the satellites  airplanes and ground systems  as well as costs to perform value added processing services and construction costs related to distributor owned ground stations 
labor expenses and depreciation represent the largest component of our direct expenses 
prior to the acquisition of the space imaging operating assets in  we had incurred losses from operations since our inception 
our net earnings were million in and million in management currently projects that the combined company will continue to generate earnings from operations in nextview program 
the us government  through the national geospatial intelligence agency nga  announced in that it intended to support the continued development of the commercial satellite imagery industry through contracts to support the engineering  construction and launch of the next generation of imagery satellites by two providers 
this program is known as nextview 
on september   nga awarded the company a contract as the second provider under the nextview program 
as the winning bidder  we are  as prime contractor  constructing a new satellite  geoeye we estimate the total project cost including financing and launch insurance costs to bring the geoeye satellite into service will be approximately million 
we have spent approximately million under the program through december  remaining expenditures under the program principally consist of milestone payments to our subcontractors  launch and on orbit insurance premiums and capitalized interest 
nga is supporting the project with a cost share totaling approximately million spread out over the course of the project and subject to various milestones 
through december   we have earned million of milestone payments from nga  which includes the receipt of million in january for milestones completed in as of september   we secured million of launch and first year on orbit insurance and million of launch plus three year on orbit insurance for the satellite 
proceeds from this insurance would be paid in the event of a launch failure or if on orbit anomalies prevent the satellite from being placed into service 
most of these premiums will be paid within days of the launch of geoeye depending on market and economic conditions  we may attempt to procure additional insurance on geoeye we continue to make progress toward launch of the geoeye satellite 
in october  boeing indicated that  given their other launch commitments  our target launch date was april  from vandenberg air force base  california 
however  on january  we received a letter from the contract administrator of boeing launch services  inc  indicating that boeing and its affiliate  united launch alliance  llc do not expect to launch the geoeye satellite on the date specified in the launch services agreement between geoeye and boeing  set for a day launch window commencing april  boeing has offered in its letter to launch geoeye on august  from vandenberg air force base 
we have informed boeing that we expect them to prepare to launch us as soon as possible 
shifts in launch dates frequently occur  and we continue to work toward the earliest possible launch date 
we believe that when it is launched and placed into service  geoeye will be the most modern  high capacity  high resolution commercial imaging satellite in the world 
geoeye is designed for meter resolution panchromatic black and white images  and meter resolution multi spectral color images  with the capability to take panchromatic images across up to  square kilometers of the earth s surface every day at meter resolution or better  or over million square kilometers per year  or multi spectral images across up to  square kilometers of the earth s surface every day at meter resolution or better  or over million square kilometers per year 
the nextview contract also provides for nga to order approximately million of imagery products beginning february  and continuing until six quarters after geoeye goes into service 
in february  the company and nga executed the initial task order under the nextview contract whereby nga agreed to purchase million of imagery products from the company s existing satellites for the period from february  to december  all of the imagery under this task order was delivered to nga by september  in november  we completed discussions with nga for a new million task order for the continued delivery of products from november to the launch of geoeye as of february  million has been funded by nga under this task order 
we delivered approximately million of imagery under this task order in the fourth quarter of once the geoeye satellite is placed into service  nga will have the first right to order images from the satellite  which would utilize approximately half of the satellite s imagery taking capacity  with the remainder available for commercial and state and foreign government sales by the company 
geoeye is intended to have a design life of seven years and sufficient fuel to operate for up to two additional years 
based on nga s public announcement of expected ongoing support  we expect nga to continue to purchase our imagery products following expiration of the nextview contract 
geoeye satellite 
in october  we announced that we had entered into a contract with itt corporation to begin work on the camera for our next earth imaging satellite to be named geoeye this is the first step in a phased development process for an advanced  third generation satellite 
geoeye will be of the same general class as geoeye  but will benefit from some improvements in capability 
we expect to contract with a satellite builder in and launch the satellite approximately three to four years after work begins on that contract 
we will evaluate our options for financing the construction of geoeye in conjunction with its selection of the satellite builder 
business combinations and investments 
on september   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement to acquire the operating assets of space imaging for approximately million less amounts to be paid by space imaging on its existing debt prior to closing as well as certain other adjustments  which collectively totaled approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  the company entered into an assignment of rights and obligations  dated as of january   with orbimage si opco inc opco  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the company  whereby the company agreed to assign all of its rights and certain obligations in  to and under the purchase agreement to opco 
we made a million initial payment to the sellers in september and completed the acquisition on january  by paying the sellers the remaining million 
we incurred approximately million of acquisition related out of pocket expenditures 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired space imaging s cash balance at closing  which totaled approximately million 
the cash purchase price was principally funded with the issuance of million of indebtedness 
we made quarterly payments totaling million during and repaid the remaining principal of million on february  our financial statements reflect the operations of opco from january  the assets acquired from space imaging generated most of our revenues and net earnings in and on march   we acquired mj harden associates  inc through a stock purchase of all of the outstanding stock of mj harden s sole owner  i  inc mj harden is a provider of digital aerial imagery and geospatial information solutions 
with the acquisition we now have access to mj harden s digital aerial imagery capture capability  photogrammetry services  mobile and geographic information system technology and implementation services  field data collection and other related services that provide customers with asset mapping and corridor management solutions 
customers include utilities  engineering companies  developers and federal  state and local government agencies  among others 
mj harden is located in mission  kansas  and has approximately employees 
our financial statements reflect the operations of mj harden from march  on june   we purchased a percent of the outstanding voting shares in spadac  inc spadac  a privately held entity  for million 
spadac delivers innovative comprehensive geointelligence and predictive analysis solutions  including applied research and development  to customers primarily in defense  intelligence and homeland security agencies 
on august   we purchased a percent ownership position in east dawn group  inc east dawn  a privately held corporation  for million 
east dawn was established to provide satellite imagery and value added products in china and to provide production services to international customers 
east dawn  in turn  formed a new company  beijing earth observation beo  to implement this strategy 
beo will be geoeye s exclusive master reseller in china for ikonos imagery products in china  including the ikonos archive 
as part of the transaction  four of our employees are members of beo s board of directors  which is comprised of ten members 
organization structure 
the company was organized on april  to enable its predecessor registrant and now its wholly owned subsidiary  orbimage inc  a delaware corporation  to implement a holding company organizational structure 
effective june   the company reorganized into a holding company structure  effected by a merger conducted pursuant to section g of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the merger 
prior to the merger  the company was a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of orbimage inc pursuant to the merger  each issued and outstanding share of common stock of orbimage inc was converted into one share of common stock of the company and all of the issued and outstanding shares of the company owned by orbimage inc were automatically canceled and retired 
as a result of the merger  each stockholder of orbimage inc became a holder of the common stock of the company  evidencing the same proportional interests  and orbimage inc became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
accordingly  the company became the successor registrant of orbimage inc for sec reporting purposes 
in connection with the merger  the company assumed orbimage inc s obligations under its stock incentive plans and warrant agreements 
outstanding options and warrants to purchase orbimage inc s common stock were automatically converted into options and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares at the same exercise price of the company s common stock 
the company also assumed orbimage inc s registration obligations under two registration rights agreements 
the conversion of shares of capital stock in the merger occurred without an exchange of certificates 
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation  including  without limitation  those relating to the authorized capital stock and the bylaws of the company  are identical to those of orbimage inc prior to the merger 
the other liabilities of orbimage inc  including contingent liabilities  were not assumed by the company in the transaction and therefore continue to be obligations of orbimage inc  and the assets of orbimage inc 
were not transferred to the company and continue to be the assets of orbimage inc upon closing of the space imaging acquisition  we adopted the brand name geoeye 
on september   our stockholders voted to formally change the legal name of the company to geoeye  inc industry and business considerations nga s requirements for defense and related products and services for and beyond will continue to be affected by global concerns about terrorism and nuclear proliferation  the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan and increased concerns about natural disasters 
the attacks focused greater attention on the security of our country from terrorists  and hurricane katrina focused greater attention on the security of our country from natural phenomena 
the president s budget proposal for fiscal year and beyond presents a framework to reduce the federal budget deficit while continuing to gather intelligence that may help reduce global terrorism and nuclear proliferation 
we believe the government s commercial imagery requirements will continue to grow in the short term and that funding will continue to be at a steady state  subject to congressional appropriations 
we believe that the upcoming presidential election will not significantly impact allocation of funds to the purchase of commercial imagery given the government s desire to monitor global events 
the budget for other non defense federal agencies is anticipated to decline through these changes in the president s budget plan reflect a commitment to reduce the federal budget deficit and the sentiment that sustained federal deficits could hamper economic growth 
we also provide products and services to a number of government agencies other than nga  including nasa and the us geological survey 
although our products and services which address civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets  they share many of the same risks  as well as other risks unique to the particular programs 
other risks unique to civil government programs may include development of competing products  technological feasibility and product obsolescence 
in  the nga and national reconnaissance office commissioned a panel to prepare an independent study of the roles of commercial remote sensing in the future national system for geospatial intelligence 
the study was undertaken in response to congressional concerns that the us intelligence community is not taking full advantage of commercial satellite capabilities 
the report said the government must not become dependent on external sources for the provision of critical satellite intelligence data  and must not become dependent on non government sources for the provision of satellite intelligence data that is more critical than that which is now provided or will be provided under the nextview contract 
the panel s favored alternatives are a return to the traditional model in which the government uses its own satellites to meet its image gathering needs and a hybrid option whereby commercial data providers would be given the opportunity to partake in government block satellite buys 
under the latter scenario  the government would procure low to medium resolution imaging satellites in blocks of at least four 
commercial data providers such as geoeye would then be given access to two of the satellites to sell data to non us government customers  or they would be allowed to buy the satellites at a discount cost 
we are closely monitoring this initiative for any further developments 
as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may inquire about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
the government could make claims against us if the results of such audits or investigations warrant such action 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended from bidding on or being awarded new government contracts for a period of time or debarment for a period of time 
we are not aware of any such audits or investigations against us at this time 
we are also exposed to risks associated with us government contracting such as technological uncertainties and obsolescence  and dependence on congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
the nature of our products and services exposes us to certain risks associated with state of the art technologies such as delays  cost growth and product failure 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the us department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently not aware of any violations of export control regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations  cash flows or our financial position 
we continually explore opportunities to expand into adjacent product lines utilizing our existing advanced technology products 
we are exploring select acquisitions as well as potential joint ventures  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services 
we may use some of the cash generated by our thornton operations  which are not subject to the restrictions contained in our senior note agreements described below  for acquisitions or joint ventures 
some of these business arrangements may include foreign partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in currency values and regulation by foreign countries or possible deterioration of political relations 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management bases their estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting areas that require the most significant management estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and contract accounting 
our principal source of revenue is the sale of satellite imagery to customers  distributors and value added resellers 
such sales often require us to provide imagery over the term of multi year sales contracts under take or pay arrangements whereby customers pay for access time regardless of usage 
accordingly  we recognize revenues on such imagery contracts on a straight line basis over the delivery term of the contract 
otherwise we record revenues based on the delivery of imagery to our customer 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of the delivery of imagery 
as stated previously  nga is supporting the nextview program with a cost share totaling approximately million spread out over the course of the construction phase of the project and subject to various milestones 
these nga payments are recorded as deferred revenue when received and will be recognized as revenue from when the geoeye satellite is placed into service through the anticipated imagery purchase period under the program  which we believe will ultimately approximate the life of the satellite 
a portion of our business is derived from long term fixed price contracts with the us government and commercial customers 
revenue under such contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based upon the percentage of costs incurred in the applicable reporting period as compared to the most recent estimates of costs to complete each period 
these incurred costs approximate the output of deliverables to our customers 
revenue under ground station modifications  which are usually less than one year in duration  are recognized using the completed contract method of accounting 
costs of the project are initially recorded on the balance sheet and ultimately recorded as cost of goods sold upon completion of the project 
we also derive revenues for maintenance of certain of these ground stations for our customers  which we account for under the straight line method 
revenue for production type contracts is recognized using the units of delivery method  a modification of the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recognized based on the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment 
management bases its estimate on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
costs to complete include  when appropriate  labor  subcontracting costs and materials  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
reviews of the status of contracts are performed through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
we have not incurred any material changes in estimates on our imagery and image processing contracts with the us government 
some of our contracts with nga consist of multiple elements 
for contracts consisting of multiple elements  we identify these elements and consider whether the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we evaluate such contracts to ensure that  for purposes of determining standalone value  performance of any one element of the contract is not directly contingent on performance of the other contract elements 
revenue recognition may be impacted if nonperformance of one contract element causes the customer to terminate the other element s 
such contracts are also subject to  among other things  termination rights  refunds of payments due to unsatisfactory performance and uncertainty regarding availability of future funding 
receivables 
a significant amount of judgment is required by management in estimating the reserves required for receivables that are potentially uncollectible 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
if collection of the receivable is not reasonably assured at the time services are performed  we do not initially record the revenue  but rather record an allowance for customer credits to offset the receivable 
if there is a change in the customer s financial status or the receivable is collected  revenue is recorded at that time 
while such credit losses described above have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will experience the same credit loss rates that we have estimated or historically experienced 
as such  additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections 
long lived assets 
depreciation of the capitalized costs of our satellites begins when the satellites are placed into service 
we depreciate the ground systems assets over the estimated lives of the related satellite assets 
depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method 
we amortized the cost of the orbview satellite over the year design life of the satellite 
this amortization ended in the second quarter of we began depreciating the cost of the ikonos satellite upon acquisition in january in assessing the recoverability of our satellites  fixed assets and other long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of those assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that certain long lived fixed assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
estimated future cash flows could be impacted by  among other things  changes in estimates of the useful lives of the assets eg  degradation in the quality of images downloaded from the satellite  changes in estimates of our ability to operate the assets at expected levels eg  due to intermittent loss of satellite transmissions and by the loss of one or several significant customer contracts 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year and when events and circumstances warrant such a review in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of fair value in determining the amount of impairment  if any  for recorded goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we calculate the fair market value at a reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the fair market value  impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
an impairment test was performed on recorded goodwill and it was determined that no impairment existed at december  and income taxes 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax related assets and liabilities and income tax provisions 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed probable that certain tax positions will be sustained 
we established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets upon emergence from bankruptcy since  based on information available at that time  it was deemed more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
during the quarter ended december   we determined that  despite having operating income and positive operating cash flows for the past two years  that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future 
accordingly  we determined that it was appropriate to retain the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
results of operations revenues 
revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in was attributable to a million increase in deliveries of production services under contracts with the us government principally nga and a million increase in imagery sales  most of which also was attributable to nga 
the us government is our largest customer  with revenues of approximately million or percent 
the remaining variance is attributable to increases and decreases across the company s other businesses  namely the inclusion of the operations of mj harden associates  inc  which was acquired in march all of the million increase in revenues over resulted from the operations acquired from space imaging 
revenues generated by the operations acquired from space imaging  which are now reported by the company s opco subsidiary  were million for the period from january  to december  excluding the acquired operations  revenues were comparable with the prior year 
in  our contracts under the clearview program provided for nga to pay us a minimum of million for ikonos related imagery products and million for orbview related imagery products 
direct expenses 
direct expenses include the costs of operating and depreciating the satellites  aircraft and production facilities as well as the related costs associated with the company owned and affiliate owned ground stations 
labor expenses and depreciation represent the largest components of direct expenses 
direct expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  total depreciation and amortization expense recorded in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in direct expenses in over is mainly attributable to the absence of depreciation expense associated with the orbview satellite 
as discussed in further detail below  the orbview satellite experienced technical problems which affected its image quality and was declared permanently out of service in the first quarter of consequently  the book value of the satellite and related ground station assets were written off in  resulting in the absence of approximately million of depreciation expense associated with those assets 
as discussed below  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the loss of the satellite which was offset by the receipt of insurance proceeds 
the remaining million increase in direct expenses in is attributable mainly to volume increases in our production and other services businesses 
the million increase in direct expenses in over is attributable to the expenses incurred by the acquired space imaging operations 
direct expenses incurred by the operations acquired from space imaging were million for the period from january  to december  direct expenses for excluding the acquired operations were million  which was comparable with the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotion and other selling expenses  as well as the costs of the finance  administrative and general management functions of the company 
sg a expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
principally all of the increase resulted from increases in headcount and increased stock based compensation expense over the prior year 
sg a expenses increased by million in due to the additional expenses associated with the acquired operations from space imaging 
excluding those expenses  sg a expenses for increased by million as a result of increased staffing requirements across many of the company s sales and administrative functions 
net gain on satellite insurance proceeds 
on march   the company s orbview satellite began to experience technical problems which affected its image quality 
the company and the vendors who built the orbview spacecraft and ground systems spent several weeks troubleshooting the problem  and identified the problem to a specific unit within the camera electronics 
on april   we announced that the satellite had been declared permanently out of service 
though we continue to be in communication with and in control of orbview  the satellite no longer produces usable imagery 
we recorded a loss of million in the first quarter of this loss consists of a million write off of the remaining book value of the satellite as well as a million write off of the related ground system hardware and software 
these amounts were offset by the write off of the remaining on orbit incentive obligation payable to orbital sciences corporation  the manufacturer of the satellite  of million 
the orbview satellite was insured for million 
we submitted a million insurance claim on june  and received the proceeds during the third quarter of upon receipt of the proceeds  we wrote off approximately million of the remaining prepaid insurance premiums resulting in a net gain of million which recorded in the third quarter of as a result of the loss of the orbview satellite  we reallocated imagery resources from the ikonos satellite to satisfy customers imagery needs when possible 
the ikonos satellite has sufficient collection capacity that we believe will continue to satisfy contractual requirements until the launch of geoeye although orbview is not collecting new imagery  we continue to offer archived orbview products for sale 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the amount represents interest expense incurred on our senior floating rate notes of million which includes million of amortized prepaid financing costs and million of discount amortization and excludes million of capitalized interest expense 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the senior floating rate notes was percent  which is fixed through the use of an interest rate swap 
in addition  interest expense includes the write off of previously unamortized prepaid financing costs and discount amortization on debt associated with the space imaging acquisition of million due to the early payoff of the loan 
interest income for was approximately million 
the amount represents interest expense incurred on our senior floating rate notes of million which includes million of amortized prepaid financing costs and excludes million of capitalized interest expense and interest expense incurred on our senior secured term loans incurred in conjunction with the space imaging acquisition of million which includes million of amortized prepaid financing costs and million of discount amortization 
interest income for was approximately million 
the interest expense amount represents interest expense of million on the company s senior floating rate notes which includes million of amortized prepaid financing costs and excludes million of capitalized interest expense and million of interest expense incurred on orbimage inc s senior notes and senior subordinated notes  which were repaid in the first quarter and second quarter of  respectively 
the senior notes and senior subordinated notes incurred interest at an annual rate of percent in  payable in cash on a semiannual basis 
interest income for was approximately million 
loss from early extinguishment of debt 
on march   orbimage repaid its senior notes due out of existing cash received pursuant to the exercise of warrants by certain investors during the first quarter of this payment included million representing interest expense that would have been payable through june   the date of the initial interest payment  in accordance with the terms of the associated indenture agreement 
included in the loss amount is approximately million which represents the write off of the unamortized portion of consent fee payments paid in to the note holders to allow the company to use its cash flows from existing operations toward project costs for the geoeye satellite  and approximately million represents incentive payments to certain executive officers for refinancing the notes prior to their maturity in  under the terms of an employment agreement entered into in unrealized gain on derivative instrument 
in june  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effectively hedging million of its libor based floating rate term debt for three years  ending july  as a result of entering into the agreement  the interest rate to be paid by the company relating to the hedged portion of its debt will be fixed at percent rather than on a three month libor plus percent 
although the interest rate swap agreement provides us with an economic hedge against interest rate risk  we are applying mark to market accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the effect of which is the inclusion in net earnings of any increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments 
we recorded an unrealized loss on this derivative instrument of million for the year ended december  and a gain of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million for  million for and for the increase in the provision in over principally reflects the usage  in  of net operating loss carryforwards which accumulated during these nols were fully utilized in no income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended december  due to uncertainty regarding sufficiency of taxable income in future periods 
the company has preliminarily determined that its prior conclusions regarding an ownership change in control as provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as well as similar state provisions were incorrect and that a change in control may have occurred in since we currently believe that a change may have occurred in then as this change of control occurred within two years of the company s emergence from chapter  utilization of the company s pre reorganization nol carryforwards are eliminated 
the company has utilized its post reorganization carryforwards against taxable income generated in and through the third quarter of in the third quarter of the taxable income exceeded the post acquisition losses and therefore the company has restated its third quarter tax provision and has recorded an additional provision for income taxes of million 
the company will have a payment obligation if its final determination is that a change of control took place in the company is vigorously pursuing the matter 
if the company is able to conclude that a change of control for section purposes did not take place  the company plans to reinstate its pre reorganization nol carryforwards and apply them against taxable income in and as well as future periods to reduce any taxes payable 
if the pre reorganization nols are available  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  reductions in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance that existed at the date of fresh start accounting are first credited against an asset established for reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets  then to other identifiable intangible assets existing at the date of fresh start accounting and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited directly to additional paid in capital
