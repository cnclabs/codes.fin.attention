item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
at december   we operated outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics in states  including those described in the star acquisition below 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
we have developed of the clinics and acquired in  we added clinics  including developed and acquired  and closed including one that was acquired in 
effective september   the company acquired a majority interest in star  a multi partner outpatient rehabilitation practice with operations in the southeast united states 
star owns and operates 
table of contents outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics and manages seven other facilities for third parties 
therefore  the figures include four months of results for the star clinics acquired in september in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with ten third party facilities including those related to the star acquisition under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at contracted amounts different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system does not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period 
therefore  in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  our management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally reflected a difference within approximately of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis reflects a difference within approximately between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 

table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding our accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december gross accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable the following table presents our accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 
historically  approximately of balances are reclassified into self pay from other categories primarily managed care  medicare and other after all expected payments are received from third party payors 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our federal and state income tax liability  as well as assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements for tax and for accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we periodically assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a model for how a company is to recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain positions that a company has taken or plans to take on a future tax return 
under fin  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon 
table of contents examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits for federal  state and local tax jurisdictions in may the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fin  definition of a settlement in fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
in determining whether a tax position has been effectively settled  entities must evaluate i whether taxing authorities have completed their examination procedures  ii whether the entity intends to appeal or litigate any aspect of a tax position included in a completed evaluation  and iii whether it is remote that a taxing authority would examine or re examine any aspect of a taxing position 
fin was applied upon the initial adoption of fin there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations due to the implementation of fin and fin carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
this accounting standard requires that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment or intangible assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
also  if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of net income 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to apply these valuation techniques 
irrespective of our valuation analysis  future market conditions may deteriorate 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
in  no goodwill was written off due to impairment based upon our annual analysis 
see note significant accounting policies goodwill of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item in  goodwill of  was written off due to clinic closings and such amount is included in discontinued operations  net of the tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statement of net income 
selected operating and financial data during  we closed unprofitable clinics 
in accordance with current accounting literature  the results of operations and closure costs for these clinics and the results of operations for the clinic sold in are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented  net of the tax benefit 
the operating results of the clinics closed in were not material to the operations of the company and therefore the operating results of those clinics were not reclassified and reported as discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources we believe that our business is generating sufficient cash flow from operating activities to allow us to meet our short term and long term cash requirements  other than those with respect to future acquisitions 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million including  of marketable securities at december   a decrease of 
although the start up costs associated with opening new clinics and our planned capital expenditures are significant  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability on our revolving credit facility are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  clinic closure costs accrued  future clinic development and investments through at least december significant acquisitions would likely require financing under our existing revolving credit facility 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million in a money market fund 

table of contents the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million from december  to december  was due primarily to cash used for the star acquisition million 
other major uses of cash included purchase of fixed assets million  purchase of intangibles limited partner interests  payment for earn out related to a business acquisition million  distributions to limited partners million  payments on revolving credit agreement and notes payable million 
during  million was provided by operations  million proceeds from the revolving credit facility and million from proceeds and tax benefit of exercise of stock options 
effective august   we entered into the credit agreement with a commitment for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement can be increased to million subject to certain terms and conditions 
the credit agreement has a four year term  is unsecured and includes standard financial covenants 
proceeds from the credit agreement may be used to finance acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes 
interest expense on borrowings is based on a pricing grid tied to our overall financial leverage with the applicable spread over libor ranging from 
to 
there are fees under the credit agreement including a closing fee of 
and an unused commitment fee ranging from 
to 
depending on financial leverage and the amount of funds outstanding under the agreement 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and to cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them  which requires less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and make additional acquisitions in select markets 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any acquisition or purchase of minority interests is expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash and financing 
any large acquisition would likely require financing 
we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect accounts receivable  including applicable deductible and co payment amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor types 
claims are submitted to payors daily  weekly or monthly in accordance with our policy or payor s requirements 
when possible  we submit our claims electronically 
the collection process is time consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor 
claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect 
medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting medicare rehab agency status approval initially may not be submitted for six months or more 
when all reasonable internal collection efforts have been exhausted  accounts are written off prior to sending them to outside collection firms 
with managed care  commercial health plans and self pay payor type receivables  the write off generally occurs after the account receivable has been outstanding for days 
we have future obligations for debt repayments  employment agreements and future minimum rentals under operating leases 
the obligations as of december  are summarized as follows in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter notes payable employee agreements operating leases in connection with the star acquisition  we incurred notes payable in the aggregate totaling  payable in equal annual installments totaling  beginning september  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
interest accrues at a fixed rate of per annum 
the remaining principal and any accrued and unpaid interest then outstanding is due and payable on september  in addition  we assumed leases with remaining terms ranging from months to years for the operating facilities 
in conjunction with the acquisition of an eight clinic practice in arizona in november  we entered into a note payable with the sellers in the amount of  payable in equal quarterly principal installments of  beginning march   plus any accrued and unpaid interest

the remaining principal and any accrued and unpaid interest then outstanding is due and payable on the third anniversary of the note  november  the purchase agreement also provides for possible contingent consideration of up to  based on the achievement of a certain designated level of operating results within a three year period following the acquisition 
in addition  we assumed leases with remaining terms ranging from one to five years for six of the eight operating facilities 
with respect to the two remaining leased facilities  one is being leased on a month to month basis and the other was renewed for three years effective february  in december  we paid  additional consideration related to this acquisition upon achievement of the predefined operating results for the first year  and such amount was added to goodwill

the remaining principal and any accrued and unpaid interest then outstanding is due and payable on the third anniversary of the note  may  the purchase agreement provides for possible contingent consideration of up to  based on the achievement of a certain designated level of operating results within a three year period following the acquisition 
in july  we paid  additional consideration related to this acquisition upon achievement of the predefined operating results for the first year and such amount was added to goodwill 
in conjunction with the above mentioned acquisitions  in the event that a minority partner s employment ceases at any time after three years from the acquisition date  the company has agreed to repurchase that individual s minority partner interest at a predetermined multiple of earning before interest and taxes 
since september  the board of directors board has authorized us to purchase  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to  shares of its common stock 
as of december   there were approximately  shares remaining that could be purchased under these programs 
since there is no expiration date for these share repurchase programs  additional shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions depending on price  availability and our cash position 
shares purchased are held as treasury shares and may be used for such valid corporate purposes or retired as the board considers advisable 
during the year ended december   the company purchased  shares of its common stock on the open market for million 
we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases for its executive offices and clinic facilities discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recently promulgated accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as a result of sfas  there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve 
table of contents disclosures about those measures 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  management has evaluated the impact of the statement on the company and does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  or january  for the company 
early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
management has evaluated the impact of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements and does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  and applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer  upon initially obtaining control of another entity  to recognize the assets  liabilities and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
this fair value approach replaces the cost allocation process required under sfas no 
whereby the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
sfas no 
r requires acquirers to expense acquisition related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as was previously the case under sfas no 
under sfas no 
r  the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities would have to be met in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting 
pre acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at fair value  unless it is a non contractual contingency that is not likely to materialize  in which case  nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting and  instead  that contingency would be subject to the probable and estimable recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
r may have a significant impact on our accounting for business combinations closing on or after january  in december the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest formerly referred to as minority interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to a noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  sfas requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gains or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of the adoption of this standard on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   we had clinics in operation  of which were opened and acquired in for those newly opened clinics  we incurred an operating loss in generally we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be 
table of contents lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
generally  patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues tend to increase significantly during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
based on historical performance of our new clinics  generally the clinics opened in would be expected to favorably impact our results of operations beginning in the mid to latter part of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not maintain any derivative instruments  interest rate swap arrangements  hedging contracts  futures contracts or the like 
our only indebtedness as of december  was seller notes of million and outstanding balance on our credit agreement of million 
the outstanding balance under the credit agreement is subject to fluctuating interest rates 
a change in the interest rate would yield an additional  of interest expense
