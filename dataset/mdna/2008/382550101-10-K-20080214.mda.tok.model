item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires  with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
in  we operated our business through five operating segments representing our regional tire businesses north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
as a result of our sale of substantially all of our engineered products business  we have reported the results of that segment as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  all disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relate to continuing operations 
we have been implementing strategies to drive top line growth  reduce costs  improve our capital structure and focus on core businesses where we can achieve profitable growth 
during  we continued to make progress in implementing these strategies through the following accomplishments our recovery from the fourth quarter usw strike was faster and less costly than anticipated  we continued to make progress on our four point cost savings plan  we have taken significant steps in the veba approval process  we announced significant changes to our us based retail and salaried employees pension and retiree benefit plans  and we completed our capital structure improvement plan 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   we had net income of million compared to a net loss of million in we recorded income from continuing operations in of million  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in in addition  our total segment operating income for was  million compared to million in see result of operations segment information for additional information 
operating income improved in by approximately million as a result of returning to normal sales and production levels following the usw strike  which negatively impacted the fourth quarter of and part of the first quarter of the impact of the strike in was less than originally anticipated primarily due to north american tire s ability to ramp up production faster than expected and to emphasize production of higher margin replacement tires 
our results were impacted favorably by price and product mix improvements and favorable foreign currency translation  partially offset by decreased volumes  primarily due to the usw strike and our decision to exit certain segments of the private label tire business  higher raw material costs  and increased selling  administrative and general expense 
four point cost savings plan we have announced a four point cost savings plan which includes continuous improvement programs  reducing high cost manufacturing capacity  leveraging our global position by increasing low cost country sourcing  and reducing selling  administrative and general expense 
we expect to achieve between billion and billion of aggregate gross cost savings from through the expected cost reductions consist of from billion to billion of estimated savings related to continuous improvement initiatives  including safety programs  business process improvements  such as six sigma and lean manufacturing  and product reformulations  and ongoing savings that we expect to achieve from our master labor agreement with the usw through december   we estimate we have achieved over million in savings under these initiatives  
table of contents over million of estimated savings from the reduction of high cost manufacturing capacity by over million units we estimate that announced reductions to date will result in approximately million of savings when complete  between million to million of estimated savings related to our sourcing strategy of increasing our procurement of tires  raw materials  capital equipment and indirect materials from low cost countries through december   we estimate we have achieved nearly million in savings under this strategy  from million to million of estimated savings from reductions in selling  administrative and general expense related to initiatives including benefit plan changes  back office and warehouse consolidations and headcount reductions through december   we estimate we have achieved more than million in savings under these efforts 
execution of our four point cost savings plan and realization of the projected savings is critical to our success 
voluntary employees beneficiary association during the fourth quarter of  the us district court for the northern district of ohio preliminarily approved the settlement agreement filed by the usw  the retiree class representatives and goodyear that would result in the establishment of the veba and set the date for a hearing regarding the settlement agreement 
following that hearing  the district court will determine whether to grant final approval of the settlement agreement 
the savings we expect to achieve from the veba are included in our anticipated continuous improvement savings described above under four point cost savings plan 
pension and benefit plan changes in february  we announced various changes to our us based retail and salaried employee pension and retiree benefit plans 
these changes will be phased in over a two year period  with most benefit plan changes effective in and the most significant pension plan changes effective in as a result of the changes  we achieved after tax savings of million in  and expect to achieve after tax savings of million to million in  and million to million in and beyond 
the ongoing savings are included in our targeted savings from continuous improvement initiatives and reductions in selling  administrative and general expense described above under four point cost savings plan 
we recorded a curtailment charge of million related to these actions in the first quarter of capital structure improvement plan in april  we completed a refinancing of three of our primary credit facilities  which extended maturities  reduced applicable interest rates and provides us with a more flexible covenant package 
in may  we completed a public equity offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share  raising million before offering costs 
we used a portion of the million net proceeds from the equity offering to exercise our rights to redeem million of our million senior notes due and million of our million senior notes due in in july  we completed the sale of our engineered products business for billion  which marked the completion of our capital structure improvement plan that we began in we recognized an after tax gain on the sale of our engineered products business of million  or per share  which is reported in discontinued operations 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we repaid our million third lien secured term loan due during the fourth quarter of  we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding convertible senior notes due for a cash payment and shares of our common stock 
the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of million shares of common stock  a total cash payment  including accrued and unpaid interest  of million  and a reduction of debt of million 
on february   we issued notices of redemption to the holders of our million senior secured notes due that redemption will occur on march  
table of contents new products at our north american dealer conference in early february we continued our transformation to a market driven  consumer focused company with the introduction of the goodyear assurance and the eagle gt tires 
the assurance is a mid tier passenger tire and joins the brand s two premium offerings in that segment assurance comfortred and assurance tripletred 
it is targeted at the everyday consumer and designed to deliver enhanced traction and responsive handling 
the new eagle gt is positioned within the goodyear eagle performance tire family as a mid tier entry  complementing the brand s three premium ultra high performance offerings  including the eagle f gs d  the eagle f all season  and the eagle f asymmetric 
we expect to introduce additional new tires in key market segments in industry volume estimates our industry volume estimates for our two largest regions are as follows in north america we estimate consumer oe volume will be down to  and commercial oe volume will be up to reflecting a recovery in demand following weak industry volumes which were driven by regulations regarding new commercial vehicle emission standards 
north american consumer and commercial replacement volumes are both expected to be flat to up 
in europe  consumer oe volume is expected to be up to  and commercial oe volume is expected to be up to 
we expect consumer replacement volume to be flat to up and commercial replacement volume to be up to 
our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or the oe industry  which would result in lower levels of plant utilization and an increase in unit costs 
also  we could experience higher raw material and energy costs in future periods 
these costs  if incurred  may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market and we may not be able to continue improving our product mix 
our future results of operations are also dependent on our ability to successfully implement our cost reduction programs and address increasing competition from low cost manufacturers 
we are unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens against various foreign currencies  or if economic conditions deteriorate in the economies in which we operate 
continued volatile economic conditions or changes in government policies in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
for additional factors that may impact our business and results of operations please see risk factors at page results of operations consolidated all per share amounts are diluted compared to for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in the comparable period of income from continuing operations in was million  or per share  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  in net sales net sales in were billion  increasing million  or compared to net sales in were impacted favorably by price and product mix of million and favorable currency translation of million  primarily in european union tire 
these increases were partially offset by decreased volume of million  net of million of higher sales volume in compared to as a result of the usw strike 
the decrease in volume is primarily attributable to north american tire  due to our june decision to exit the certain segments of the private label tire business  in addition to lower sales from other tire related businesses of million

north american tire consumer replacement volume decreased million units  or due to a strategic share reduction in the lower value segment following our decision to exit certain segments of the private label tire business  partially offset by increased share of our higher value branded products 
european union tire consumer replacement volume decreased million units  or compared to  which was primarily market and strategy driven 
the decrease in replacement volume was partially offset by an increase in eastern europe tire replacement volume of million units or 
oe units sales in decreased by million units  or  due primarily to decreases in north american tire  driven by lower vehicle production  and eastern europe tire  due to the exit of non profitable business 
this decrease in oe unit sales was partially offset by increases in latin america tire and european union tire 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold cgs was billion in  an increase of million  or compared to the period 
cgs decreased to of sales in compared to in cgs increased in due to higher foreign currency translation of million  product mix related cost increases of million  primarily related to north america tire and european union tire  higher raw material costs of million  and increased conversion costs of million 
also increasing cgs were increased research and development expenses of million  a curtailment charge of million related to the benefit plan changes announced in the first quarter of  and increased costs of approximately million related to production inefficiencies and a strike in south africa 
partially offsetting these increases was lower volume of million  primarily related to north american tire  higher savings from restructuring plans of million  lower accelerated depreciation of million  and decreased costs related to other tire related businesses of million 
was also affected by a pension plan curtailment gain of million and million related to favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers

these increases were partially offset by decreases in employee benefit costs of million  primarily related to north american tire  and higher savings from restructuring plans of million 
interest expense interest expense was million  an increase of million during as compared to interest expense in was adversely impacted by higher debt levels incurred during the usw strike  but was favorably affected by a reduction in outstanding debt following the end of the strike and the early retirement of various debt obligations during interest expense in is expected to decline relative to due primarily to lower average debt levels 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income in  a decrease of million compared to million of income in the decrease was primarily due to higher financing fees of million primarily relating to our redemption of million of long term debt  our exchange offer for our outstanding convertible senior notes and our refinancing activities in april in addition  we incurred higher losses of million on foreign currency exchange in primarily as a result of the weakening us dollar versus the euro  chilean peso and brazilian real 
other income was also unfavorably impacted by lower net gains on asset sales of approximately million in compared to primarily as a result of a loss of million million net of minority interest on the sale of substantially all of the assets of north american tire s tire and wheel assembly operation in the fourth quarter of in there was a fire in our thailand facility  which resulted in a loss of million  net of insurance proceeds 
the decrease in other income was partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately million due primarily to higher cash balances in in addition  other income was favorably impacted by a decrease of approximately million in expenses related to general and product liabilities  including asbestos and entran ii claims

the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate was primarily due to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed below 
income tax expense in includes a net tax benefit totaling million  which consists of a tax benefit of million per share related to prior periods offset by a million charge primarily related to recently enacted tax law changes 
the out of period adjustment related to our correction of the inflation adjustment on equity of our subsidiary in colombia as a permanent tax benefit rather than as a temporary tax benefit dating back as far as  with no individual year being significantly affected 
income tax expense in included net favorable tax adjustments totaling million 
the adjustments for related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position regarding a reorganization of certain legal entities in  which was partially offset by a charge of million to establish a foreign valuation allowance  attributable to a rationalization plan 
our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in these foreign locations 
however  it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all  or a portion  of these valuation allowances within the next months will exist  resulting in one time tax benefits of up to million million net of minority interest

the savings realized in for the plans totaled approximately million million cgs and million sag 
in addition  savings realized in for the plans totaled approximately million million cgs and million sag compared to our estimate of million 
savings related to rationalization activities is less than the prior year estimate primarily due to the tyler plant closure not occurring in as planned  the discontinuation of tire production at valleyfield not realizing a full year of savings  and plan changes and implementation delays

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies what criteria must be met prior to recognizing the financial statement benefit of a position taken in a tax return and requires companies to include additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to such positions within their financial statements 
the disclosures include potential tax benefits from positions taken for tax return purposes that have not been recognized for financial reporting purposes and a tabular presentation of significant changes during each period 
the disclosures also include a discussion of the nature of uncertainties  factors which could cause a change  and an estimated range of reasonably possible changes in tax uncertainties 
fin also requires a company to recognize a financial statement benefit for a position taken for tax return purposes when it will be more likely than not that the position will be sustained

sfas no 
addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition and disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
will require the fair value of an asset or liability to be based on market based measures which will reflect the credit risk of the company

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
our critical accounting policies relate to general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions  and pensions and other postretirement benefits 

table of contents general and product liability and other litigation 
general and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss  which may have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
we engage an independent asbestos valuation firm  bates white  llc bates  to review our existing reserves for pending asbestos claims  provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims  and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries related to such claims 
a significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase may be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million 
at december   we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities could exceed our recorded reserve by to million  approximately of which would be recoverable by our accessible policy limits 
we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration relevant factors  including ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts 
bates also assists us in valuing receivables to be recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by bates  as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable up to our accessible policy limits 
the receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts receivable at december  in addition to asbestos claims  we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our entran ii rubber hose product 
during  we entered into a settlement agreement to address a substantial portion of our entran ii liabilities 
the claims associated with the plaintiffs that opted not to participate in the settlement are evaluated in a manner consistent with our other litigation claims 
we had recorded liabilities related to entran ii claims of million at december  workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  of million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation claims at december  the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically  and at least annually  update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return

recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
rather  these assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be allocated to various reporting units  which are either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below the operating segment 
we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments as determined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our reporting units for purposes of applying the provisions of sfas no 
are comprised of five strategic business units north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
during  there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated 
for purposes of our annual impairment testing  which is conducted as of july each year  we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based on an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple of comparable companies 
the ebitda multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions 
the ebitda of the reporting units are based on a combination of historical and forecasted results and are adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges 
significant decreases in ebitda in future periods may be an indication of a potential impairment 
additionally  valuation multiples of comparable companies would have to decline in excess of to indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
goodwill was million and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were million at december  our annual impairment analysis for indicated no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in addition  there were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment test should be re performed at december  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions 
at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets under no 
sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher by standard poor s as of december and is reviewed annually 
the total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over periods of years or more  asset class return expectations and long term inflation 
these assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate 
changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected 
the discount rates used in estimating the total liability for our us pension and other postretirement plans were and  respectively  at december   compared to at december  and at december  for both our us pension and other postretirement plans 
the increase in the discount rate at december  was due primarily to higher interest rates on highly rated corporate bonds 
interest cost included in our us net periodic pension cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost was lower in as a result of the reduction in the postretirement liability due to plan amendments and actuarial gains 
the weighted average amortization period for employees covered by our us plans is approximately years

table of contents overall decline in us discount rates over time 
for purposes of determining our us net periodic pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses in given no change to the assumptions at our december  measurement  actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
the actual rate of return on our us pension fund was  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the expected rate of for all three years 
we use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for substantially all of our pension plans 
the service cost of our us pension plans was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the expense reflects the suspension of pension service credit agreed to in our labor contract 
this suspension expired on november  although we experienced an increase in our us discount rate at the end of  a large portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
the unrecognized actuarial loss decreased from primarily due to the increase in the discount rate at december  for purposes of determining worldwide net periodic postretirement benefits cost  we recognized million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition will gradually decline from the levels

covenant ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results  but rather as a measure of these limitations imposed under our credit facilities 
covenant ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to either i income from operations or ii cash flows from operating activities 
our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
as a limitation on our ability to incur debt in accordance with our credit facilities could affect our liquidity  we believe that the presentation of covenant ebitda provides investors with important information 
the following table presents the calculation of ebitda and the calculation of covenant ebitda in accordance with the definitions in our amended and restated credit facilities for the periods indicated 
other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do 
certain line items are presented as defined in the credit facilities and do not reflect amounts as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
those line items also include discontinued operations

voluntary employees beneficiary association on december   the usw ratified the terms of a new master labor agreement ending a strike by the usw 
in connection with the master labor agreement  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the usw regarding the establishment of a veba intended to provide healthcare benefits for current and future usw retirees 
the establishment of the veba is conditioned upon receiving district court approval of a settlement of a declaratory judgment action 
on july   the usw and several retirees filed a required class action lawsuit regarding the establishment of the veba in the us district court for the northern district of ohio 
on october   the parties filed the signed settlement agreement within the district court  and on december   the district court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and established the date for a hearing regarding the settlement 
we plan to make our contributions to the veba entirely in cash following the us district court s approval of the settlement 
in addition  we expect to remove our liability for usw retiree healthcare benefits from 
table of contents our balance sheet when this settlement has received final judicial approval including exhaustion of all appeals  if any and we have made our contributions to the veba 
we expect to use cash on hand and generated from operating activities  unused availability under our various credit agreements and or proceeds from the sale of our engineered products business to fund the veba 
we do not expect our veba funding commitment or our inability to immediately remove our liability for usw retiree healthcare benefits from our balance sheet to have a significant impact on our liquidity or cash position 
furthermore  we do not expect our plan to fund the veba entirely in cash to have a significant impact on our operations or liquidity 
potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction  possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
future liquidity requirements also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing  we can incur additional indebtedness under the credit facilities following the payment  and certain financial tests are satisfied 
asset dispositions the restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses  and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions 
commitments and contingent liabilities contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  payment due by period as of december  st nd rd th th after in millions total year year year year year years long term debt capital lease obligations interest payments operating leases pension benefits other post retirement benefits workers compensation binding commitments uncertain income tax positions long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of december  our million senior secured notes due are included in the table as maturing in the th year 
however  on february   we called for the redemption of all outstanding amounts on march  
table of contents the present value of capital lease obligations is million 
these amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements 
payments related to variable debt are based on the six month libor rate at december  plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented 
the amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt 
no interest payments for the million senior secured notes were assumed beyond march   the date of the redemption 
operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million  million  million  million  million  and million in each of the periods above  respectively  for a total of million 
payments  net of minimum sublease rentals  total  million 
the present value of the net operating lease payments is million 
the operating leases relate to  among other things  real estate  vehicles  data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets 
no asset is leased from any related party 
the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of december  although subject to change  the amounts set forth in the table for the st year  the nd year and the rd year represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current erisa law  and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non us pension plans  plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non us pension plans 
for years after  the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans  plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non us pension plans  and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non us pension plans 
the expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions  including an erisa liability interest rate of for  for  for  for  and for  and plan asset returns of for and beyond 
future contributions are also effected by other factors such as future interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions 
the payments presented above are expected payments for the next years 
the payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect 
under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans 
the obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis 
the estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of these amounts will be reduced significantly provided the proposed settlement with the usw regarding retiree healthcare becomes effective 
the payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims 
the present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is million 
binding commitments are for our normal operations and are related primarily to obligations to acquire land  buildings and equipment 
in addition  binding commitments includes obligations to purchase raw materials through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
these amounts represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of december  we have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters 
additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities 
these other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature 
we 
table of contents cannot  with any degree of reliability  determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled 
accordingly  these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table 
in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which cannot be estimated  are not included in the table above the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sri  as set forth in the umbrella agreement between sri and us  provide for certain minority exit rights available to sri commencing in in addition  the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the umbrella agreement  including certain bankruptcy events or changes in our control  could trigger a right of sri to require us to purchase their interests in the global alliance immediately 
sri s exit rights  in the unlikely event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of sri s exit rights  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interests in the global alliance 
the umbrella agreement provides that the payment amount would be based on the fair value of sri s minority shareholder s interest in each of goodyear dunlop tires europe bv and goodyear dunlop tires north america  ltd 
and the book value of net assets of the japanese joint ventures 
the payment amount would be determined through a negotiation process where  if no mutually agreed amount was determined  a binding arbitration process would determine that amount

description of goodyear s business global alliance 
pursuant to certain long term agreements  we will purchase minimum amounts of a raw material at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments 
we do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts 
we generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term  intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
we may  however  from time to time  enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets  undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements 
those guarantees were not significant at december  for further information about our guarantees  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no

such statements are based on current expectations 
table of contents and assumptions  are inherently uncertain  are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution 
actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected  a significant aspect of our master labor agreement with the usw is subject to court approval  which  if not received  could result in the termination and renegotiation of the agreement  we face significant global competition  increasingly from lower cost manufacturers  and our market share could decline  our pension plans are underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expenses  higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may materially adversely affect our business  pending litigation relating to our restatement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness  is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results  we have a substantial amount of debt  which could restrict our growth  place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health  any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations  our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner  our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly  we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims  our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties  the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded  we may be required to deposit cash collateral to support an appeal bond if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results  our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results  we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results  the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sri provide for certain exit rights available to sri in or thereafter  upon the occurrence of certain events  which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interest in certain of our joint venture alliances which include much of our operations in europe  if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially adversely affected  
table of contents work stoppages  financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our suppliers or our major oe customers could harm our business  and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control  such as war  acts of terror  political unrest  public health concerns  labor disputes or natural disasters 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
we will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts  events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  fabrics  steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities 
approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives  whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 
we currently do not hedge commodity prices 
we do  however  use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials  including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power and expand our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials 
interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
we will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging compared to at an average rate of at december  the decrease in the average variable interest rate was driven by decreases in the spread associated with our variable rate debt as a result of our april refinancing 
we also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
as a result of credit ratings actions and other related events  our access to these instruments may be limited 
there were no contracts outstanding at december  or weighted average interest rate swap contract information follows dollars in millions fixed rate contracts notional principal amount pay fixed rate receive variable libor floating rate contracts notional principal amount pay variable libor receive fixed rate the following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt  including capital leases  at december in millions carrying amount liability fair value liability pro forma fair value liability 
table of contents the pro forma information assumes a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve 
the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation 
the following table presents foreign currency forward contract information at december in millions fair value asset pro forma decrease in fair value contract maturities we were not a party to any foreign currency option contracts at december  or the pro forma change in fair value assumes a decrease in foreign exchange rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models
