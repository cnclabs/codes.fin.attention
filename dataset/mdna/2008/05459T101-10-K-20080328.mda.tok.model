we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect actual outcomes 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and manufacture fixed wireless voice and broadband data products for the worldwide telecommunications market 
our product portfolio includes fixed wireless desktop phones  public call office pco phones  voice data terminals  broadband modems  and g gateway devices for access to voice calling and high speed data services 
our products have similar functionality to phones and modems that use the traditional landline telecommunications network  however  they are wireless devices and can be substituted for wired phones and modems 
most of our products sold to date have been based on cdma g code division multiple access technology developed by qualcomm incorporated 
we are increasing our focus on new products based on gsm global system for mobile communications and gprs general packet radio service technologies to enhance our product offering and expand our market 
in addition to the introduction of gsm and gprs based products  we have increased our focus on the development of data products  including broadband modems and g gateway devices  which represent an increasing percentage of our overall revenues we currently sell our products to telecommunications operators in developing countries where large segments of the population do not have telephone service 
to date our largest markets have been in asia  emea  and latin america  with our largest customers located in india and venezuela 
we ended the year with a total of customers in countries 
history we were founded in july in late we began performing original design manufacturing and product engineering and development for major international telecommunications companies 
in december  we acquired entatel  ltd  a south korean company  in order to meet the engineering requirements of these projects  and changed its name to axesstel r d center co  ltd 
this name was later changed to axesstel korea inc and continues as our operating research and development subsidiary located in korea 
our primary business in was focused on contract research and development and we engaged in only limited manufacturing and product sales on behalf of third parties 
in late and early  we believed that changing market factors would result in increasing demand for fixed wireless phones 
in response  we refocused our business to concentrate exclusively on developing  manufacturing and selling our own branded and co branded fixed wireless products 

table of contents in the first quarter of  we commenced large scale product manufacturing with our taiwan based manufacturing partner  wistron neweb corporation  or wnc 
in the third quarter of  wnc transitioned our production lines from taiwan to mainland china to take advantage of lower production costs and better access to the china supply chain 
wnc presently has two high speed production lines dedicated to high volume production  and the ability to add additional lines to match future capacity needs 
we continue to work with wnc in sourcing components for our products in an effort to reduce costs  ensure the quality of the components we purchase and mitigate against the risk that components are not available at the time we need the components to fulfill our customer orders 
we believe wnc provides flexibility and scalability to our manufacturing operations 
recent developments we began with four key strategic goals stabilize revenues through customer and product diversity  increase sales through localized sales teams  expand our offerings of higher margin data products  and achieve operating profitability 
we continued our efforts to diversify our customer base in we were successful in ending the year with customers in countries  and our customer base continues to expand 
our efforts to localize sales in emea produced significant results with revenues from that region increasing from million in to million in we continued to experience strong sales in latin america with revenues for that region of million in and million in in addition  we experienced continued growth in our revenue from data products 
revenues from data products increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  data products increased from in to in despite these efforts  we faced several operating challenges in we continue to experience significant customer concentration where two or three customers account for the majority of our sales in any period 
while sales in emea and latin america were solid  sales to asia were substantially below our expectations  declining from million in to million in customers in that region continue to be price sensitive  with average selling prices and potential profit margins decreasing substantially each year 
during  we were more conservative in our pricing  electing not to pursue bids where we did not see the opportunity for reasonable gross margins 
we began with strong revenue in the first and second quarter of million and million  respectively 
however  third quarter revenue fell to million primarily due to the decline in sales to customers in asia 
two additional factors severely impacted our operations in the third and fourth quarters  as follows first  the venezuelan government acquired control of that country s telephone infrastructure in january in and continuing in  venezuela was our largest market 
the transition did not have a substantial impact on orders 
we continued to receive orders from our large customers in venezuela 
however  payments out of venezuela were delayed on orders that we shipped in the first and second quarter 
those orders were made on open account terms and were not secured by a letter of credit or credit insurance 
as a result  we were not able to finance those receivables and the delay in payment had a substantial impact on our working capital 
second  we had engaged an investment banking firm to review potential acquisition candidates with proprietary technology and a data product portfolio 
in the second quarter  we identified an acquisition target  and began negotiations for the acquisition 
at the same time  we entered into negotiations on a financing that would provide capital for the acquisition and working capital for the combined operations 
the working capital shortfall in the 
table of contents third quarter increased the amount of capital necessary to complete and finance the acquisition 
ultimately  we were not able to complete the acquisition  or the related financing 
entering into the fourth quarter we again had substantial orders for products 
however  as a result of our working capital shortfall  increased by the expenses of the unsuccessful acquisition and financing  we were substantially behind in payments to our contract manufacturers 
wnc  our principal manufacturer  delayed delivery of products to us  and consequently to our customers  in the fourth quarter until we made substantial payments on our account with them 
they also stopped purchasing long lead time inventory to manufacture our products 
we established a payment plan with wnc 
in december we collected most of our receivables from venezuela allowing us to make substantial payments to wnc  but the shipment and purchasing delays impacted revenues for the quarter  which fell to million 
we ended the year with revenues of million and a backlog of million 
outlook as we enter  we will continue our focus on our core strategic goals customer diversity is critical to mitigating the risk of quarter to quarter volatility 
we will continue to diversify our customer base and add new accounts 
the addition of our gsm product line is opening new markets  particularly in central and south america  where operators are predominantly on the gsm standard 
we are also looking to supply our current customers with higher end data products as they roll out upgrades to their network infrastructure 
our regional sales strategy has been successful in emea and we expect to continue that strategy 
we are looking at establishing additional sales offices in that region 
we have also placed a regional sales manager in asia in an effort to increase sales in that region 
we expect to launch over a dozen new products in in mid february at the gsm mobile world congress  we introduced five newly redesigned gsm products  including dual band and quad band phones and terminals  which are available for purchase 
these include basic models that deliver reliable  low cost solutions  cordless models which appeal to the growing number of consumers looking for a more convenient product  and our quad band models which enable operators to buy one solution and use it in all of their gsm markets or redirect inventory as appropriate 
we will be introducing advanced evdo hi speed data phones 
we are expanding our broadband data lines to include edge  hsdpa and hsupa modems  which we anticipate will be available in the second half of we are addressing operating profitability in from both the revenue and expense side 
on the revenue side  based on current backlog and anticipated growth in the wireless markets we serve  we expect revenues to return to  and exceed the levels reached in and the migration to higher margin data products is expected to accelerate  increasing gross margin 
finally at the end of we took a number of measures to reduce our operating expenses 
we transitioned research and development of our lower margin phones to an outsourced design and manufacturing model 
that is allowing us to reduce our internal engineering and support resources as well as lease expenses 
we expect these changes to reduce operating expenses in by approximately million 
increasing our working capital will also be a key goal for although we collected a substantial portion of our accounts receivable in the last weeks of  the operating loss for the year has reduced our working capital position 
at the outset of  we entered into a distributor agreement that will enable us to secure financing on our orders to venezuela 
we have also established new working capital lines of credit with wells fargo that will allow us to borrow against backed letters of credit and credit insured accounts receivable 
we expect these facilities  along with the reduction in operating expenses described above  to provide sufficient working capital to continue operations in accordance with our current business plan 
however  we do not have sufficient working capital resources to offset extraordinary expenses or a substantial decline in operating income 

table of contents for that reason we do anticipate seeking additional debt or equity financing during see liquidity and capital resources below 
overall  we expect revenue in to exceed million  up from million in we expect data products will contribute more than million in revenues in  up from million in  and to exceed phone revenues for the first time on an annualized basis 
we continue to strive towards profitability based on an increase in revenues  adjustment in product mix  and streamlining of operating expenses that was implemented at the end of although we realize profitability is highly dependent on product and customer mix  and anticipate we may not be profitable every quarter  we are committed to achieving profitability for the year 
revenues our product portfolio consists of fixed wireless products in five categories desktop phones  pco phones  voice data terminals  broadband modems  and g gateway devices 
we believe that an increasing portion of our anticipated growth will come from sales of our next generation data products  such as our fixed wireless broadband modem and g gateway devices  into developing and industrialized countries as demand grows for broadband data services 
we sell our products to telecommunications service providers on a fixed price per unit basis 
our customers in turn resell our products to end users as part of the end users service activation 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from three customers  whose orders represented  and of revenues  respectively 
all of our sales are based on purchase orders or other short term arrangements 
we negotiate the pricing of our products based on the quantity and the length of the time for which deliveries are to be made 
for orders involving a significant number of units  or which involve deliveries over a long period of time  we typically receive rolling forecasts or a predetermined quantity for a fixed period of time from our customers  which in turn allows us to forecast internal volume and component requirements for manufacturing 
in order to minimize our collection risks  we attempt to sell to our international customers under guaranteed letters of credit or open terms secured by credit insurance 
at times  we extend credit based on evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
to date  substantially all of our product sales have been to customers outside of the united states 
in order to minimize foreign exchange risk  we have made all sales to date in us dollars 
we supply our principal manufacturer wnc with rolling forecasts 
in addition  we receive forecasts from our customers  and in turn  place orders with wnc for near term production 
based upon our purchase orders and forecasts  wnc procures components in amounts intended to meet the near term demand 
following receipt of our orders  wnc generally manufactures our products and delivers the finished goods to the customer s freight forwarder in china  transferring title at that point 
we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to the freight forwarder 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of direct materials  manufacturing expense  freight expense  warranty expense  and royalty fees 
pricing for fixed wireless products has declined since we ve entered into this business 
we believe our ability to increase sales of our products and achieve profitability will depend in part on our ability to reduce cost of goods sold 
we continue our cost reduction efforts through the following initiatives increasing our purchasing power through increased volume  ordering standardized parts used across our product lines  looking for additional manufacturing partners in low cost regions  reengineering our products with new technologies and expertise to decrease the number of components  relying more on application and software development than hardware  and improving our manufacturing processes 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  facility expenses  employee travel  fees for outside service providers  test fees and depreciation of developmental test equipment 
the majority of this activity is for software  mechanical and hardware product development 
we are increasingly focusing our research and development on data products  seeking areas where product differentiation will provide value to our customers and provide protection on pricing 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive and operational management  finance  human resources  information technology  sales and marketing  program management and administrative personnel 
other costs include facility expenses  employee travel  bank and financing fees  insurance  legal expense  commissions  accounting  professional service providers  board of director expense  stockholder relations  amortization of intangible assets  and depreciation expense of software and other fixed assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in consultation with our board of directors  we have identified the following accounting policies that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements 
these accounting policies require management s subjective judgments 
revenue recognition and warranty reserve revenues from product sales are recognized when the risks of ownership and title are transferred to the customer as specified in the respective sales agreements and other revenue recognition criterion as prescribed by staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
generally  the risks of ownership and title pass when product is received by the customer s freight forwarder 
if and when products are returned  we normally exchange them or provide credits to the customer 
the returned products in turn are shipped back to the third party manufacturer and we are issued a credit or exchange from the manufacturer 
at december   management concluded that no sales return allowance was needed 
on certain contracts  we provide warranty replacement units ranging from percent of total units shipped 
the cost related to the warranty replacement unit is included in the cost of goods sold and recorded when revenue is recognized 
on other contracts  we do not provide warranty replacement units 
in these cases  we provide third party service centers to the customer for any warranty performance 
costs for these service centers are recorded to cost of goods sold 
during the year ended december   warranty costs amounted to approximately  and  as of december   we established a warranty reserve of  to cover additional service costs over the life of the warranty 
all products are tested by quality inspection prior to shipment and we have historically experienced a minimum level of defective units 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowance we extend credit based on evaluation of the customer s financial condition and payment history 
at times  obligations for our foreign customers are secured either by letters of credit or by credit insurance 
significant management judgment is required to determine the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical write off percentages and information 
table of contents collected from individual customers 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectibility is determined to be permanently impaired 
at december   management determined that an allowance of  was necessary 
capitalized software costs software development costs for products sold  which consist primarily of firmware embedded in our products  incurred after technological feasibility is established are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
amortization of these costs begins when the products are ready for sale 
sfas no 
and other authoritative literature  interpretations and industry practices prescribe that technological feasibility is reached when both the software and other components of the product s research and development activities are completed 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon attainment of both requirements 
our engineering processes demonstrate that the research and development activities of our products are completed simultaneously with the commencement of the manufacturing process 
as such  we expense all research and development activities performed up to the commencement of the manufacturing process 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
during the year ended december   we determined that our goodwill was impaired and wrote off the carrying value of approximately  management concluded that no other long lived assets were impaired 
our intangible assets consist mainly of our license fee agreements  which we amortize over a three to ten year life 
deferred tax assets we periodically and at least annually evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax assets  taking into consideration prior earnings history  actual revenue and operations  projected operating results and the reversal of temporary differences 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  sfas r which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the 
table of contents grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  for periods beginning january  in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statements of operations data and the percentages of total revenues thereto 
year ended december  in thousands revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of assets total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  general we finished with revenues of million and a net loss of million 
revenues were strong in the first two quarters of the year  amounting to million and million  respectively 
however orders fell during the third quarter  due in substantial part to a decline in sales to asia  and revenues for the period dropped to million 
working capital and manufacturing issues  discussed below  impacted fourth quarter revenues which dropped to million 
in addition to the decline in orders for the third quarter  two additional factors impacted our operations for the second half of the year 
first  payments out of venezuela were delayed on orders that we shipped in the first and second quarter 
those orders were made on open account terms  they were not secured by a letter of credit or credit insurance 
as a result  we were not able to finance those receivables and the delay in payment had a substantial impact on our working capital 
second  in the second quarter we identified an acquisition target  and 
table of contents began negotiations for the acquisition of a company in the machine to machine data space 
at the same time  we entered into negotiation on a financing that would provide capital for the acquisition and working capital for the combined operations 
the working capital shortfall in the third quarter increased the amount of capital necessary to complete and finance the acquisition 
ultimately  we were not able to complete the acquisition  or the related financing 
costs incurred in connection with the failed acquisition and financing were expensed in the third quarter 
in order to augment our working capital  we entered into a financing arrangement in the third quarter to finance certain of our accounts receivable in venezuela 
those accounts receivables and the financing facility were repaid in the fourth quarter and all interest and related charges incurred in connection with that financing recognized at that time 
in connection with our strategic shift to focus internal research and development on higher margin data products  we initiated outsourced design and manufacturing operations for certain of our lower end phone products 
in the fourth quarter  we restructured some of our engineering and administrative resources  reducing operating expenses 
we also experienced a management change which resulted in severance expense 
the costs associated with the reduction in headcount and change in management were expensed in the fourth quarter 
revenues for the year ended december   revenues were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease 
in  our revenues were derived principally from three customers  which together represented of revenues  and individually represented   and of revenues  respectively 
in  our revenues were derived principally from three customers  which together represented of revenues  and individually represented   and of revenues  respectively 
our revenues for the year ended december  consisted of for phone products  for terminal products and for broadband modem products 
for the year ended december   our revenues consisted of for phone products  for terminal products and for broadband modem products 
although phone revenue decreased significantly in  revenues increased substantially for broadband modem products 
our objective is to expand our product portfolio for broadband modem products in  as well as to expand our customer base to reach new customers and new regions 
we continue to expect that most of our sales will be to foreign customers or for products to be used in foreign countries 
as we grow  we expect to become less dependent on a limited concentration of customers 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the decrease to cost of goods sold reflects the decrease in revenues in the comparable periods  and the product mix shift from modem revenue content in to modem revenue content in  as we typically experience higher average selling prices on our data product line 
our cost of materials declined on a per unit basis in as we were able to re engineer our products to take advantage of cost efficient alternate parts  and reduce prices with our suppliers 
in and continuing into  most of our products were manufactured by one vendor 
we continue to work toward reduced manufacturing costs on a unit basis 
we anticipate that our vendor will be able to further decrease its costs as our purchase volume increases 
we are also evaluating additional manufacturing vendors and other vendors to produce specific hardware and other components used in the manufacturing process in an effort to further reduce cost of goods sold 
gross margin for the year ended december   gross margin as a percentage of revenues was compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin percentages increase was mainly the result of favorable 
table of contents product mix from our data products during the comparative periods  as we typically experience higher margins from our data products than from our phone products 
we expect demand for our data products to remain strong in  and expect the annual gross margins as a percentage of revenue to remain in the low twenties 
however  margins may fluctuate on an individual quarterly basis due to customer and product mix  as well as other factors 
research and development for the year ended december   research and development expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was mainly attributable to increases in outside certification test fees and outside development of prototype products in the development of both our phone and data products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development for the year ended december  were compared to in the year ended december  we are presently spending much of our research and development funds on the development of our next generation data products 
in addition  significant modifications to current products are required for each customer and each geographical location where the end user is located 
as we continue the development focus for our data products  we will enact cost reduction programs to lower the cost in the development of our phone products  including a strategy to outsource most of the future development for these products 
we expect our expenditures to increase for the development of our data products in  but be offset by cost reductions in the development of our phone products 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenditures to remain stable for  but to reduce as a percent of revenue in selling  general and administrative for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was mainly due to the increase of internal external sales commissions of approximately million  increases of legal and professional fees associated with financings and a failed acquisition attempt of million  and the increase of other operating expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administration expenses increased to in from in at the end of we increased our focus on outsource design and manufacturing for certain of our products 
we also reduced headcount in certain areas 
however  severance and termination costs offset any savings from the reduction in staff 
looking to  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase with the anticipated increase in revenues  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
impairment of assets for the year ended december   an impairment charge of approximately  million was charged to operating expenses related to goodwill from december acquisition of entatel 
for the year ended december   an impairment charge of million was charged to operating expenses related to production equipment from our closed down manufacturing operations in korea 
other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense was a net expense of approximately  this amount included interest and other income of million  offset by approximately million of interest and other expense associated from debt and financing activities 
the majority of the million other income benefit was derived from the amendment of a license agreement that reversed a license fee amortization previously recorded of million 
for the year ended december   other income expense was a net benefit of approximately  this amount included interest and other income of million  offset by 
table of contents approximately  of expense associated from debt and financing activities 
the majority of the million other income benefit was derived from the sale of  shares of ubistar common stock  formerly known as axess telecom  an unrelated third party 
the  shares of ubistar common stock were acquired as part of a litigation settlement in in  we expect interest and other expenses to be similar to the amount experienced in based on expected debt levels 
provision for income taxes for both and  no income tax provisions were recorded 
currently  we do not record tax benefits against net losses since we have established a full reserve against all deferred tax assets 
in addition  according to internal revenue code regulations  we were deemed in october and march to have experienced two changes in ownership during these years 
these changes in ownership limit the use of our net operating loss carry forward to a specific amount each year 
we may in the future experience further ownership change events  which would similarly limit use of any net operating loss carry forwards that might otherwise be available subsequent to the date of the most recent ownership changes 
net loss for the year ended december   net loss was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  general we established record revenues of million in based on strong revenue growth in the second half of the year 
we entered with a declining revenue base due to reduced phone sales in our asia market that originated in the second half of this decline continued in the first quarter of  as revenues decreased to million 
starting in the second quarter of  revenues rebounded due to improved customer and product diversification 
we established record revenues in latin america and from our data products  and recorded revenues of million  million  and million in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the increased revenues from our data products has led to record product gross margins of percent in the third quarter of  percent in the fourth quarter and percent overall for the revenue growth in the second half of combined with the data product mix additionally led to profitability in the second half of revenues for the year ended december   revenues were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a increase 
in  our revenues were derived principally from three customers  which together represented of revenues  and individually represented   and of revenues  respectively  in in  our revenues were derived principally from two customers  which together represented of revenues and individually represented and of revenues  respectively  in our revenues for the year ended december  consisted of for phone products  for terminal products and for broadband modem products 
for the year ended december   our revenues consisted of for phone products  for terminal products and for broadband modem products 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the decrease reflects the product mix shift from modem revenue content in to modem revenue content in  as we typically experience higher average 
table of contents selling prices on our data product line 
our cost of materials declined on a per unit basis in as we were able to re engineer our products to take advantage of cost efficient alternate parts  and reduce prices with our suppliers 
in and continuing into  most of our products were manufactured by one vendor wnc 
we continue to work toward reduced manufacturing costs on a unit basis 
we anticipate that our vendor will be able to further decrease its costs to us due to its transition from taiwan to china  and as our purchase volume increases 
we are also evaluating additional manufacturing vendors and other vendors to produce specific hardware and other components used in the manufacturing process in an effort to further reduce cost of goods sold 
gross margin for the year ended december   gross margin as a percentage of revenues was compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin percentages increase was mainly the result of favorable product mix from our data products during the comparative periods  as we typically experience higher margins from our data products than from our phone products

in addition  significant modifications to current products are required for each customer and each geographical location where the end user is located 
selling  general and administrative for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to external sales commissions of million in compared to external sales commissions of approximately  in the majority of these commissions were in connection with revenues from latin america 
other increases were primarily attributed to increases in wages and benefits of approximately  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administration expenses for were compared to in as our revenues increase  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to grow and build our infrastructure  but decrease as a percentage of revenues 
impairment of assets for the year ended december   an impairment charge of million was charged to operating expenses related to production equipment from our closed down manufacturing operations in korea 
other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense was a net benefit of approximately  this amount included interest and other income of million  offset by approximately  of expense associated from debt and financing activities 
the majority of the million other income benefit was derived from the sale of  shares of ubistar common stock  formerly known as axess telecom  an unrelated third party

this expense included prepayment penalties of approximately  and the expensing of approximately  for finder fees  note payable discounts  and interest 

table of contents in an increasing portion of our sales were made on credit terms 
we established a working capital facility of up to million with silicon valley bank 
we expect interest expenses to increase in based on our current debt levels 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   an income tax provision of zero was recorded compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the income tax provision in reflected a write off of a previously established tax asset 
we no longer record tax benefits against net losses and have established a full reserve against all deferred tax assets 
in addition  according to internal revenue code regulations  we were deemed in october and march to have experienced two changes in ownership during the past three years 
these changes in ownership limit the use of our net operating loss carry forward to a specific amount each year 
we may in the future experience further ownership change events  which would similarly limit use of any net operating loss carry forwards that might otherwise be available subsequent to the date of the most recent ownership changes 
net loss for the year ended december   net loss was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of  compared to million at december  in addition  at december   accounts receivable were million  compared to million at december  at december   we had negative working capital of million compared to working capital of at december  for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations which was derived from the cash net loss of approximately million net loss offset by non cash adjustments for the write off of stock based compensation  discount on a note  asset impairment  receivable and inventory provisions  and depreciation and amortization and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
investment activities used approximately  of cash during the year ended december   primarily for the acquisition of software and equipment offset by payments made on a note receivable 
as of december   we do not have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
during the year ended december   cash used by financing activities amounted to million  as we repaid million of bank financing from december   and received new bank financing of  we have experienced losses from operations since the proceeds from our secondary public offering provided the working capital necessary to fund the operating losses 
we also structured our supply and customer relationships to minimize our working capital requirements 
under the terms of our manufacturing agreements  our contract manufacturers acquire components and manufacture finished goods to our specifications  minimizing our investment in inventory 
where possible we require our customers to provide a letter of credit to secure their purchase orders 
we then financed those accounts receivables through commercial banking arrangements 
commencing in our sales shifted from predominantly asian countries  where commercial practices use letters of credit  to latin american countries  where standard commercial terms are open accounts 
our largest account in was a customer in venezuela  which does not provide letters of credit and for which we could not obtain credit insurance or secure accounts receivable financing 
selling product on open account increases our working capital requirements as we may be called upon to pay our manufacturers before we receive payment 
table of contents from our customers 
this problem was compounded when the venezuelan government s exchange control arm  cadivi  substantially delayed payments in the delay in payment caused us to fall behind in payments to our contract manufacturer 
by the end of the third quarter wnc our primary contract manufacturer began withholding shipments and stopped ordering long lead time parts 
in october  we entered into an agreement with centurion capital  pursuant to which we borrowed million from centurion secured by certain of our accounts receivable in venezuela 
we subsequently collected the accounts receivable and repaid the centurion promissory note in since the beginning of the year in  we have entered into several arrangements to address our working capital needs in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with brightstar corporation to sell our products in venezuela 
under the terms of the distribution agreement our customers submit their purchase orders to brightstar 
brightstar then submits a purchase order to us  secured by a letter of credit 
we can secure accounts receivable financing for the account receivable to brightstar 
brightstar assumes the credit risk of the customer in venezuela 
under this arrangement brightstar receives a commission for accommodating the sale 
this arrangement allows us to secure commercial financing for the receivable that covers product being sold to venezuela 
we also entered into a loan transaction with brightstar  we borrowed million from brightstar pursuant to the terms of a promissory note dated january  our repayment obligations under the promissory note are secured by certain of our accounts receivable from customers in venezuela 
the promissory note bears interest at a rate of percent per month subject to a minimum of interest 
repayment of principal is due on the earlier of collection of the accounts receivable that secure the note  or one year from the date of issuance 
the proceeds of the note were used to make payment to wnc on our delinquent account with the contract manufacturer 
in january  we entered into two new commercial credit agreements with affiliates of wells fargo bank 
one of the credit arrangements provides working capital financing for our accounts receivable which are secured by credit insurance 
the other provides working capital financing for our accounts receivable which are secured by letters of credit 
currently  our working capital is derived from operations 
our only sources of borrowing are our lines of credit with wells fargo bank  which are secured by that portion of our accounts receivable which are either credit insured or secured by a letter of credit 
we intend to use this working capital financing to continue to fulfill orders for our products 
for our gross margin from product sales was of revenues 
we anticipate that gross margin will be in the low twenties for accordingly we are currently relying on gross margin from increased product sales to cover our operating expenses 
if we fail to generate sufficient product sales we will not generate sufficient gross margin to cover our operating expenses 
we intend to secure additional working capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
no arrangements or commitments for any such financing are in place at this time  and we cannot give any assurances about the availability or terms of any future financing 
because of our continuing net losses and our negative working capital position  our independent auditors  in their report on our financial statements for the year ended december  expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
