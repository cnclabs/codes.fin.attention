item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described under the caption risk factors beginning on page these factors could cause our actual results in current and future periods to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  those forward looking statements 
overview the company is a multinational specialty property and casualty insurer focused on generating consistent underwriting profits 
we provide insurance coverage for small businesses and products with high volumes of insureds and loss profiles which we believe are predictable 
we target lines of insurance that we believe generally are underserved by larger insurance carriers 
the company has grown by hiring teams of underwriters with expertise in our specialty lines and through acquisitions of access to distribution networks and renewal rights to established books of specialty insurance business 
we have operations in three business segments workers compensation for small businesses average premium less than  per policy in the united states  specialty risk and extended warranty coverage for consumer and commercial goods and custom designed coverages  such as accidental damage plans and payment protection plans offered in connection with the sale of consumer and commercial goods  in the united kingdom  certain other european union countries and the united states  and specialty middle market property and casualty insurance 
we write commercial insurance for homogeneous  narrowly defined classes of insureds  requiring an in depth knowledge of the insured s industry segment  through general and other wholesale agents 
the company transacts business through seven insurance company subsidiaries technology insurance company  inc tic  rochdale insurance company ric  wesco insurance company wic or wesco and associated industries insurance company  inc aiic  which are domiciled in new hampshire  new york  delaware and florida  respectively  and amtrust international insurance ltd 
aii  amtrust international underwriters limited aiu and igi insurance company  ltd 
igi  which are domiciled in bermuda  ireland and england  respectively 
our consolidated results include the results for our holding company and our wholly owned subsidiaries which principally include tic  which underwrites workers compensation insurance  specialty risk insurance and extended warranty coverage  and specialty middle market property and casualty coverages in the united states  ric  which underwrites workers compensation insurance  specialty risk and extended warranty coverage  and specialty middle market property and casualty coverages in the united states  wic  which underwrites workers compensation insurance  specialty risk insurance and extended warranty coverage  and specialty middle market property and casualty coverages in the united states  aiu  which underwrites specialty risk and extended warranty coverage plans in the european union  aiic  which underwrites workers compensation insurance in the southeastern united states  igi  which underwrites specialty risk and extended warranty coverage in the european union  and aii  which reinsures the underwriting activities of tic  ric  aiic  igi and aiu 
insurance  particularly workers compensation  is  generally  affected by seasonality 
the first quarter generally produces greater premiums than subsequent quarters 
nevertheless  the impact of seasonality on our 
table of contents small business workers compensation and specialty middle market segments has not been significant 
we believe that this is because we serve many small businesses in different geographic locations 
in addition  we believe seasonality may have been muted by our acquisition activity 
one of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance is return on average equity 
our return on average equity was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our overall financial objective is to produce a return on average equity of or more over the long term 
in addition  we target a net combined ratio of or lower over the long term  while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our am best rating objectives 
our net combined ratio was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a key factor in achieving our targeted net combined ratio is improvement of our net expense ratio 
our strategy across our segments is to maintain premium rates  deploy capital judiciously  manage our expenses and focus on the sectors in which we have expertise  which we believe will provide opportunities for greater returns 
investment income is an important part of our business 
because the period of time between our receipt of premiums and the ultimate settlement of claims is often several years or longer  we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time 
as a result  we are able to generate more investment income from our premiums as compared to insurance companies that operate in many other lines of business 
our net investment income including finance income of afs capital corporation prior to its disposition in april was million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
as of december   the company held of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents 
this relatively high concentration of cash and cash equivalents represents our reaction to the relatively flat debt yield curve and should enable the company to quickly redeploy substantial assets should the interest rate environment change 
our most significant balance sheet liability is our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors 
our loss reserves are reviewed at least annually by our external actuaries 
reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces  principally frequency and severity of future claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  inflation of medical costs and wages  insurance policy coverage interpretations  jury determinations and legislative changes 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our estimates  these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made  with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings 
the use of reinsurance is an important component of our business strategy 
see business reinsurance 
as losses are incurred and recorded  we record amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers for the portion of the paid and unpaid losses ceded to the reinsurers 
we have purchased reinsurance for our small business workers compensation segment  which also reinsures the workers compensation portion of the specialty middle market property and casualty business we recently acquired 
we purchased reinsurance to cover the property portion of this business 
at present  we do not plan to reinsure the general liability and auto liability portions of this business 
recent developments in december  we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire the unitrin business insurance unit ubi of unitrin  inc ubi conducts business in states with geographic emphasis in the south  northwest and midwest and had total premium revenues of approximately million in the purchase price is million plus an amount equal to the combined statutory surplus of the entities which we will acquire as part of the acquisition 
as of december   the combined statutory surplus of the 
table of contents ubi entities was approximately million 
the transaction is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of the purchase is contingent on obtaining customary regulatory approvals 
in november  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to three million shares of common stock in one or more transactions at prevailing prices in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
management plans to utilize the authority at such times and to the extent that management determines it is in the best interests of the company 
the company repurchased  shares during related to this authorization 
reinsurance agreement with maiden during the third quarter of  the company and maiden holdings  inc maiden entered into master agreement  as amended  by which they caused the company s bermuda affiliate  amtrust international insurance  ltd 
aii and maiden insurance to enter into a quota share reinsurance agreement the reinsurance agreement by which a aii retrocedes to maiden insurance an amount equal to of the premium written by amtrust s us  irish and us insurance companies the amtrust ceding insurers  net of the cost of unaffiliated inuring reinsurance and in the case of amtrust s uk insurance subsidiary  igi insurance company limited igi  net of commissions and of losses and b aii transferred to maiden insurance of the amtrust ceding insurer s unearned premium reserves  effective as of july   with respect to current lines of business  excluding risks for which the amtrust ceding insurers net retention exceeds million covered business 
amtrust also has agreed to cause aii  subject to regulatory requirements  to reinsure any insurance company which writes covered business in which amtrust acquires a majority interest to the extent required to enable aii to cede to maiden insurance of the premiums and losses related to such covered business 
the agreement further provides that the aii receives a ceding commission of of ceded written premiums 
the reinsurance agreement has an initial term of three years and will automatically renew for successive three year terms thereafter  unless either aii or maiden insurance notifies the other of its election not to renew not less than nine months prior to the end of any such three year term 
in addition  either party is entitled to terminate on thirty day s notice or less upon the occurrence of certain early termination events  which include a default in payment  insolvency  change in control of aii or maiden insurance  run off  or a reduction of or more of the shareholders equity of maiden insurance or the combined shareholders equity of aii and the amtrust ceding insurers 
the company recorded approximately million of ceding commission during as a result of this transaction

the company recorded an investment loss of approximately million from its equity investment for as of december  the carrying value of the note receivable was million note receivable related party 
principal revenue and expense items gross premium written 
gross premium written represent estimated premiums from each insurance policy that we write  including as part of an assigned risk plan  during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy 
certain policies that are underwritten by the company are subject to premium audit at that policy s cancellation or expiration 
the final actual gross premiums written may vary from the original estimate based on changes to the final rating parameters or classifications of the policy 
net premium written 
net premium written are gross premiums written less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements 
the amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement 
net premium earned 
net premium earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written 
insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
at the end of each reporting period  premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
our workers compensation insurance policies typically have a term of one year 
thus  for a one year policy written on july  for an employer with a constant payroll during the term of the policy  we would earn half of the premiums in and the other half in our specialty risk and extended warranty coverages are earned over the estimated exposure time period 
the terms vary depending on the risk and have an average duration of approximately months  but range in duration from one month to months 
net investment income 
we invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities in fixed maturity and equity securities 
a portion of these funds are held in cash and cash equivalents 
our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets 
net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable 
net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable  or are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment 
we classify equity securities and most of our fixed maturity securities as available for sale and the remainder of our fixed maturity securities as held to maturity 
net unrealized gains losses on those securities classified as available for sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
commission and fee income 
we recognize commission and fee revenue as a servicing carrier for the georgia and virginia assigned risk plans 
in addition  we also offer claims adjusting and loss control services for fees to unaffiliated third parties 
we also recognize fee income associated with the issuance of workers compensation policies for installment fees  in jurisdictions where it is permitted and approved  and reinstatement fees  fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non payment  in jurisdictions where it is permitted and approved 
our specialty risk and extended warranty business generates fee revenue 
table of contents for product warranty registration and claims handling services provided to unaffiliated third parties 
we also recognize brokerage and asset management fees in association with our reinsurance agreement with maiden 
loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred represent our largest expense item and  for any given reporting period  include estimates of future claim payments  changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and servicing claims 
these expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure 
we record loss and loss adjustment expenses related to estimates of future claim payments based on case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience 
it is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of injured employees and claimants and the costs of their medical treatment 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability 
policy acquisition expenses 
policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents  wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf 
in most instances  commissions are paid based on collected premium  which reduces our credit risk exposure associated with producers in case a policyholder does not pay a premium 
we pay state and local taxes  licenses and fees  assessments and contributions to various state workers compensation guaranty funds based on our premiums or losses in each state 
surcharges that the company may be required to charge insureds in certain jurisdictions are considered accrued liabilities  rather than expense 
salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits expenses are those salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the origination  issuance and maintenance of policies  claims adjustment and accounting for insurance transactions 
salaries and benefits associated with employees that are involved in fee generating activities are classified as other expenses 
other insurance general and administrative expenses 
other insurance general and administrative expenses are comprised of other costs associated with the company s insurance activities such as federal excise tax  postage  telephones and internet access charges as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include those charges that are related to the non insurance fee generating activities in which the company engages  including salaries and benefits expenses and other charges directly attributable to non insurance fee generating activities 
interest expense 
interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then applicable interest rates 
income tax expense 
we incur federal income tax expense as well as income tax expense in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
net loss ratio 
the net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of net losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
net expense ratio 
the net expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of the sum of policy acquisition expenses  salaries and benefits  and other insurance general and administrative expenses less ceding commission to net premiums earned 
net combined ratio 
the net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit 
this is the sum of the net loss and net expense ratios 
if the net combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 

table of contents annualized return on equity 
return on equity is calculated by dividing net income net income excludes results of discontinued operations as well as any currency gain or loss associated with discontinued operations on an after tax basis by the average of shareholders equity 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
we consider some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates and assumptions used with the audit committee 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers  assessments  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  the impairment of investment securities  goodwill and other intangible assets and the valuation of stock based compensation 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we utilize a combination of the company s incurred loss development factors and industry wide incurred loss development factors 
our actuary generates a range within which it is reasonably likely that our ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses will fall 
the low end of the range is established by assigning a weight of to our ultimate losses obtained by application of the company s own loss development factors and to our ultimate losses developed through application of industry wide loss development factors 
the high end is established by assigning a weight of each to our ultimate losses as developed through application of company and industry wide loss development factors 
the determination to assign particular weights to ultimate losses developed through application of company loss development factors and industry wide loss development factors is made by our actuary and is a matter of actuarial judgment 
in connection with the generation of the range  we have not made any shifts in the relative weights assigned to ultimate losses developed through application of company and industry wide loss development factors 
however  in the selection of our reserves  the company  based on the increasing amount of its own historical data to rely upon  has given greater consideration to the results attributable to its own loss development factors 
nevertheless  we continue to record our reserves at the higher end of the range  above the midpoint  which we believe to be prudent in light of the uncertainty inherent in estimating reserves 
we believe this method  which tracks the development of claims incurred in a particular time period  is the best method for projecting our ultimate liability 
these factors are dependent on a number of elements  including frequency and severity of claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  projected inflation of medical costs and wages for workers compensation  insurance policy coverage interpretations  judicial determinations and existing laws and regulations 
the predictive ability of loss development factors is dependent on consistent underwriting  claims handling  and inflation  among other factors  and predictable legislatively and judicially imposed legal requirements 
if all things remain equal  losses incurred in should develop similarly to losses incurred in and prior years 
thus  if the net loss ratio for premiums written in year one is we expect that the net loss ratio for premiums written in year two also would be 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors  our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates 

table of contents notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty  the company has not experienced material variability in its loss development factors 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that we could experience a deviation in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves due to changes in the elements that underlie loss development  such as claims frequency or severity 
as of december   the average cost per claim was  which was a increase over the claims severity from of  in  claims frequency number of claims per million of payroll increased to from  an increase of  for the period between and in the event of a increase in claims frequency as measured by payroll  which we believe is the most important assumption regarding our business  the company s loss reserves as of december  would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
in the event of a increase in claim severity  which is the average incurred loss per claim  the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
on a quarterly basis  and in some cases more frequently  we review our reserves to determine whether they are consistent with our actual results 
in the event of a discrepancy  we would seek to determine the causes underwriting  claims  inflation  regulatory and would adjust our reserves accordingly 
for example  if the development of our total incurred losses were greater than the loss development factors would have predicted  we would adjust our reserves for the periods in question 
in  we recognized a million redundancy in prior year s reserves 
in  we recognized a million deficiency in the prior year s reserves 
in  we recognized a million deficiency in prior year s reserves  related to ncci pools 
we do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments  but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves 
additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in risk factors and business loss reserves 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers 
amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers represent the portion of our paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses that is assumed by such reinsurers 
we are required to pay claims even if a reinsurer fails to pay us under the terms of a reinsurance contract 
we calculate amounts recoverable from reinsurers based on our estimates of the underlying loss and loss adjustment expenses  as well as the terms and conditions of our reinsurance contracts  which could be subject to interpretation 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  which can be significant because some of the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for which we have reinsurance coverage remain outstanding for extended periods of time 
assessments related to insurance premiums 
we are subject to various assessments and premium surcharges related to our insurance activities  including assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds and second injury funds 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written 
assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year of when claims are paid by us 
state guaranty fund assessments are used by state insurance oversight agencies to pay claims of policyholders of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies and the operating expenses of those agencies 
second injury funds are used by states to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
in some states  these assessments and premium surcharges may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes 
premiums 
insurance premiums  other than specialty risk and extended warranty  are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the contract period 
insurance premiums on specialty risk and extended warranty are earned based on estimated program coverage periods 
these estimates are based on the expected distribution of coverage periods by contract at inception  because a single contract may contain multiple coverage period options and these estimates are revised based on the actual coverage periods selected by the insured 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired term of the contract or policy in force 
premium adjustments on contracts and audit premiums are based on estimates made over the contract period 
the company also estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of premium 
the company reviews its bad debt write offs at least annually and adjusts 
table of contents its premium percentage as required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
earned but unbilled premium 
earned but unbilled premium ebub estimates the amount of audit premium for those policies that have yet to be audited as of the date of the quarter or year end 
workers compensation policies are subject to audit and the final premium may increase or decrease materially from the original premium due to revisions to actual payroll and or employee classification 
as prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  paragraphs and as well as statement of statutory accounting principles ssap  the company determines ebub using statistically supported aggregate calculations based on the company s historical premium audit results 
the company has not had a material adjustment as a result of actual premium audits materially differing from the estimates used in calculating ebub 
as of december   if the actual results of the future premiums audits were lower than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be a decrease in ebub and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
if the actual results of the future premiums audits were higher than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be an increase in ebub  and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
in calculating ebub  the company considers its ability to collect the projected increased premium as well as those expenses associated with both the additional premium and return premium 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent the consideration we pay for the acquisition of access to distribution networks and renewal rights from certain third parties 
in such a transaction  we purchase the right  but not the obligation  to offer insurance coverage to a defined group of the seller s current policyholders when the current in force policies expire we do not acquire any in force policies as well as existing agency lists and certain operating platforms 
we record intangible assets based on minimum future consideration that is paid or to be paid to the seller as provided in the acquisition agreement with the seller 
in future periods if the minimum consideration is exceeded due to production incentive payments to the seller  the additional consideration will be recorded as goodwill 
additionally  when entering into a stock purchase agreement  we record distribution networks  trademarks  licenses and goodwill based on their fair value related to the acquired company 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful life 
intangible assets are evaluated periodically to ensure that there is no change required in the amortization period based on required accounting standards 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
the carrying amount is evaluated annually for impairment 
if there is an impairment to goodwill or intangible assets  we will recognize a reduction in intangible assets with a corresponding charge to expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commission expenses  premium taxes and assessments as well as certain marketing  sales  underwriting and safety costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance policies 
these acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense ratably as premiums are earned 
the company may realize deferred policy acquisition costs only if the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves calculated on a discounted basis to the premiums to be earned is less than  as it historically has been 
if  hypothetically  that ratio were to be above  the company could not continue to record deferred policy acquisition costs as an asset and may be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax asset primarily consists of the book versus tax differences for premiums earned  loss and loss adjustment expense reserve discounting  policy acquisition costs  earned but unbilled premiums  and unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities 
changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income  primarily unrealized investment gains and losses  are recorded directly to other comprehensive income 
otherwise  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce any 
table of contents portion of the deferred tax asset that is expected to more likely not be realized 
adjustments to the valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in management s assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that s realizable 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition issues 
under fin  the company recognizes tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the company s policy is to prospectively classify accrued interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits in its income tax provision 
at the date of adoption  the amount of interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheet was the company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
tax years through are still subject to examination 
the company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
stock compensation expense 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment and began recognizing compensation expense for its share based payments based on the fair value of the awards 
share based payments include restricted stock and stock option grants under the company s equity incentive plan 
sfas r requires share based compensation expense recognized since january   to be based on the following a grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date  and b grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r for unvested options granted subsequent to the adoption date 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of an investment security results in a reduction of the carrying value of the security and the realization of a loss when the fair value of the security declines below our cost or amortized cost  as applicable  for the security and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
the company s investment committee committee reviews quarterly for other than temporary impairment otti  whereby it evaluates each security which has an unrealized loss as of the end of each reporting period 
the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
some of the criteria we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  our intent and ability to keep the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments and the occurrence of discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy law

the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
some of the criteria we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  our intent and ability to keep the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency as well as an entire industry sector or sub sector  any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments and the occurrence of discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy law 
during  based on the criteria above  we determined that four equity securities were other than temporarily impaired and accordingly wrote them down resulting in a million realized loss 
at december   the company had million of gross unrealized losses related to marketable equity securities 
the company s investments in marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock across a wide range of sectors

the duration of these impairments ranges from one to months 
additionally  the company holds securities in a loss position of approximately million which are not considered individually significant 
the duration of impairment on these marketable securities is primarily less than months 
at december   the company held fixed maturity issues with a net unrealized loss position  which included fixed maturities with an unrealized loss greater than months and fixed maturities with an unrealized loss less than months 
the unrealized loss is attributable to the credit crunch that had developed in the third quarter of and kept on deteriorating 
this condition caused credit spreads to widen significantly  especially when it concerns borrowers relatively more involved in the financial market 
unrealized losses in bank and financial issues increased due to concerned about sub prime mortgage market and widening corporate spreads 
spreads on year a rated financials increased from at year end to at year end corporate bonds represent of the fair value of our fixed maturities and of our total unrealized losses of our fixed maturities 
the company owns corporate bonds in the industrial  bank financial and other sectors  which have a fair value of approximately percent  percent  and  respectfully  and  and of total unrealized losses of our fixed maturities 
the company expects the spreads to narrow again as the economic situation is improved and the market price for these securities recovers 
based on the company s ability and intent to hold these investments for a sufficient time for recovery of fair value  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed maturity and equity securities as of december

we have obtained reinsurance for this line of business with higher limits as our exposures have increased 
as the scale of our workers compensation business has increased  we have also increased the amount of risk we retain 
since january   we have maintained quota share reinsurance for our extended warranty and accidental damage insurance underwritten in the european union and certain coverage plans underwritten in the united states 
this reinsurance also covers certain other risks we underwrite in the european union 
under these quota share reinsurance arrangements  we cede a portion for the majority of the risks of each reinsured risk to our reinsurers and recover the same percentage of ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses  subject to certain exclusions and restrictions 
in return for this reinsurance protection  we pay the reinsurers their pro rata shares of the insurance premiums on the ceded business  less a ceding or overriding commission 
for the most part  coverage for losses arising out of acts of terrorism is excluded from this reinsurance 
the majority of our extended warranty and accidental damage insurance underwritten in the united states is not reinsured with third party reinsurers 

table of contents the following table summarizes the ten reinsurers that account for approximately of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities as to a time certain 
our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policy 
as a result  our calculation of loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of loss and loss adjustment expenses generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our loss and loss adjustment expense estimate process  see business loss reserves 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the table above to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors risks related to our business our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we are subject to various annual assessments imposed by certain of the states in which we write insurance policies 
these assessments are generally based upon the amount of premiums written or losses paid during the applicable year 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written  while assessments based on losses are generally paid 
table of contents within one year after the loss is paid 
when we establish a reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses for a reported claim  we accrue our obligation to pay any applicable assessments 
if settlement of the claim is to be paid out over more than one year  our obligation to pay any related loss based assessments extends for the same period of time 
because our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates  our accruals for loss based insurance assessments are also based on estimates 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ  perhaps materially  from our reserves 
accordingly  our actual loss based insurance assessments may vary  perhaps materially  from our accruals 
we are required by the terms of certain purchase agreements to pay the seller an annual minimum override payment based on a contractually defined formula 
the amount payable to the seller under these agreements could be materially higher if the premiums produced generate a higher payment than the calculated minimum payment 
additionally  the company is holding approximately million of the purchase price  which will be distributed upon resolution of a pending tax matter 
inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts 
we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation 
inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated  which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including salaries and benefits  generally are impacted by inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
liquidity risk 
liquidity risk represents the potential inability of amtrust to meet all payment obligations when they become due 
the company maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations 
we purchase reinsurance coverage to mitigate the liquidity risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed maturity securities and the financial condition of our third party reinsurers 
we address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated bbb or higher by standard poor s 
we also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed maturity securities 
to limit our risk exposure  we employ diversification policies that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded 
as a result  reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers which have an am best rating of a excellent or better at the time we enter into the agreement and by performing  along with our reinsurance broker  periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers 
if one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade  we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment  including commutation  novation and letters of credit 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity securities excluding million of time and short term deposits with a fair value of million and a carrying value of million as of december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed maturity securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset and liability 
table of contents matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of december  to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  and the associated pre tax impact on our shareholders equity 
because we anticipate that the company will continue to meet its obligations out of income  we classify our fixed maturity securities  other than redeemable preferred stock  mortgage backed and corporate obligations as held to maturity and carry them on our balance sheet at cost or amortized cost  as applicable 
any redeemable preferred stock we hold from time to time is classified as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held to maturity  such as those resulting from interest rate fluctuations  do not impact the carrying value of these securities and  therefore  do not affect our shareholders equity 
however  temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held as available for sale do impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities and on our shareholders equity  each as of december

we write insurance in the united kingdom and certain other european union member countries through aiu and igi 
while the functional currency of aiu and igi is the euro and british pound sterling  respectively  we write coverages that are settled in local currencies 
we attempt to maintain sufficient local currency assets on deposit to minimize our exposure to realized currency losses 
assuming a increase in the exchange rate of the local currency in which the claims will be paid and that we do not hold that local currency we would recognize a million after tax realized currency loss based on our outstanding foreign denominated reserves of million at december  
table of contents equity price risk 
equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio  which include common stocks  non redeemable preferred stocks and master limited partnerships 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets and a decrease in our shareholders equity 
as of december   the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of million  representing approximately of our total invested assets on that date 
we are fundamental long buyers and short sellers  with a focus on value oriented stocks 
the table below illustrates the impact on our equity portfolio and financial position given a hypothetical movement in the broader equity markets 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the carrying value of our equity portfolio and on shareholders equity as of december  the hypothetical scenarios below assume that the company s beta is when compared to the s p index
