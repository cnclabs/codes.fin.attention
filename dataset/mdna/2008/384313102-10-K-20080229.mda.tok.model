table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we have four major product categories graphite electrodes  advanced graphite materials  carbon refractories  and natural graphite 
reportable segments 
our businesses are reported in the following categories graphite electrode  which primarily serves the steel industry and includes graphite electrode product operations and related services 
advanced graphite materials  which includes primary and specialty products and related services for the transportation  solar  oil and gas  and other markets 
other businesses  which includes natural graphite products and refractories 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
and overall  global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in and we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in and billion metric tons in  about an and increase  respectively  over the prior year 
in  china s steel production grew almost  a faster rate than the worldwide market  and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
in  china s production grew almost and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production was approximately basic oxygen furnace related for both and however  china also was the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity grew  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
this contributed to a favorable global pricing environment in and demand for our advanced graphite materials increased significantly in and  as compared to prior years 
the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  silicon and oil and gas exploration  and defense and transportation industries 
we operated our advanced graphite materials capacity at very high levels in and overall  global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about a increase as compared to china s steel production continued to grow at a faster rate than the worldwide market 
in  china s production grew almost and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production was basic oxygen furnace related in however  china also remains the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity continued to grow  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
this contributed to a more favorable global pricing environment in demand for our advanced graphite materials increased significantly in as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  silicon and oil and gas exploration  and transportation industries 
outlook 
a number of external sources expect global and regional economic conditions to remain relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide total steel production will increase to about billion metric tons in  about higher than in global eaf steel production is expected to grow approximately 
if global economic conditions in are stable  we would expect worldwide graphite electrode demand is also to remain stable in we expect demand growth from the eaf steel market of about 
this increase in eaf demand is expected to be offset by a 
table of contents decrease in consumption 
as such  overall graphite electrode demand is expected to remain flat compared to if our outlook above is correct  we expect net sales of graphite electrodes to increase approximately over we expect upward pressure on most of our raw material costs  including freight  energy and petroleum based raw materials 
these cost increases will impact all of our product lines 
in  we believe that the overall demand for advanced graphite materials will remain at a high level  resulting from continued strength in the energy markets 
the continued overall strength of the economy in the markets served has kept the demand high for our core products which are used in the industrial and chemical sectors 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we expect depreciation expense to be approximately million 
our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report 
financing transactions on january   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of debentures at a price of of principal amount 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities  to make provisional payments of million against the fine the eu antitrust fine that was assessed against us in by the directorate general iv of the european communities the eu competition authority  and to fund general corporate purposes  including replacement of financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable that are complementary to our businesses 
the balance was invested in short term  investment quality  interest bearing securities or deposits 
on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
we believe the refinancing enhanced liquidity 
the revolving facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to million and matures in july during  we redeemed million of the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes due  at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
on january   we announced our plans to redeem an additional million 
this redemption occurred in february after these redemptions  million in principal of the senior notes remain outstanding 
antitrust litigation against us beginning in  the united states department of justice doj and other foreign antitrust authorities commenced investigations into alleged violations of the antitrust laws in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
these antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims have been resolved 
several of the investigations resulted in the imposition of fines against us which have been timely paid 
at december   million remained in the reserve for liabilities and expenses in connection with these antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  which have also been resolved 
in january  we paid the last scheduled installment of the fine imposed by the doj 
accordingly  there was no such reserve at december  other proceedings against us we are involved in various other investigations  lawsuits  claims  demands  environmental compliance programs  and other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters and proceedings  we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities

net sales for our other businesses decreased million  from million in to million in primarily related to decreased sales volumes of carbon electrodes  due to the exiting of this business  offset slightly by increased volumes for refractories and natural graphite products 
segment operating net income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands graphite electrode advanced graphite materials other businesses total segment operating income

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges  and a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  including corporate expenses  due to the continued application of our global cost cutting initiative 
segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales for advanced graphite materials decreased points to in however  total operating costs of million in increased million from operating costs of in this increase was due to a million unfavorable currency impact  caused by the strengthening euro 
selling  general  and administrative cost  including corporate expenses  and other production costs increased million in compared to this was caused by an increase in selling expenses of million due to currency impacts and an increase in administrative and other expenses of million  due primarily to increased icp costs and additional allocated corporate costs 
these increases were offset by decreased restructuring and impairment charges of million from segment operating costs and expenses for other businesses decreased million 
this was due to a million decrease due to the exiting the carbon electrode business in this decrease was offset slightly by an million increase in operating expenses for our refractories business  due primarily to increased expenses as a result of higher sales volumes 
our natural graphite products had increased operating expenses of million  due primarily to inventory revaluations of million offset by decreased sg a costs 
effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
during the past three years  we experienced higher freight  energy and other raw material costs primarily due to substantial increases in regional and worldwide market prices of natural gas and other petroleum based raw materials 
we seek to mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales through improved operating efficiencies  higher prices for our products and ongoing cost savings  and  in some cases  fixed price or derivative contracts 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
currency translation and transactions we account for our non us subsidiaries under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  except for highly inflationary countries  the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders deficit equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we account for our russian and mexican subsidiaries using the dollar as the functional currency  as sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses  including those from non permanent intercompany loans  as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 

table of contents effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur costs in us dollars and the currency of each of the six non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  and we sell our products in multiple currencies 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates affecting these currencies relative to the dollar and  to a limited extent  each other 
when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the us dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
during  the average exchange rate of the euro  the south african rand  the brazilian real and the mexican peso increased about   and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate of the brazilian real increased about when compared to the average exchange rate for the euro and the mexican peso did not fluctuate materially  and the south african rand decreased about when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate of the brazilian real and the euro increased about and respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for the south african rand decreased about  and the mexican peso did not fluctuate materially 
in the case of net sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was a decrease of about million in  an increase of about million in and an increase of million in in the case of cost of sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was an increase of about million in  an increase of about million in and an increase of million in we have non dollar denominated intercompany loans between graftech finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   the aggregate principal amount of these loans was million 
these loans are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
a portion of these loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and  as a result  translation gains and losses on these loans are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders deficit equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of these loans is deemed to be temporary and  as a result  translation gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we had a net total of million of currency losses  including million of exchange losses due to the translation of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
in  we had a net total of million of currency gains due to translation of inter company loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
in  we had a net total of million of currency losses due to translation of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
we have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings 
our uses of those funds other than 
table of contents for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with prior antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  payment of restructuring costs  pension and post retirement contributions  debt reduction payments and other obligations 
at december   we had total debt of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and a stockholders equity of million 
as part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable vendor terms to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
during and  certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million and million  respectively  at a cost lower than the cost to borrow a comparable amount for a comparable period under the revolving facility 
proceeds of the sale of receivables were used to reduce debt 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  and million higher at december  all such receivables sold during and were sold without recourse  and no amount of accounts receivable sold remained on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we use cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  funds from factoring arrangements and funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to million and  subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  an accordion feature that permits graftech finance to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with the revolving facility  of up to million 
at december   although there were no amounts drawn from the facility  million was available after consideration of outstanding letters of credit of million 
it is possible that our future ability to borrow under the revolving facility may effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the revolving facility 
the revolving facility matures in july we believe that our business strategies will continue to improve the amount and speed of cash generated from operations under current economic conditions 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these strategies are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs while they are being implemented 
we also believe these improvements in cash flow from operations should allow us to reduce our debt and other obligations over the long term 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the senior notes  the debentures and the revolving facility  as applicable 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants over the next twelve months 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
at december   substantially all of our debt consists of fixed rate obligations 
at december   the revolving facility had an effective interest rate of  our million principal amount of senior notes had a fixed rate of and our million principal amount of debentures had a fixed rate of

pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information services 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi managed our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
this contract was amended  effective september  to reduce the scope of cgi s management of our data center services  networks  desktops and telecommunications 
we are dependent on cgi for these services 
a failure by cgi to provide any of these services to us in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
b represents estimated postretirement  pension and related benefits obligations based on actuarial calculations 
c excludes the accounting for deferred financing costs or gains on the sale of hedge instruments 
payments assume senior notes  with a fixed rate of interest of  mature on february  and the debentures  with a fixed rate of interest of  effectively mature on january  d local lines of credit are established by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and are not part of the revolving facility 
the total amount available under the lines of credit amounted to million at december  cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations 
further  we have placed the highest priority on accelerating the amount and speed of cash generated every day 
our efforts include leveraging our global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
in addition  we may continue to exchange or repurchase senior notes or debentures as described below 

table of contents typically  our cash flow from operations fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements  and other factors 
in  we had positive cash flow from operations despite continued payments in connection with restructurings and antitrust investigations and the continued use of cash for working capital to  among other things  build inventories 
in and  we had positive cash flow from operations primarily from improved operating results 
we expect cash flow from operations to be positively impacted by reduced interest expense of about million related to our reduced senior note obligations  decreases in cash outlays for restructuring activities and the positive impact of our last anti trust payment made in january we expect our cash flow from operations to be negatively impacted by higher raw material prices  higher accounts receivable balances as a result of favorable pricing for graphite electrodes  the payment of certain international deferred taxes  and planned pension and post retirement contributions 
our debt and other obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our debt and other obligations  including our incentive compensation program payout in the second quarter of  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
our debt and these obligations make us more vulnerable to economic downturns in the event that these obligations are greater or timing of payment is sooner than expected 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with financial covenants in in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us and  to a limited extent  elsewhere 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide were only of global net sales during the last years 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce debt 
we may from time to time and at any time repurchase senior notes or debentures in open market or privately negotiated transactions  opportunistically on terms that we believe to be favorable 
in the first quarter of  we redeemed million of our senior notes using proceeds from the sale of our cathode business 
during the second quarter  we redeemed million 
during the third quarter of we redeemed an additional million 
these purchases were and in the future may be effected for cash from cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under the revolving facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or equity securities or assets  in exchange for common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
in december  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases may take place from time to time in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions  as market conditions warrant 
we intend to fund any such share repurchases from available cash and cash flows 
these share repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
related party transactions 
since january   we have not engaged in or been a party to any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our current or former subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet and compensatory transactions with directors and officers including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral  executive employee loans and stock purchases

costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 

table of contents reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts  including inventory valuations 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 

table of contents revenue recognition 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue from sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has passed  the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
product warranty claims and returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
volume discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in conjunction with the sale of the related products 
changes to estimates are recorded when they become probable 
shipping and handling revenues relating to products sold are included as an increase to revenue 
shipping and handling costs related to products sold are included as an increase to cost of sales 
stock based compensation plans 
we account for stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
accordingly  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair market value of the award and recognized over the requisite service period 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of grant  less required adjustments to reflect dividends paid and expected forfeitures or cancellations of awards throughout the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
our stock option compensation expense calculated under the fair value method  using a black scholes model  is recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in currency exchange rates and commercial energy rates 
we may from time to time enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties  if any  to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to non dollar denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments  which give the holder the right  
table of contents but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
the result is the creation of a range in which a best and worst price is defined  while minimizing option cost 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
during  we entered into two contracts to minimize foreign currency exposure against the euro 
both contracts expired in as a result  at december   we had no such contracts outstanding 
gains and losses associated with these contracts amounted to a gain of million in  and a loss of million in we did not enter into any such contracts during commercial energy rate management 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
the outstanding contracts at december  were a payable of million 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates on gross margin and changes in interest rates on interest expense 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by a nominal amount for the year ended december  as our debt is primarily fixed rate
