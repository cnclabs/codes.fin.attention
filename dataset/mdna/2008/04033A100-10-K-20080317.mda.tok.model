item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of breakthrough medicines to treat cancers by regulating cell signaling with small molecules 
we are developing a comprehensive approach to patients with cancer that addresses the greatest medical need aggressive and advanced stage cancers for which current treatments are inadequate 
our goal is to build a fully integrated oncology company focused on novel  molecularly targeted therapies to treat solid tumors and hematologic cancers  as well as the spread of primary tumors to distant sites 
our lead cancer product candidate  deforolimus  previously known as ap  has been or is being studied in multiple clinical trials in patients with various types of cancers 
we initiated patient enrollment in our initial phase clinical trial of deforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcoma in the third quarter of we discovered deforolimus in a research and development program conducted by us on behalf of ariad gene therapeutics  inc  or agti  our owned subsidiary 
in july  we entered into a global collaboration with merck co  inc  or merck  to jointly develop and commercialize deforolimus for use in cancer 
our collaboration with merck for the global development and commercialization of deforolimus anticipates that we together with merck will conduct a broad based development program in multiple indications 
the collaboration agreement provides that each party will fund of global development costs  except for certain specific costs to be funded by merck 
the collaboration agreement establishes responsibilities for supply of the product for development and commercial purposes  promotion  distribution and sales of the product  governance of the collaboration  termination provisions and other matters 
in addition to cost sharing provisions  the collaboration agreement provides for an up front payment by merck of million  which was paid to us in july  up to million in milestone payments based on the successful development of deforolimus in multiple cancer indications  of which million was paid to us in the fourth quarter of upon commencement of our phase clinical trial  and up to million in milestone payments based on achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
the up front payment and milestone payments  when earned and paid by merck  are non refundable 
merck has also agreed to provide us with up to million in interest bearing  repayable  development cost advances to cover a portion of our share of global development costs  after we have paid million in global development costs 
the collaboration agreement provides that each party will receive of the profit from sales of deforolimus in the united states  and merck will pay us tiered double digit royalties on sales of deforolimus outside the united states 
our second product candidate  ap  is anticipated to enter clinical development in we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  for this product candidate with the us food and drug administration  or fda  in late and expect to commence phase clinical trials in in patients with hematologic cancers as well as solid tumors 
in addition to our lead development programs  we have a focused drug discovery program centered on small molecule  molecularly targeted therapies and cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer 
we also have an exclusive license to a family of patents  three in the united states and one in europe  including a pioneering us patent  covering methods of treating human disease by regulating nf b cell signaling activity 
additionally  we have developed a proprietary portfolio of cell signaling regulation technologies  our argent technology  to control intracellular processes with small molecules  which may be useful in the development of therapeutic vaccines and gene and cell therapy products and which provide versatile tools for applications in cell biology  functional genomics and drug discovery research 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs  including those we conduct on behalf of agti 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and most of our revenue to date was received in connection with a joint venture we had with a major pharmaceutical company from to except for the gain on the sale of our interest in that joint venture in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
as a result of our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus  we expect that our license revenue will increase in future years 
however  we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  including costs for clinical trials and product manufacturing  pre commercial activities  personnel and our intellectual property 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
since july  pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement with merck  we have been sharing with merck ongoing global development costs for deforolimus on a basis except that merck is funding of the cost of development that is specific to development or commercialization of deforolimus outside the united states 
under the collaboration agreement  merck is also required to pay us up to million in milestone payments based on successful development of deforolimus in multiple cancer indications 
general our operating losses are primarily due to the costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  personnel and intellectual property protection and enforcement 
as our product development programs progress  we incur significant costs for toxicology and pharmacology studies  product development  manufacturing  clinical trials and regulatory support 
we also incur costs related to planning for potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of products  including market research and assessment 
these costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of product candidates in development  the stage of development of each product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
costs associated with our intellectual property include legal fees and other costs to prosecute  maintain  protect and enforce our intellectual property  which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the status of patent issues being pursued 
historically  we have relied primarily on the capital markets as our source of funding 
we may also obtain funding from collaborations with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and or medical device companies for development and commercialization of our product candidates  such as our collaboration with merck for the global development and commercialization of deforolimus 
these collaborations can take the form of licensing arrangements  co development or joint venture arrangements or other structures 
in addition  we utilize long term debt to supplement our funding  particularly as a means of funding investment in property and equipment and infrastructure needs 
if funding from these various sources is unavailable on reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operating expenses in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  scaling back or eliminating one or more of our product development programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  the carrying value of intangible assets  deferred compensation benefits for executives  and stock based compensation 
for the year ended december   we reported license and collaboration revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue is recorded based on up front payments  periodic license payments and milestone payments received or deemed probable of receipt  spread over the estimated performance period of the license or collaboration agreement 
regarding our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus  as of december   we have received an up front payment of million and a milestone payment of million related to the start of our phase clinical trial of deforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas 
we are recognizing revenues related to such payments on a straight line basis through  the estimated patent life of the underlying technology 
changes in development plans could impact the probability of receipt of future milestone payments on which revenue recognition is based 
in addition  changes in estimated performance periods  including changes in patent lives of underlying technology  could impact the rate of revenue recognition in any period 
such changes in revenue could have a material impact on our statement of operations 
at december   we reported million of intangible assets consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents or licenses 
changes in the estimated useful lives or a decision to discontinue using the technologies could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
for example  during and  we wrote off  and  respectively  of unamortized costs related to intangible assets which we are not actively pursuing any longer 
we have concluded that the carrying value of our remaining intangible assets is not currently impaired because such carrying value does not exceed the future net cash flows expected to be generated by such intangible assets 
if we were to abandon the underlying technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
the net book value as of december  of intangible assets related to our nf b technology is  if the patentability of our nf b patents is successfully challenged and such patents are subsequently narrowed  invalidated or circumvented  we may be required to write off some or all of the net book value related to such technology 
under our deferred executive compensation plans  we are required to adjust our recorded obligations to our employees on a periodic basis to reflect fair value based on the quoted market value of certain underlying mutual funds 
fluctuations in the quoted market value of such mutual funds can result in uneven expense charges or credits to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the market prices of the underlying mutual funds were higher at december   we would have recognized an additional  in compensation expense in in determining expense related to stock based compensation  we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  consultants and directors 
application of the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of factors such as the market value and volatility of our common stock  a risk free discount rate  and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in these factors can result in adjustments to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the market value of our common stock  its volatility or the expected life of stock options granted during the year ended december  were higher or lower than used in the valuation of such stock options  our valuation of  and total stock based compensation expense to be recognized for  such awards would have increased or decreased by up to   or  respectively 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to the revenue recognized from the merck collaboration  based on the non refundable up front and milestone payments  totaling million  paid by merck in the third and fourth quarters of  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the fda in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been tracked by product candidate because the number of product candidates and projects in r d may vary from time to time and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses deforolimus  our lead product candidate for which we have initiated our first phase clinical trial  was our only clinical program in and commencing in the third quarter of  the direct external expenses for deforolimus reflect our share of such expenses pursuant to the cost sharing arrangements of our collaboration with merck 
direct external expenses for deforolimus decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to the impact of merck s share of such expenses in of million  plus lower clinical trial and manufacturing costs related to a lower number of patients in trials in as compared to through december   we have incurred a total of approximately million in direct external expenses for deforolimus from the date it became a clinical program  net of merck s share of such expenses 
we expect that our direct external costs for deforolimus  net of merck s share of such costs  will increase in as we accelerate enrollment in our initial phase clinical trial for this product candidate  initiate additional clinical trials in other cancer indications and expand other clinical and non clinical development activities with merck 
our preclinical programs are focused on the development of additional novel  small molecule  molecularly targeted therapies including kinase inhibitors targeting cancer related processes such as cell survival  metastasis and angiogenesis 
our preclinical programs include our second product candidate  ap  for which we filed an ind in late as such  ap will be included in our clinical programs starting in direct external expenses on preclinical programs will increase or decrease over time depending on the status and number of programs in this stage of development and the mix between external and internal efforts applied to such programs 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs increased by million in as compared to due primarily to the cost of certain toxicology studies and contract manufacturing we conducted for ap in in support of the filing of the ind for this product candidate in the fourth quarter of we expect that our direct external expenses for ap will increase in  as we commence phase clinical trials for this product candidate 
we expect that direct external expenses for preclinical programs will decrease in  reflecting the transfer of ap from preclinical programs to clinical programs 
all other r d expenses decreased by  in as compared to due to the impact of merck s allocated share of such expenses of million  and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of million reflecting an increase in the useful life of leasehold improvements upon the extension of the term of the lease of our laboratory and office facility 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses of million  primarily related to stock based compensation expense of  resulting from grants of stock options in and an increase in the number of personnel and related expenses of  an increase in overhead expenses of million due to the expiration of a sub lease agreement for a portion of our office and laboratory facility in july and increases in other miscellaneous expenses  including maintenance and travel 
we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in in support of expanding development activities for our two lead product candidates 
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our drug development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our drug development programs will commence are unavailable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in due primarily to costs related to corporate and business development initiatives and to our patent infringement litigations against eli lilly and company  or lilly  and amgen inc  or amgen  respectively 
personnel and related costs increased by million due to an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments  and stock based compensation expense  resulting from grants of stock options in these increases were partially offset by decreases in miscellaneous expenses  including taxes and travel 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in reflecting an increase in commercial planning activities and required support of our research and development programs 
we expect that our operating expenses in total  net of merck s share of development costs of deforolimus  will increase in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on  among other things  the progress of our product development programs  including the planned increase in clinical trials and other studies related to deforolimus pursuant to our collaboration with merck  product manufacturing and initiation of clinical trials related to ap  developments in our patent infringement litigation and the availability of additional funding through the capital markets  our equity financing facility with azimuth opportunity ltd  collaborations  licensing joint ventures or other sources 
interest income expense interest income increased by to million in from million in  due to a higher average balance of funds invested in  offset in part by lower interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities in interest expense decreased by to  in from  in  as a result of lower interest rates and lower average loan balances in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  a decrease in loss of million  or 
such decrease was due primarily to the net effect of changes in r d expenses and general and administrative expenses noted above and the increase in license and collaboration revenue of million as a result of the merck collaboration 
we expect that our loss from operations in will increase as compared to due to the various factors described under revenue and operating expenses above 
losses may fluctuate depending on the progress of our product development programs and the status of our patent infringement litigation 
the extent of operating losses will also depend on the sufficiency of funds on hand or available from time to time  which will influence the amount we will spend on r d and the development timelines for our product candidates 
we reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  a decrease in net loss of million or  and a net loss per share of and  in and  respectively 
years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to the impact of the expected timing of receipt of future milestone payments pursuant to our agreement with medinol  ltd 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses research and development expenses r d expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses direct external expenses for deforolimus  our only clinical program in and  decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to decreases in clinical trial costs million and manufacturing related costs million 
the decrease in clinical trial costs is directly related to the decrease in the number of patients on trial during the period driven by successful conclusion in and of enrollment in several clinical trials 
manufacturing costs for deforolimus decreased in as compared to due to the completion in of certain product and process development studies and the timing of production runs of deforolimus 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs decreased by  in as compared to due primarily to the completion of certain pharmacology studies conducted by outside contract laboratories in all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to due to higher personnel and related costs as a result of an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments million and the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  regarding stock based compensation expense million  an increase in depreciation and amortization costs related to our property and equipment million and miscellaneous increases in costs related to our facility  including maintenance and utility costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in due primarily to costs related to expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and to our patent infringement litigation with lilly and amgen 
personnel and related costs increased by million due to an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments  and the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r million 
interest income expense interest income increased by to million in from million in  as a result of higher interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities  offset in part by a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense increased by to  in from  in  as a result of higher interest rates offset in part by lower average loan balances in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million  or 
such increase was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses noted above 
we reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or  and a net loss per share of in both and due to a greater weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding in from selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license and collaboration revenue net loss net loss per share in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license and collaboration revenue net loss net loss per share liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments to date primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus provides for additional funding in the form of up front and potential milestone payments  as well as the sharing of development costs for deforolimus 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  our sources of funds were as follows in thousands up front payment from merck  included in cash provided by operating activities maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases sales issuances of common stock in common stock offerings pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans our up front payment from merck of million was received pursuant to our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of deforolimus 
this up front payment is included in cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  but is presented separately in this analysis due to the non recurring nature of this payment 
the agreement also provides for  among other things  the payment by merck of up to million in development and regulatory milestones during the remaining development of deforolimus  including a million milestone payment which was received in the fourth quarter of  related to the start of our phase clinical trial in patients with metastatic sarcomas  and up to million based on the achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
milestone payments  including the million payment referred to above  are reflected as a reduction of cash used in operating activities in uses of funds later in this analysis 
we manage our marketable securities portfolio to provide cash for payment of our obligations 
we purchase marketable securities to enhance our yield on invested funds and when such amounts are not needed for near term payment of obligations 
we generally hold our marketable securities to maturity 
upon maturity of such marketable securities  a portion may be retained as cash to provide for payment of current obligations while the remainder will be reinvested in accordance with our investment policy 
for the years ended december   and  proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  purchases of marketable securities and the resulting net amount retained as cash for payment of obligations or reinvested was as follows in thousands proceeds from maturities of marketable securities purchases of marketable securities the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
in  and  we completed sales of our common stock for net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
the following table details our common stock offerings in  and number of shares price per share net cash proceeds in thousands august  october  march  we have filed shelf registration statements with the sec  from time to time  to register shares of our common stock or other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock  which was declared effective on january  on february   we filed another shelf registration statement with the sec which was amended on march  for the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock 
this filing was declared effective on march  as of december   after selling shares in the and offerings mentioned above  we had used all of the shares available for issuance under these shelf registrations 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities and or warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to million  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offerings 
this filing was declared effective on february  on february   we entered into an agreement with azimuth opportunity ltd  or azimuth  under which we may offer and sell  and azimuth is committed to purchase  subject to the terms set forth in the agreement  the lesser of up to million of our common stock  or the number of shares which is one less than twenty percent of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the effective date of the agreement 
these shares will be registered under the shelf registration statement we filed on january  the per share purchase price for these shares will equal the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on such date  less a discount ranging from to  with a minimum purchase price of per share below which azimuth is not required to purchase shares of our common stock 
the agreement expires in august upon each sale of common stock to azimuth  we will pay to reedland capital partners  an institutional division of financial west group  a placement fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount received by us from such sale 
in march  we sold to azimuth  shares of our common stock pursuant to this agreement 
we received aggregate gross proceeds from this sale of million  or million net of issuance expenses 
these shares were registered under our shelf registration statement filed on january  following this transaction  we have million available under our equity financing facility with azimuth and million of securities remaining for issuance under our shelf registration statement 
at december   the balance outstanding on our term loan agreement was million 
the loan is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest with a final payment of million due in march the terms of the loan require us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict additional indebtedness  additional liens  and sales of assets  and dividends  distributions or repurchases of common stock 
uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to repay our long term debt  to invest in intellectual property and to invest in our property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities less up front payment from merck adjusted net cash used in operating activities repayment of long term borrowings investment in intangible assets investment in property and equipment net cash provided by used in operating activities is comprised of our net losses  adjusted for non cash expenses and working capital requirements 
adjusted net cash used in operating activities excludes the favorable impact of the up front payment from merck of million in the third quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
as noted above  our net loss increased in  due primarily to the increased costs of advancing our product candidates through preclinical and clinical phases of development  expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and patent litigation  and decreased in  due primarily to the favorable impacts of the merck collaboration 
our adjusted net cash used in operating activities as presented above varied from year to year for the same reasons  including the favorable impact of the million milestone payment received from merck in the fourth quarter of also  as noted above  we expect that our net loss will increase in due to expansion of our product development activities 
we expect that our net cash used in operating activities  excluding the up front payment from merck  will increase in due to expansion of our product development activities but that such increase will be largely offset by milestone payments expected to be received from merck in we expect that our investment in intangible assets  consisting of our intellectual property  will increase in in support of our product development activities 
we expect that our investment in property and equipment will increase in to provide appropriate equipment and infrastructure in support of our research and development activities 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities for financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we maintained an outstanding letter of credit of  in accordance with the terms of our long term lease for our office and laboratory facility 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt agreement 
these contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december in thousands payments due by period total in through through after long term debt operating leases employment agreements other long term obligations long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of  our average interest rate on our debt at december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in other long term obligations are comprised primarily of obligations under our deferred executive compensation plans and license agreements 
the license agreements generally provide for payment by us of annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties upon successful commercialization of products 
all license agreements are cancelable by us 
the above table reflects remaining license fees for the lives of the agreements but excludes milestone and royalty payments  as such amounts are not probable or estimable at this time 
liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and working capital is primarily attributable to the non refundable up front and milestone payments of million we received in under the collaboration agreement with merck for the development and commercialization of deforolimus  offset in part by operating losses and changes in working capital requirements 
taking into account the impact of the merck collaboration  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  should be sufficient to satisfy our capital and operating requirements for more than twelve months 
there are numerous factors that are likely to affect our spending levels  including the planned expansion of clinical trials and other development activities for deforolimus in collaboration with merck  the planned initiation of clinical trials for ap  the progress of our preclinical and discovery programs  the potential acquisition of or other strategic transaction regarding the minority stockholders interests in agti  and developments in our nf kb litigation  among other factors 
these variables could result in higher or lower spending levels which could impact the sufficiency of our current funds if we are to continue operations in accordance with our current plans and achieve our intended timelines for development 
in any event  we may require substantial additional funding for our r d programs  including preclinical development and clinical trials  for operating expenses including intellectual property protection and enforcement  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals  and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
in order to fund our needs  we may  among other things  sell our securities through public or private offerings as market conditions permit or to azimuth under the equity financing facility  enter into a new long term debt or other credit agreement  enter into partnerships for our product candidates  and or license our cell signaling technologies  including our argent and nf b intellectual property portfolios 
there can be no assurance  however  that adequate resources will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us  if at all
