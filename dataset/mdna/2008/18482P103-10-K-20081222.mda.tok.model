item selected financial data not required item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations change in year end in june  we elected to change our fiscal year end from march to september in view of this change  this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a compares the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended september  with the most recently completed prior year which ended march  we are also comparing the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended september  with the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for twelve months ended september  in addition we are comparing the transition period of six months ended september  with the unaudited six months ended september  we have included summary information from the consolidated financial statements for the six months ended september  in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
throughout the md a  data for all periods except as of and for the twelve months ended september  and the six months ended september   are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements  which appear in this report

application of critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  loss from operations and net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include stock option accounting  accounting for income taxes  and valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
stock option accounting we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of april   the first day of our fiscal year our consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended march  reflect the impact of sfas r 
the compensation expense impacted both basic and diluted loss per share by less than for the year ended september  and the six months ended september  and the twelve months ended march  the company recorded related compensation expense of   and  respectively for the twelve months ended september   the six months ended september  and the twelve months ended march  as of september    of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated and do not include the impact of compensation expense calculated under sfas r 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant under sfas r  the company used the black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment 
because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at september   we have recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately  against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  consisting principally of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the company had us federal and state net operating loss nol carry forwards of approximately  which expire in fiscal years to to date the company has not completed a section analysis 
if certain ownership changes occurred under internal revenue code section  there may be further limitations on the usage of the net operating loss carry forwards 
realization of the nol carry forwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
the deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
we will continue to assess and evaluate strategies that will enable the deferred tax asset  or portion thereof  to be utilized  and will reduce the valuation allowance appropriately at such time when it is determined that the more likely than not approach is satisfied 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded a deferred income tax expense of  for the book and income tax basis difference in goodwill on acquisitions 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for income tax provisions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation requires that the company recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position 
recognition is allowed if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the provisions of fin became effective for the company on april  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  in the last quarter of each year  or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill primarily utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  and estimated expansion of the ftp market 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
this test for the period ended september  resulted in no change to goodwill from the prior period 
the test for fiscal year ended march  indicated that goodwill related to apacn was impaired 
accordingly  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of   after tax in the quarter ended march  the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas required recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event that events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred and when the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow attributed to such assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
no impairment of long lived assets has occurred during the periods ended september   september  and march   respectively 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
identifies the sources of accounting principles and provides entities with a framework for selecting the principles used in preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
the current gaap hierarchy has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts  which are subject to the same level of due process as fasb statements of financial accounting standards  below industry practices that are widely recognized as generally accepted but that are not subject to due process 
the board believes the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditors that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
the adoption of fasb is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position 
on february   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement but does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however on february   the fasb issued proposed fsp fas which delayed the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
we will adopt sfas  except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed fsp fas  on october  and do not believe the impact of this pronouncement will be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations
