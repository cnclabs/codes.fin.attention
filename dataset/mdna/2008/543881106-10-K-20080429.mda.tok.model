we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview businesses loral is a leading satellite communications company with a satellite manufacturing unit and investments in satellite services businesses 
loral is organized into two operating segments  satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
for the final two months of and going forward  loral participates in satellite services operations principally through its investment in telesat canada 
satellite manufacturing space systems loral  inc ss l  designs and manufactures satellites  space systems and space system components for commercial and government customers whose applications include fixed satellite services fss  direct to home dth broadcasting  mobile satellite services mss  broadband data distribution  wireless telephony  digital radio  digital mobile broadcasting  military communications  weather monitoring and air traffic management 
satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on its current cost structure  we estimate that ss l covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of five to six satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven 
it takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow 
while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  ss l has commenced a capacity expansion program through which ss l is seeking to accommodate as many as satellite awards per year depending on the complexity and timing of the specific satellites awarded  and which also provides for greater in house manufacturing of rf components and subassemblies 
this expansion  which includes the use of third party offsite capacity and the upgrading of existing ss l satellite test operations and rf assembly and test operations  is estimated to require total incremental capital expenditures of approximately million 
on february   ss l and northrop grumman announced that they are pursuing a group of initiatives to broaden each company s opportunities to provide the us government with cost competitive satellite systems 
as part of these initiatives  northrop grumman has agreed in principle to the use by ss l of its satellite test facilities and services  which would allow loral to better manage its capital expenditures for facilities expansion at ss l and the related cash flow requirements associated with that expansion 
the satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business  the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce 
the breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in ss l s workforce of approximately  personnel is one of our key competitive resources 
satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space 
this complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design  manufacture and testing of a satellite 
ss l establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs 
as most of ss l s contracts are fixed price  cost increases in excess of these provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to ss l  which may be material 
the highly competitive satellite manufacturing industry has recently recovered from a several year period in the early part of this decade when order levels reached an unprecedented low level 
buyers  as a result  have had the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices  terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by manufacturers such as ss l 
ss l was further handicapped while it was in chapter  because of buyers reluctance to purchase satellites from a company in bankruptcy 
satellite services on october   loral and its canadian partner  psp  through a newly formed joint venture  completed the acquisition of telesat canada from bce 
in connection with this acquisition  loral transferred substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of loral skynet to telesat canada 
loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in telesat holdco  the ultimate parent company of the resulting new entity see note to the financial statements 
the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once these investments are made  however  the costs to maintain and operate the fleet are relatively low with the exception of in orbit insurance 
upfront investments are earned back through the leasing of transponders to customers over the life of the satellite 
after nearly years of operation  telesat canada has established collaborative relationships with its customers so annual receipts from the satellite services business are fairly predictable with long term contracts and high contract renewal rates 
competition in the satellite services market has been intense in recent years due to a number of factors  including transponder over capacity in certain geographic regions and increased competition from fiber 
this competition puts pressure on prices  depending on market conditions in various geographic regions and frequency bands 
a stronger economy and an increase in capital available for expanded consumer and enterprise level services have more recently led to an improvement in demand in certain markets 
much of telesat canada s currently unleased capacity  however  is over geographic regions where the market is characterized by excess capacity  coupled with weak demand  or where regulatory obstacles are such that the company finds itself at a competitive disadvantage compared to local operators 
as of december   telesat canada s twelve in orbit satellites comprised of both owned and leased satellites had an average of approximately of their expected total service life remaining  with an average expected remaining service life in excess of eight years 
three additional satellites  two of which are under construction at ss l  are scheduled for launch in and two of the satellites under construction are already contracted to bell expressvu for years or such later date as the customer may request 
until the closing of the telesat canada transaction  loral skynet operated a global fixed satellite services business 
as part of this business  loral skynet leased transponder capacity to commercial and government customers for video distribution and broadcasting  high speed data distribution  internet access and communications  and also provided managed network services to customers using a hybrid satellite and ground based system 
it also provided professional services to other satellite operators such as fleet operating services 
at october   loral skynet had four in orbit satellites and one satellite under construction at ss l 
bankruptcy reorganization during the years  the sustained and unprecedented decline in demand for our satellites and the transponder over capacity in our satellite services business exacerbated old loral s already strained financial condition brought on primarily by the investments we had previously made in globalstar  lp globalstar that we subsequently wrote off 
globalstar filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions under chapter in february on july   old loral and certain of its subsidiaries the debtor subsidiaries and collectively with old loral  the debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter during the ensuing two and a half year period we further increased our emphasis on cash conservation by reducing operating expenses and closely monitoring capital expenditures 
on august   the bankruptcy court entered its confirmation order confirming the plan of reorganization 
on september   the federal communications commission the fcc approved the transfer of fcc licenses from old loral to loral space communications inc  which represented satisfaction of the last material condition precedent to emergence 
the debtors emerged from their reorganization proceeding under chapter on november  pursuant to the plan of reorganization 
pursuant to sop we adopted fresh start accounting as of october  see notes and to the financial statements 
future outlook critical success factors for ss l include maintaining its reputation for reliability  quality and superior customer service 
these factors are vital to securing new customers and retaining current ones 
at the same time  we must continue to contain costs and maximize efficiencies 
ss l is focused on increasing bookings and backlog  while maintaining the cost efficiencies and process improvements realized over the past several years 
in addition  ss l must continue to align its direct workforce with the level of awards 
in order to complete construction of all the satellites in backlog and to accommodate long term growth  ss l will need  and is hiring additional staff 
long term growth at ss l will also require expanded facilities  and working capital requirements  primarily for the orbital component of the satellite contract which is payable to ss l over the life of the satellite 
as a result of the closing of the telesat canada transaction  loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in the world s fourth largest satellite operator with approximately billion of backlog as of december  the integration of loral skynet s and telesat canada s operations offers customers expanded satellite and terrestrial coverage while continuing to offer superior customer service 
we believe that this transaction allows the combined company to compete more effectively in the fss industry than either loral skynet or telesat canada would have been able to do on its own 
telesat canada is committed to continuing to provide the strong customer service and focus on innovation and technical expertise that has allowed it to successfully build its business to date 
building on its industry leading backlog and significant contracted growth  telesat canada s focus is on taking disciplined steps to grow the core business and sell existing in construction satellite capacity  successfully integrate with loral skynet to improve operating efficiency  and  in a disciplined manner  use the strong cash flow generated by existing business  contracted expansion satellites and cost savings to strengthen the business 
telesat canada believes its existing satellite fleet offers a strong combination of existing backlog  contracted revenue growth on anik f  and on the in construction satellites nimiq and nimiq and additional capacity on the existing satellites and telstar n that provides a solid foundation upon which it will seek to grow its revenues and cash flows 
when two satellite operators merge  there usually is significant overlap in their operations 
telesat canada has implemented a comprehensive integration plan that has resulted in a substantial headcount reduction in certain areas of the company and consolidated a number of loral skynet and telesat canada facilities  including satellite and network operations centers  resulting in the achievement of significant cost synergies 
telesat canada has targeted approximately cad million in annual cost savings  approximately two thirds of these cost savings will result from the reduction in staffing levels 
telesat canada believes that its integration activities are proceeding according to plan  that significant cost savings have been achieved  and that the balance of the projected cost savings will be achieved over a one to two year period 
telesat canada believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates 
telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers  who will commit to a substantial amount of capacity at the time the satellite construction contract is signed 
although telesat canada regularly pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  it does not procure additional or replacement satellites unless it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such capacity 
the satellite industry is characterized by a relatively fixed cost base that allows significant revenue growth with relatively minimal increases in operating costs  particularly for sales of satellite capacity 
thus  telesat canada anticipates that it can increase its revenue without proportional increases in operating expenses  allowing for margin expansion 
the fixed cost nature of the business  combined with contracted revenue growth  other growth opportunities and cost savings from integration synergies is expected to produce growth in operating income and cash flow 
for  telesat canada is focused on the execution of its business plan to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates  the sale of capacity on its existing satellites  the continuing execution of its integration plan to achieve operating efficiencies  and on the completion and launch of its three in construction satellites nimiq  telstar n  and nimiq 
we regularly explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers  satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
for example  in connection with an agreement entered into between ss l and viasat  inc viasat for the construction by ss l for viasat of a high capacity broadband satellite called viasat the viasat satellite  on january   we entered into certain agreements see note to the financial statements  pursuant to which we are investing in the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite and granting to telesat canada an option to acquire our rights to the canadian payload 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we will require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for these transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
in connection with the telesat canada transaction  loral has agreed that  subject to certain exceptions described in telesat canada s shareholders agreement  for so long as loral has an interest in telesat canada  it will not compete in the business of leasing  selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service  broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the c band  ku band and ka band including in each case extended band frequencies and the business of providing end to end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals  space segment  and  where appropriate  networking hubs 
consolidated operating results please refer to critical accounting matters set forth below in this section 
the following discussion of revenues and adjusted ebitda reflects the results of our business segments for  and the balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results unless otherwise noted 
as previously discussed  we emerged from chapter on november  and adopted fresh start accounting as of october  as a result of the adoption of fresh start accounting  the successor registrant s financial statements are not comparable with the predecessor registrant s financial statements 
references to full year financial information throughout this discussion combine the periods of january  to october  with october  to december  management believes that presenting the financial information in this way is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons 
the common definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in evaluating financial performance  we use revenues and operating income loss before depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock based compensation  gain on contribution of loral skynet and reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy adjusted ebitda as the measure of a segment s profit or loss 
adjusted ebitda is equivalent to the common definition of ebitda before reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy  gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments  gain on contribution of loral skynet  gain loss on investments and foreign exchange contracts  loss on extinguishment of debt  other income expense  equity in net income losses of affiliates  and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization  interest and investment income  interest expense  reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy  other income expense  net losses of affiliates and minority interest 
financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures  the amount of intangible assets recorded  the differences in assets lives  the timing and amount of investments  the effects of other income expense  which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business  and effects of investments not directly managed 
the use of adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items 
competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures 
the use of adjusted ebitda maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense 
in addition  during chapter  we recognized interest expense only on the actual interest payments we made 
during this period  we did not make any further interest payments on our debt obligations after march   the date we repaid our secured bank debt 
reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy were only incurred during the period we were in chapter these expenses have been excluded from adjusted ebitda to maintain comparability with our results during periods in which we were not in chapter and with the results of competitors using similar measures 
we believe the use of adjusted ebitda along with us gaap financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors  estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions 
adjusted ebitda as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance of our segments  to allocate resources and capital to such segments  to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should be used in conjunction with us gaap financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
loral is organized into two segments satellite manufacturing and satellite services

the net gain on these transactions  which was realized when the instruments were contributed to telesat holdco on october   has been recognized in the statement of operations and avoided a corresponding increase in the us dollar purchase price equivalent that would have been paid to bce for telesat canada see notes and to the financial statements 
loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   we recorded a charge for the early extinguishment of the loral skynet senior secured notes  which is comprised of a million redemption premium and a million write off of deferred financing costs 
other income expense other income increased million  primarily due to the recognition of a million deferred gain realized in in connection with the sale of an orbital slot in compared to million recognized in and the write off of an investment of million in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by losses on foreign currency transactions other than the foreign exchange contracts related to the telesat canada transaction 
income tax provision benefit during  and  we continued to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
however  upon emergence from bankruptcy in  we reversed our valuation allowance relating to million of deferred tax assets for amt credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had valuation allowances totaling million  which included a balance of million relating to old loral periods preceding our adoption of fresh start accounting on october  we will continue to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
if  in the future  we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets  any reduction to the valuation allowance existing as of october  will first reduce goodwill  then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital 
during  we utilized the benefits from million of deferred tax assets from old loral to reduce our current tax liability 
the realization of this benefit created an excess valuation allowance of million  the reversal of which was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
our income tax provision and benefit can be summarized as follows i for  we recorded a current tax provision of million  including a provision of million to increase our liability for uncertain tax positions  and a deferred tax provision of million  resulting in a total provision of million on pre tax income of million  ii for  we recorded a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax provision of million  resulting in a total provision of million on pre tax income of million  and iii for  we recorded a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million  resulting in a net benefit of million on pre tax income of billion  which included a gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments of billion 
the increase to our current provision for as compared to and was attributable to the higher amount of taxable income in the current year after deducting our allowable tax nols based upon the restrictions imposed by section of the internal revenue code and the additional provision required for uncertain tax positions 
for  we projected federal tax income of approximately million after claiming our allowable deduction for tax nols of million  which included the tax gain of million from the contribution of substantially all of the loral skynet assets and related liabilities to telesat canada and the gain of million on the forward contracts and currency basis swap entered into by loral skynet relating to the telesat canada transaction 
the deferred income tax provision for of million related primarily to i a provision of million on current year income to the extent the taxes imposed on such income were reduced by deferred tax benefits from old loral as discussed above  the utilization of these deferred tax benefits created an excess valuation allowance of million  the reversal of which was recorded as a reduction to goodwill  ii a provision of million for the decrease to our deferred tax asset for federal and state amt credits which excludes an increase to amt credits of million upon adoption of fin  iii an additional valuation allowance of million required against a net deferred tax asset created when we reduced the deferred tax credits in accumulated other comprehensive income by million  offset by iv a benefit of million relating to current activity 
the deferred income tax provision for of million related to i a provision of million on current year income to the extent the taxes imposed on such income were reduced by deferred tax benefits from old loral and the utilization of these deferred tax benefits created an excess valuation allowance of million  the reversal of which was recorded as a reduction to goodwill  ii offset by a benefit of million for the increase to our deferred tax asset for additional federal and state amt credits 
during  we also recorded a deferred tax provision of million in accumulated other comprehensive income related primarily to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas see note  which created an excess valuation allowance of million that was reversed as a reduction to goodwill 
for  in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy  old loral realized cancellation of debt income cod on its federal income tax return of approximately million 
cod realized while in bankruptcy is excluded from federal taxable income 
we were required to reduce certain of our tax attributes  and to the extent sufficient attributes were not available on a separate company basis  reduce the tax basis in our assets  by an amount equal to the cod excluded by old loral from its taxable income 
this adjustment resulted in a reduction of approximately million to our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance 
also  as part of our fresh start accounting and plan of reorganization adjustments  we recognized a net income tax benefit of million  which includes a net deferred tax benefit of million

backlog backlog as of december  and  was as follows in millions satellite manufacturing satellite services total backlog before eliminations satellite manufacturing eliminations satellite services eliminations total backlog it is expected that of satellite manufacturing backlog as of december  will be recognized as revenue during telesat canada backlog at december  was approximately billion  of which approximately will be recognized as revenue during  assuming no significant delay in the launch of the nimiq satellite 
included in backlog as of december  are contracts covering the entire capacity of the nimiq and nimiq satellites  which have been leased for the life of the satellites 
these contracts contain provisions such that the customers  assuming the respective satellites are successfully and timely launched and are operating nominally  may only terminate their contracts by paying telesat canada the present value of the entire contracted amounts that would have been due for the remaining life of the satellite 
telesat canada has received approximately million of customer prepayments  including approximately million relating to satellites under construction 
if the launch of a satellite under construction were to fail or a customer were to terminate its contract with telesat canada as a result of a substantial delay in the launch of the satellite  telesat canada would be obligated to return the customer prepayments applicable to such satellite 
such repayment obligations would be funded by insurance proceeds if any  cash on hand and or borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
fresh start accounting in connection with our emergence from chapter  we adopted fresh start accounting as of october   which required all of our assets and liabilities to be stated at estimated fair value see note to the financial statements 
significant judgment was exercised by management in estimating the fair values 
revenue recognition most of our satellite manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties  performance incentives and orbital incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us 
billed receivables  vendor financing and long term receivables we are required to estimate the collectibility of our billed receivables  vendor financing and long term receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
charges for recoveries of bad debts recorded to the income statement on billed receivables for the years ended december  and and the periods october  to december  and january  to december   were million  million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically 
inventories inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and  if appropriate  are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
charges for inventory obsolescence recorded to the income statement for the year ended december  were insignificant 
charges for inventory obsolescence recorded to the income statement for the year ended december   the period october  to december   and the period january  to october  were million  million and million  respectively 
evaluation of investments in affiliates for impairment the carrying values of our investments in affiliates are reviewed for impairment in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other than temporary impairment 
an impairment loss would be recognized when there has been a loss in value of the affiliate that is other than temporary 
taxation management has concluded that  as of december   the company had a material weakness with respect to accounting for and disclosure of income taxes 
specifically  the company did not maintain adequate processes and a sufficient number of technically qualified personnel to facilitate the timely resolution of issues associated with the company s income tax closing process primarily relating to those issues attributable to the telesat canada transaction 
as a result of this material weakness  management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  was not effective based on the criteria in internal control integrated framework 
additional review  evaluation and oversight have been undertaken to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and  as a result  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this form k present fairly  in all material respects  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 
the company is evaluating several remedial steps to improve controls surrounding its income tax closing process  including enhancing the technical resources in the income tax accounting function and conducting an evaluation of organizational processes and structure to identify and implement the appropriate solutions regarding its income tax closing process including retaining additional external resources 
new loral  as a delaware company  is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income 
prior to the effective date  old loral  as a bermuda company  was subject to us taxation on any income that was effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business as well as a withholding tax on dividends and interest received from its us subsidiaries 
our us subsidiaries continue to be subject to us taxation on their worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria in sfas based upon this analysis  we concluded during the fourth quarter of that  due to insufficient positive evidence substantiating recoverability  a valuation allowance should be established for our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  which when offset by our deferred tax liabilities of million and our valuation allowance of million  resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
for  we continued to maintain the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets decreasing the valuation allowance at december  of million by million to a balance of million at december   which included million relating to the opening balance at october  we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
if  in the future  we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets  any reduction to the valuation allowance as of october  will first reduce goodwill  then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital 
during  we reversed million of excess valuation allowance and million of deferred state tax liabilities relating to the balance as of october   which were recorded as reductions to goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for benefits to be recognized in the financial statements  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
prior to adopting fin  our policy was to establish tax contingency liabilities for potential audit issues 
the tax contingency liabilities were based on our estimate of the probable amount of additional taxes that may be due in the future 
any additional taxes due would be determined only upon completion of current and future federal  state and international tax audits 
at december   we had million of tax contingency liabilities included in long term liabilities 
during  we had increased the tax contingency liabilities by million through the current income tax provision  settled million with payment and reversed million of the opening balance as of october  to goodwill for issues where the statute of limitations on assessment of tax had expired during see notes and to the financial statements 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain a pension plan and a supplemental retirement plan 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
these pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices  such as the moody s aa corporate bond index  are also considered 
the discount rate determined on this basis was as of december   an increase of basis points from december  this had the effect of reducing our benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits by million as of december   as compared with december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
pension plan assets are managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by russell 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
based on this target allocation  the twenty year historical return of our asset mix has been 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for and for and for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 
effective july   we amended our pension plan to standardize the future benefits earned at all company locations for eligible employees 
these amendments did not change any benefits earned through june  as a result of the amendments  all locations now have a career average plan that requires an employee contribution in order to receive the highest level of benefits 
all current participants now earn future benefits under the same formula and have the same early retirement provisions 
the amendments did not apply to certain employees under a bargaining unit arrangement 
additionally  employees hired after june   do not participate in the defined benefit pension plan but participate in our defined contribution savings plan with an additional company contribution 
as a result of these amendments  our ongoing pension expense has been reduced commencing july  these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to increase to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to a curtailment gain of million in related to the contribution of loral skynet to telesat canada  partially offset by the increase in the discount rate and the expected return on assets 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  the unfunded benefit obligations 
in connection with our adoption of sfas  we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
as a result  in we reduced our recorded liability for pensions by million  with a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income  and increased our recorded liability for other benefits by million  with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income  to adjust to our actual unfunded benefit obligations 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans 
stock based compensation effective october   in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting  we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  for all stock options granted by us after october   pursuant to the prospective method provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
in addition  we account for options granted to non employees in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to measure fair value of these stock option awards 
this is the same method we used in prior years for disclosure purposes 
the black scholes merton model requires us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the model  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation we recognize 
see notes and to the financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the company s reorganization equity value exceeded the fair value of its tangible assets and identified intangible assets less its liabilities as of october  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is not amortized and is subject to an annual impairment test which the company performs on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
our test of goodwill impairment for and did not result in any goodwill impairment 
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units the operating segment 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires a significant amount of judgment by management 
as of december   intangible assets consist primarily of internally developed software and technology and trade names recorded in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting 
the fair values of our intangible assets were calculated using several approaches that encompassed the use of excess earnings  relief from royalty and the build up methods 
the excess earnings  relief from royalty and build up approaches are variations of the income approach 
the income approach  more commonly known as the discounted cash flow approach  estimates fair value based on the cash flows that an asset can be expected to generate over its useful life 
this process involves subjective judgment by management 
identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
the most important contingencies affecting our financial statements are detailed in note to the financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and available credit as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash million included in other current assets and million included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet with no outstanding debt or established lines of credit other than a million cash collateralized letter of credit facility with jp morgan chase bank 
based on the company s working capital needs on its current base of business  capital expenditures to complete its expansion initiatives  requirements for appropriate contingencies  and resources for future growth initiatives  the company expects to require additional capital this year 
this new financing will permit us to meet unexpected cash requirements due to unforeseen changes to our business as well as provide cash liquidity for working capital and for strategic investments as opportunities arise 
in the past  our ability to obtain satellite contract awards has depended in part on our ability to provide vendor financing to our customers or to make equity investments in them 
the company is currently exploring its financing options and expects to implement its plan to raise additional capital during if the company is not successful in obtaining such financing  its ability to manage unforeseen cash requirements  to meet contingencies  to obtain new satellite construction contracts and to make strategic investments will be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
on october   the transaction for the purchase of telesat canada from bce was closed 
our net cash funding requirement for this transaction was approximately million  primarily for the redemption of loral skynet s series a preferred stock  partially offset by cash receipts from telesat canada for certain skynet assets sold to them  as well as true up payments from psp to bring the equity contributions into the required economic positions 
this was funded from cash on hand  which includes cash received from the issuance of the million preferred stock financing described below 
as part of the transaction  a final adjustment payment of approximately million was made by loral to psp on april  and is included in the million referenced above and as a payable in our financial statements at december  telesat canada is subject to covenants in its debt agreements that restrict cash payments to its shareholders cash payments of dividends to shareholders are restricted under the credit agreement 
cash payments to loral under our consulting agreement with telesat canada are also restricted by the credit agreement 
loral does not believe that it will receive cash dividends nor that telesat canada will be permitted to make the million fee payment under the consulting agreement in cash in the near term 
the company has an investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
the company s investment policy establishes conservative policies relating to and governing the investment of its surplus cash 
the company s investment policy allows it to invest in commercial paper  money market funds and other similar short term investments but does not permit the company to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit the company to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all liquidity requirements of the company and to provide a competitive rate of return 
the investment policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on the company s behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
the company operates its investment program under the guidelines of its investment policy and continuously monitors its investments and policies 
the company believes that its policies and monitoring program mitigate the risks with regard to its current investments 
loral currently maintains its cash in liquid money market funds 
we do not currently hold any investments in auction rate securities or enhanced money market funds that have been subject to recent liquidity issues and price declines 
we do not anticipate moving into short term investments for the foreseeable future until liquidity returns to these markets 
on february   loral completed a million preferred stock financing pursuant to the securities purchase agreement entered into with mhr on october   as amended and restated on february  the securities purchase agreement 
see note to the financial statements 
the price of loral s common stock on october   the day before we signed the securities purchase agreement  was and the conversion price was 
the price of loral s common stock on february   when the financing closed was 
because of the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date the financing closed  as compared to the conversion price  the company is required to reflect a beneficial conversion feature of the loral series a preferred stock as a component of its net income loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  we will also reflect a beneficial conversion feature in a similar manner for the series b preferred stock  in the period in which shareholder approval of the creation of the new class of class b non voting common stock is received 
this beneficial conversion feature is recorded as a decrease to net income applicable to common shareholders and results in a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share results 
accordingly  in the three months ended march   we recorded an increase to net loss applicable to common shareholders of million 
in the period in which shareholder approval of the new class of class b non voting common stock is received  we expect that our net income loss applicable to common shareholders will be reduced increased  as applicable  by approximately million reflecting the beneficial conversion feature less discount  if any  for the class b non voting common stock because of its non voting status 
to the extent that dividends on the loral series preferred stock are paid in additional shares of loral series a preferred stock  we record an additional beneficial conversion feature that reduces our net income applicable to common shareholders 
for the year ended december   we recorded a beneficial conversion feature of million for dividends paid in additional shares of loral series a preferred stock 
we will also record an additional beneficial conversion feature in a similar manner for dividends paid in additional shares of loral series b preferred stock in the period in which shareholder approval of the class b non voting common stock is received  and thereafter 
for dividends paid and accrued through december  on the loral series b preferred stock  the beneficial conversion feature that will be recorded when shareholder approval of the class b non voting common stock is received  is approximately million 
cash requirements at satellite manufacturing are driven primarily by working capital requirements to finance long term receivables associated with satellite contracts  other vendor financing and capital spending required to maintain and expand the manufacturing facility 
while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  ss l has commenced a capacity expansion program through which ss l is seeking to accommodate as many as satellite awards per year depending on the complexity and timing of the specific satellites awarded  as well as to provide for greater in house manufacturing of rf components and subassemblies 
this expansion  which includes the use of third party offsite capacity and the upgrading of existing ss l satellite test operations and rf assembly and test operations  is estimated to require total incremental capital expenditures of approximately million 
on february   ss l and northrop grumman announced that they are pursuing a group of initiatives to broaden each company s opportunities to provide the us government with cost competitive satellite systems 
as part of these initiatives  northrop grumman has agreed in principle to the use by ss l of its satellite test facilities and services  which would allow loral to better manage its capital expenditures for facilities expansion at ss l and the related cash flow requirements associated with that expansion 
historically  a portion of satellite manufacturing revenues are paid to ss l in the form of orbitals  receivable payments from its customers that are earned over the life of the satellite 
these payments are contingent upon continued satellite performance 
as of december   ss l had orbital receivables of million  which will be received  generally over years from launch  an increase of million from orbital receivables of million as of december  continued growth in the satellite manufacturing business will result in a corresponding growth in the amount of such orbital receivables 
on november   ss l entered into a second amendment to its million cash collateralized amended and restated letter of credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank extending the maturity of the facility to december  letters of credit are available until the earlier of the stated maturity of the letter of credit  the termination of the facility  or december  outstanding letters of credit are fully cash collateralized 
as of december   million of letters of credit under this facility were issued and outstanding 
on july   ss l entered into an amended and restated customer credit agreement the credit agreement with sirius satellite radio inc sirius 
the credit agreement amends and restates in its entirety the customer credit agreement entered into by ss l and sirius on june  the original credit agreement 
the purpose of the amendment and restatement is to make available to sirius financing for the purchase of a second satellite under the amended and restated satellite purchase agreement between sirius and ss l dated as of july  the amended satellite purchase agreement 
under the credit agreement  ss l has agreed to make loans to sirius in an aggregate principal amount of up to  to finance the purchase of the sirius fm and fm satellites the sirius satellites 
loans made under the credit agreement are secured by sirius rights under the amended satellite purchase agreement  including its rights to the sirius satellites 
the loans are also entitled to the benefits of a subsidiary guarantee from satellite cd radio  inc  and  subject to certain exceptions  any future material subsidiary that may be formed by sirius thereafter 
the maturity date of the loans is the earliest to occur of i june   ii days after the fm satellite becomes available for shipment and iii days prior to the scheduled launch of the fm satellite 
loans made under the credit agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to three month libor plus a margin 
the credit agreement permits sirius to prepay all or a portion of the loans outstanding without penalty  and  upon the occurrence of certain events  sirius is required to prepay the loans 
as of december   no loans were outstanding under the credit agreement 
sirius is currently eligible to borrow million under the credit agreement  representing reimbursement of payments previously made by sirius under the amended satellite purchase agreement 
on september   loral skynet entered into a loan and security agreement with valley national bank valley national 
the purpose of this loan agreement was to make available to loral skynet a loan the loan to fund the redemption the note redemption of loral skynet s senior secured notes see note to the financial statements 
pursuant to this loan agreement  valley national made the loan in a single advance of  which loral skynet used to fund the note redemption on september  this loan was fully cash collateralized with a cd purchased by loral and held by valley national 
the interest rate on the loan was per annum 
on october   the loan was assumed by telesat canada as part of the telesat canada transaction and was repaid in full that same day by telesat canada 
also on october   the cash collateral cd was released and the cash was returned to loral 
telesat canada cash and available credit as of december   telesat canada had cad million of cash and short term investments as well as cad million of borrowing availability under its revolving facility and million of borrowing availability under its us term ii loan facility as discussed below
