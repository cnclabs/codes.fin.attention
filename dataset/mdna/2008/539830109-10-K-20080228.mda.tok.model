the administration s priorities include balancing the budget by  combating terrorism and protecting the homeland  promoting economic growth  and controlling non security and entitlement spending 
over half of the discretionary spending in the budget proposal is allocated to defense and other security needs to be addressed by the departments of defense  homeland security  and state all key customers of ours 
for fiscal year  the president s budget proposes billion for the department of defense dod  reflecting the administration s commitment to continued modernization of our armed forces and sustainment of current capabilities 
this amount  called the base budget  excludes any funding for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan or the global war on terrorism 
these costs  discussed below  are requested as emergency supplemental funding 
the fiscal year dod base budget is an increase of billion  or  over the fiscal year base budget as enacted into law at the end of the dod base budget includes billion for procurement of systems and equipment procurement and billion for research  development  test  and evaluation rdt e  collectively termed the investment accounts 
the proposed investment budget of billion represents a nearly increase in the investment accounts over fiscal year enacted levels and represents a record high level of funding for these accounts 
the operations and maintenance accounts  which contain the bulk of funding for training  logistics  services  and other sustainment activities  total approximately billion for fiscal year  an increase of billion  or nearly  over fiscal year enacted levels 
the balance of the budget  billion  includes amounts for military pay and benefits  construction  and other activities 
over the fiscal years  total dod funding is expected to rise to billion in  or higher than the fiscal year budget 
total proposed funding for the dod over this five year period is nearly trillion  reflecting both the significant increase in the same five year period in the budget proposal submitted in february of  as well as a small additional increase in this year s plan 
in addition to the base dod budget  the administration is again requesting funding to defray costs for operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom in afghanistan 
the fiscal year budget proposal includes billion in supplemental funding for the ongoing war on terrorism  which is billion higher than anticipated in last year s budget proposal 
this amount reflects only costs anticipated to be incurred in the first several months of fiscal year to ensure continuity of funding during the transition to the next administration  which will begin in january of  and the budget proposal assumes the next administration will determine what additional amounts may be required for these activities 
the 
table of contents budget proposal also assumes congress will approve the full billion in supplemental funding requested for fiscal year  of which only billion had been approved at the time of the budget submission 
total funding requested for the fiscal year base and supplemental budgets is billion 
details of the supplemental funding request have not yet been released 
supplemental funding enables the dod to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs  versus using funds available for those programs to pay for the iraq and afghanistan missions 
while congress has expressed concern about the size of supplemental budgets  funding for ongoing operations has not been significantly curtailed by congress 
we expect that congress will approve the remaining fiscal year supplemental funding in a timely fashion  and  thus  we do not believe that the cost of ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan will materially impact the investment accounts in the near term 
we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the dod 
our key aircraft programs are strongly supported in the fiscal year dod budget request 
the request includes billion for f raptor air dominance fighter aircraft produced under a multiyear contract entered into in  and billion for the f lightning ii joint strike fighter program 
funding of million is proposed for procurement of c j aircraft  as well as advance procurement for additional c js 
the budget also includes million to continue upgrades of the c strategic airlift aircraft 
the fiscal year budget request includes billion  an increase of million over fiscal year  for missile defense capabilities 
we are represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air and space based missile defense  including the aegis weapon system program  the medium extended air defense system meads  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  and the multiple kill vehicle mkv program 
in the areas of space based intelligence and information superiority  we have leadership positions on programs such as the tsat mission operations system tmos  mobile user objective system muos  the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  the space based infrared system high sbirs h and classified programs 
space based systems are robustly funded in the fiscal year request at billion 
the fiscal year budget proposes billion for an array of command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr programs 
we are well positioned in these capabilities  including the air operations center weapons system integrator  the warfighter information network tactical  the combatant commanders integrated command and control system  and the global communications support system air force 
we will continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions  missile  and other systems  such as hellfire  guided multiple launch rocket systems  and eq  to our warfighters 
we are bringing our systems integration expertise as well as our existing advanced technology products and services into adjacent military product lines  such as the littoral combat ship and the vh us presidential helicopter programs  both of which are supported in the fiscal year budget request 
we are well positioned to expand in these adjacent markets  as well as in unmanned systems capabilities  including air  ground  and underwater systems 
we are a significant presence in information technology support and modernization for the dod 
we see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity of the systems procured by our customers and improving global supply chain management  and we see opportunities to grow our business in providing global services and business process management across the dod enterprise 
most of the aforementioned programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles 
there is always an inherent risk that these and other dod programs could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs  either in the administration s budget reviews or in the congressional process of annual appropriations 
us government non department of defense business the war on terrorism has focused greater attention on the security of our homeland and the need for better communication and interoperability among law enforcement  civil government agencies  intelligence agencies  and our military services 
our experience in the defense arena  together with our core information technology and services expertise  has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services  state  transportation and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  the environmental protection agency epa  and the library of congress 

table of contents the administration s budget proposal for fiscal year seeks to limit overall growth in the civil agency budgets to one percent per year or less 
despite this limitation on total non defense discretionary spending in the president s proposal  our key programs are well supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business 
the fiscal year budget submission for nasa is billion  million higher than the fiscal year level  and our key programs are well supported in the request 
the next generation human space flight crew transportation system  known as the crew expeditionary vehicle cev or orion  is a key element of nasa s vision for space exploration and will succeed the space shuttle in transporting a new generation of human explorers to and from space 
orion is supported at a level of billion in the budget proposal for nasa 
though we have continued to receive new orders from the us military in for satellites to support missile defense  battlefield communications and other defense initiatives  the environment for our commercial satellites business continues to be very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry 
we are managing our commercial satellite business with an expectation of receiving fewer orders due to market constraints 
the department of homeland security fiscal year budget request of billion is an increase of over fiscal year enacted level 
within the budget  the coast guard deepwater system is funded at million 
despite overall decreases in the total budgets for the departments of transportation and justice  the transportation workers identity card twic program  the federal aviation administration s automated flight services station network  and the federal bureau of investigation s sentinel program are well supported in their respective agency budgets 
other key programs are well supported in the civil agency budgets 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management and e government solutions for our customers  including the social security administration and the epa  as well for the dod 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance and enterprise solutions 
the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public private competitions 
in addition  recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions 
as a result  we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies 
in addition  the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports  waterways and cargo security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  employee identification and credential verification systems  information systems security  and other global security systems solutions 
in addition  we may see an increase in demand from the department of state and the united nations for mission services  global security and stability operations  and facility services 
similar to the risks inherent in our defense business  funding for our civil agency business is contingent on approval in annual appropriations acts for each of the agencies with which we have business 
major programs may be funded over several annual government budget cycles  with the risk of future reductions or elimination in the administration s budget review or in the annual congressional appropriations process 
in the civil government business  some risks are unique to particular programs 
for example  although indemnification by the us government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses  us government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes 
in addition  there are some instances where the us government could provide indemnification under applicable law  but elects not to do so 
while we maintain insurance for some business risks  it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities 
we generally seek  and in certain cases have obtained  limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of safety act qualification is less useful in mitigating potential liability for international applications of our homeland security products and services 
where we are unable to secure indemnification or qualification under the safety act or choose not to do so  we may nevertheless elect to provide the product or service when we think the related risks are manageable or when emergency conditions relative to national security make qualification impracticable 

table of contents other business considerations we have continued the expansion of our business with foreign governments primarily through aeronautics  electronic systems and with is gs acquisition of pae in our international sales are comprised of foreign military sales through the us government and direct commercial contracts 
in aeronautics  the us government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design  testing and production of the f lightning ii 
the f fighting falcon has been selected by countries  with follow on buys from customers 
the c j super hercules air mobility aircraft is currently in service in four foreign countries  and is expanding its international footprint with recent orders from canada and norway 
with regard to the aegis weapon system  our electronic systems segment performs activities in the development  production  ship integration and test  and lifetime support for ships of international customers eg  japan  korea and spain 
electronic systems also produces the pac missile  an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats  for international customers including japan  germany and the netherlands 
the acquisition of pae has increased our presence in certain less developed countries by providing base camp construction  logistics  democratization and management services  among others  generally through our contracts with such customers as the united nations and the us department of state 
as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty  based on current facts  we do not believe that any of the claims  audits or investigations pending against us are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in years in which an appropriations bill has not been signed into law before september the end of the us government s fiscal year  congress typically passes a continuing resolution that authorizes us government agencies to continue to operate  generally at the same funding levels from the prior year  but does not authorize new spending initiatives 
during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed  we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding  and those delays may affect our revenue and profit during the period 
we are exposed to risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties  dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers  and obsolescence  as well as congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
many of our programs involve the development and application of state of the art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks  delays  cost growth and product failures can occur 
we have entered into various joint ventures  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business  since their activities are closely aligned with our operations 
for example  we have a equity interest in united launch alliance  llc ula  which provides the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches on atlas and delta launch vehicles  and a equity interest in united space alliance  llc usa which provides ground processing and other operational services to the space shuttle program 
certain of our business arrangements include international partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the us department of state and the department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in august  the president signed into law legislation related to pension plan funding in response to the public s concern over the adequacy of such funding 
the law has the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the internal revenue code that most companies will be required to pay  effective in the legislation provides an exemption for us as well as other large us defense contractors that delays the requirement to accelerate funding 
the legislation also requires the us government cost accounting standards cas board to modify its 
table of contents pension accounting rules by to better align the recovery of pension contributions on us government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements 
the new funding requirements for large us defense contractors will be delayed until the earlier of or the year in which the changes to the cas rules are effective 
critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition approximately of our sales are derived from long term contracts for design  development and production activities  with the remainder attributable to contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design  development or production activities 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
accounting for design  development and production contracts generally  we record long term  fixed price design  development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our c j tactical transport aircraft program and multiple launch rocket system program 
for certain other long term  fixed price design  development and production contracts that  along with other factors  require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract  sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
as examples  we use this methodology for our f raptor program and the aegis weapon system program 
in some instances  long term production programs may require a significant level of development and or a low rate of initial production units in their early phases  but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later  full rate production stages 
in those cases  the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost to cost method to the units of delivery method as new contracts for different phases of a program are received after considering  among other factors  program and production stability 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record sales and an estimated profit 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
examples of this type of revenue recognition include the f lightning ii joint strike fighter system development and demonstration sdd program and the thaad missile defense program 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government ie  foreign military sales 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
incentives and award fees related to performance on design  development and production contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs 
such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 

table of contents products and services provided under long term design  development and production contracts represent approximately of our sales for therefore  the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all design  development and production contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
accounting for services contracts revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design  development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
this methodology is mainly used by our is gs segment 
services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  except that initial set up costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
earnings related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
incentives and award fees related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable  generally at the date of award 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  interest expense  and public relations are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under sales and earnings in note to the financial statements 
postretirement benefit plans most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans  and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees 
our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans 
this is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
non union represented employees hired after january  do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans  but are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans 
they also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans  but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation 
we account for our pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r and fas  employers accounting for pensions 
fas  which we adopted as of december   required us to recognize on a plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
prior to the end of  
table of contents unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs were netted against the plans funded status on our balance sheet in accordance with fas the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation pbo of the plan 
fas requires that the amounts we record  including the expense or income for the plans  be computed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the key year end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in future compensation levels  with the more subjective of these being the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and  in the case of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  past investment experience  judgments about future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
the discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the pbo at the end of the year as well as the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year 
we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
these items include quoted rates from long term bond indices and changes in long term bond rates over the past year 
at the close of  the annualized merrill lynch index for long term aa corporate bonds years was 
we also calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected pension related cash flows 
our pension related cash flows are put into actuarial models that included data for corporate bonds rated aa or better 
the available universe of bonds are adjusted to reflect call provisions  outstanding issue amount  and bonds that are considered outliers 
as of december   the actuarial models calculated rates ranging from to 
the data we collect provides important inputs into our determination of an appropriate discount rate 
after reviewing all of the above data  we determined that the most appropriate discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations as of december  would be  compared to used at the end of the discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment 
a reasonably possible change of plus or minus basis points in the discount rate assumption at december   with all other assumptions held constant  would decrease or increase the amount of the projected benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately million  resulting in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholders equity at the end of the year of approximately million 
if the discount rate at december  that was used to compute pension expense had been basis points higher or lower  with all other assumptions held constant  the amount of expense recorded would have been lower or higher by approximately million 
the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested  or to be invested  to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation 
this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns  the anticipated long term allocation of plan assets  the historical return data for the trust funds  plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns 
the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption  but the average expected return over a long term future horizon should be approximated by the assumption  therefore  changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate 
any variance in a given year should not  by itself  suggest that the assumption should be changed 
patterns of variances should be reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
we record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in note to the financial statements 
judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed  complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  cost allowability issues  agreements among prps to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below and other factors 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees which document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation 
we are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal 
table of contents agreements exist  but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually cover several years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation  and evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions  which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site 
we record a liability for the amount within the range which we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or  in cases where no amount within the range is better than another  we record an amount at the low end of the range 
we review the estimates periodically and make adjustments to reflect changes in facts and circumstances 
given the required level of judgment and estimation  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
under agreements reached with the us government  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our net sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million 
about of the liability relates to former operating sites in redlands and burbank  california  mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
the remainder of the liability relates to other properties including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we have recorded assets totaling million at december  for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services to agencies of the us government 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales 
any recoveries we receive from other prps or insurance would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future us government net sales and cost of sales 
goodwill impairment in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit 
the assessment is performed at the reporting unit level which we generally define as the business segment level or one level below the business segment 
our annual testing date is october performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology which requires significant judgment  including estimation of future cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  general market conditions and the determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 

table of contents our goodwill at december  amounted to billion 
we completed our assessment of goodwill as of october  and determined that no impairment existed at that date 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at october  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation under the provisions of fas r  share based payments 
we recognize compensation cost related to all share based payments  including restricted stock units rsus and stock options 
compensation cost for rsus is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the award 
we estimate the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
our stock options do not include market or performance conditions 
we generally recognize the compensation cost for rsus and stock options ratably over a three year vesting period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining certain inputs to the model  including a volatility factor for our stock  an expected life of the option and a risk free interest rate 
we estimate volatility based on the historical volatility of our daily stock price over the past five years  which is commensurate with the expected life of the options 
we base the average expected life on the contractual term of the stock option  historical trends in employee exercise activity and post vesting employment termination trends 
we analyzed the option exercise patterns of our employees and determined there are no significant differences between employee groups 
we base the risk free interest rate on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we also are required to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant which we base on historical experience 
if any of our estimates or assumptions used in the black scholes model were to change significantly  stock based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from the amount recorded in compensation cost recognized in totaled million 
acquisition and divestiture activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this not only internally  through our independent research and development activities  but also through acquisitions 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
we have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses during the past several years 
over the last five years  we have paid billion to complete such acquisitions 
conversely  we may also explore the divestiture of businesses  investments and real estate 
if we were to decide to sell any such assets  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are completed and losses  if any  would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired 
acquisitions we used approximately million in for acquisition activities including the acquisition of  among others  management systems designers inc msd  a provider of information technology it and scientific solutions supporting government life science  national security  and other civil agency missions 
the amount also includes certain payments related to acquisitions completed in prior years 
the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in in and  we completed acquisitions of the following businesses year ended december  pacific architects and engineers  inc  a provider of services to support military readiness  peacekeeping missions  nation building activities  and disaster relief services included in our is gs segment  savi technology  inc  a developer of active radio frequency identification solutions included in our is gs segment  aspen systems corporation  an information management company that delivers a range of business process and technology solutions included in our is gs segment  isx corporation  a provider of military decision systems and other information technology solutions included in our electronic systems segment  and hmt vehicles  a military vehicle design company included in our electronic systems segment 
year ended december  the sytex group  inc  a provider of information technology solutions and technical support services included in our is gs segment  
table of contents stasys limited  a uk based technology and consulting firm specializing in network communications and defense interoperability included in our is gs segment  insys group limited  a uk based diversified supplier of military communications systems  weapons systems and advanced analysis services included in our electronic systems segment  and coherent technologies  inc  a supplier of high performance  laser based remote sensing systems included in the space systems segment 
the aggregate cash paid for the acquisitions  as well as for amounts paid in related to acquisitions completed in  was billion 
the aggregate cash paid for the acquisitions  as well as for amounts paid in related to acquisitions completed in prior periods  was million 
we accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations in or divestitures during  and  we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments and real estate by divesting of the following year ended december  our remaining interest in comsat international  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  and certain land in california  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share

the gain on the sale was deferred pending the disposition of guarantees associated with providing launch services for certain customers see note  million shares of inmarsat plc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  the assets of space imaging  llc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  and certain land in california and florida  which resulted in an aggregate gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share 
year ended december  our interest in neustar  inc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  million of our inmarsat plc shares for million 
in addition  primarily as a result of a successful initial public offering by inmarsat  we recognized a gain of million which had previously been deferred 
together  these transactions resulted in gains  net of state income taxes  totaling million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share  and our interest in intelsat  ltd  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income expense  net  and increased net earnings by million per share 
united launch alliance on december   we completed the formation of ula see note with the boeing company boeing 
the net book value of the assets we contributed and the liabilities that ula assumed from us was initially determined to be million as of the date of closing 
we accounted for the transfer at net book value  with no gain or loss recognized 
in july  we reached agreement with boeing with respect to resolution of the final working capital and the value of the launch vehicle support contracts that we each contributed to form ula  as contemplated by the original agreements 
in connection with the resolution agreements  we made additional contributions to ula in respect of the working capital adjustment totaling million which resulted in an increase in our investment in ula 
ula also conformed the accounting policies of the contributed businesses 
the adoption of conformed accounting policies affected the book value of the assets and liabilities that each of us contributed and resulted in adjustments to ula s balance sheet as of december  after the agreement was implemented and the adjustments were recorded  our ownership share of ula s net assets exceeded the book value of our investment by approximately million  which we are recognizing ratably over years 
table of contents as equity in net earnings losses of equity investees in other income expense  net 
our investment in ula totaled million and million at december  and ula did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows in results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded net sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a per diluted share basis 
net sales in billions logo the following discussion of net sales and operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our statement of earnings 
the discussion of business segments which follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated net sales and operating profit for  and we follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business  and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services 
product sales are predominantly generated in the aeronautics  electronic systems and space systems segments  while most of our services revenues are generated in our is gs segment 
for  net sales were billion  a increase over sales 
sales for were billion  a increase over sales 
sales increased during in all segments as compared to except for anticipated reductions at aeronautics  sales increased in all segments in as compared to the us government is our largest customer  accounting for about of our sales in  in  and in other income expense  net was million for compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to gains recognized in from the sale of shares of inmarsat and assets of space imaging  offset partially by increased equity earnings in affiliates in other income expense  net increased million from to due to higher equity earnings in affiliates and gains from the sale of land in effective january   we adopted fas r  share based payments  and related rules  on a modified prospective basis see note 
under this method  we recognize compensation cost related to the estimated fair value of nonvested stock options and restricted stock granted in and prior years 
prior to january   we measured compensation cost for stock options using the intrinsic value method  but disclosed the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized based upon the fair value based method 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock totaling million and million which is included in the statement of earnings in cost of sales 
the net impact to earnings was million per share and million per share 
compensation cost related to restricted stock in was not material 
as of december   we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
state income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and  under us government regulations  are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the us government 
therefore  a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net sales and cost of sales 
as a result  the impact on our operating profit of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this form k is disclosed net of state income taxes 

table of contents our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to operating profit increased across all business segments in both comparative periods and was also favorably impacted by lower unallocated corporate costs  primarily due to a decline in the fas cas pension adjustment 
interest expense for was million  million lower than this decrease was mainly driven by lower interest expense associated with the september debt exchange 
interest expense for was million  million lower than in this decrease in interest expense primarily was due to reductions in our debt outstanding 
other non operating income expense  net totaled million in  an increase of from  and was million in  an increase of from the increase in was mainly due to the million of debt exchange expenses recorded in  as there were no comparable charges in the increase in over primarily was attributable to higher interest rates and amounts invested 
our effective tax rates were for  for  and for the effective rates for all years were lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax deductions for us manufacturing activities  dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan  and research and development r d tax credits 
in addition  the rate for reflected a reduction in income tax expense of million related to the completion of an irs audit in the first quarter 
the rate for reflected a reduction in income tax expense of million related to a refund claim for additional extraterritorial income exclusion eti benefits in prior years recognized in the third quarter of the rates in and also reflected tax benefits related to eti 
the increase in the effective tax rate when compared to is primarily the result of the elimination of the extraterritorial tax benefits in  partially offset by additional tax benefits resulting from a statutory increase in us manufacturing benefits  new legislation that provided enhanced r d tax credits  and the favorable closure of an irs audit 
the small decrease in the tax rate when compared to is primarily the result of higher extraterritorial tax benefits in resulting from a refund claim for additional prior year benefits 
net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the sixth consecutive year 
we reported net earnings of billion per share in  net earnings of billion per share in  and net earnings of billion per share in discussion of business segments in february  we announced a realignment of our operations to enhance support for critical customer missions and increase our integration of resources 
the realignment included the combination of our it gs and is s business segments into a new business segment named is gs  along with certain other changes 
we now operate in four principal business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  is gs and space systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the design  research and development  systems integration  production  sustainment  support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft  air vehicles and related technologies  primarily for us and allied country military services 
combat aircraft programs include the f  f and f aircraft 
the f lightning ii is currently in the system development and demonstration phase and has entered low rate production 
aeronautics has been producing f raptors since  and delivered to the us air force in  bringing the total deliveries to we also received a aircraft multi year contract for production lots  and a total of f fighting falcons were delivered in worldwide  bringing the total deliveries to  sales at aeronautics are expected to decline in primarily due to a projected reduction in f activities 
in the area of air mobility  we produce the c j super hercules aircraft 
we delivered aircraft in a total of have been ordered and delivered through in addition to aircraft production  the segment provides logistics support  sustainment  and upgrade modification and services for its aircraft 
the electronic systems business segment is engaged in the design  research  development  integration  production and sustainment of high performance systems and subsystems for undersea  shipboard  land and airborne applications  including tactical missiles  surface ship and submarine combat systems  ground combat vehicle integration and radars  among others 
with such a broad portfolio of products and services  many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules 
this business segment has continued to expand its core competencies 
table of contents as a leading systems integrator 
some of its more significant programs  including the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  the vh presidential helicopter  the aegis weapon system and the arrowhead fire control system for the apache helicopter  demonstrate the diverse products and services electronic systems provides 
the is gs business segment combines a full range of information competencies with a global delivery capability 
the segment provides full life cycle support and expertise in the areas of software and systems engineering  including in space  air and ground systems  and provides logistics  mission operations support  peacekeeping and nation building services for a wide variety of us defense and civil government agencies 
key programs and activities include the transformational communications milsatcom mission operations segment tmos program  the faa automated flight service station afss program and a number of task order vehicles indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts in our information technology line of business 
we expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies 
the space systems business segment is engaged in the design  research  development  engineering and production of satellites for both government and commercial customers  strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems 
through ownership interests in two joint ventures  the segment also includes space shuttle processing activities and expendable launch services for the us government 
government satellite programs include the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  the mobile user objective system muos  the global positioning system gps and the space based infrared system sbirs 
strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program 
space transportation includes the nasa orion program 
in the following table of financial data  total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount 
the reconciling item unallocated corporate expense  net includes the fas cas pension adjustment see the discussion of postretirement benefit plans under critical accounting policies  costs for stock based compensation programs  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  and corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments  as well as other miscellaneous corporate activities 
since the activities of the investees in which certain business segments hold equity interests are closely aligned with the operations of those segments  the equity earnings losses from those investees are included in the operating profit of the respective segments 
this table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total 
for all years presented  interest income has been reclassified from segment operating profit and unallocated corporate income expense  net to other non operating income expense  net to conform to the consolidated statement of earnings presentation see note 
in  we reclassified million  including million from unallocated corporate expense  net and million from across the business segments 
in  we reclassified million  including million from unallocated corporate expense  net and million from across the business segments

table of contents the following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment 
total negotiated backlog was approximately billion and billion at december  and this amount included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
therefore  due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments  the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs 
the following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note to the financial statements 
in our discussions of comparative results  changes in net sales and operating profit are generally expressed in terms of volume and or performance 
volume refers to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels  deliveries or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimated profit rate at completion for a particular contract for design  development and production activities 
changes in segment operating profit are also expressed in terms of performance 
performance generally refers to changes in contract profit rates at completion 
these changes on our contracts for products usually relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating or award fee performance on a particular contract 
changes in estimates of net sales and operating profit on contracts for products are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
segment operating profit in millions logo aeronautics aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for aeronautics increased by in compared to the increase in net sales was due to growth in other aeronautics programs and combat aircraft  which were offset partially by declines in air mobility 
other aeronautics programs increased million primarily due to higher volume in sustainment services activities 
combat aircraft sales increased million mainly due to volume increases on the f program that more than offset declines on f programs 
these increases were offset partially by a million decline in air mobility sales due to lower volume on c programs 
net sales for aeronautics decreased by in compared to the anticipated decline in net sales was due to a decline in air mobility sales that was offset partially by increases in combat aircraft and other aeronautics programs sales 

table of contents air mobility sales declined by million primarily due to c j deliveries in compared to in and lower volume on the c program 
combat aircraft sales increased by million mainly due to higher f and f volume  partially offset by reduced volume on f programs 
other aeronautics programs sales increased by million primarily due to higher volume in sustainment services activities 
operating profit for the segment increased in compared to operating profit increases in combat aircraft more than offset decreases in other aeronautics programs and air mobility 
combat aircraft operating profit increased million mainly due to improved performance on f and f programs 
air mobility and other aeronautics programs declined million due to lower operating profit in support and sustainment activities 
operating profit for the segment increased in compared to operating profit increased in both combat aircraft and air mobility 
combat aircraft increased million  mainly due to higher volume on the f and f programs  and improved performance on f programs 
the improvement for the year was also attributable in part to the fact that in  operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the f program 
air mobility operating profit increased million  mainly due to improved performance on c j sustainment activities in backlog decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of sales volume on the f program 
this decrease was offset partially by increased orders on the f and c j programs 
electronic systems electronic systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for electronic systems increased by in compared to sales increased in missiles fire control m fc  maritime systems sensors ms  and platform  training energy pt e

table of contents information systems global services information systems global services operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for is gs increased by in compared to during the year  sales increased in global services  information systems  and mission solutions 
global services sales increased million due to higher volume and growth in mission services activities including the impact of the acquisition of pae in september information systems sales increased million due to growth in information technology and the acquisition of msd in february higher volume in mission and combat support activities accounted for the majority of the million sales increase at mission solutions 
net sales for is gs increased by in compared to during the year  sales increases in global services and mission solutions more than offset declines in information systems 
global services sales increased million primarily due to higher volume in mission services activities and the acquisition of pae 
information systems sales decreased million primarily due to lower volume in information technology activities 
at mission solutions  sales increased million due to higher volume in global security solutions activities that more than offset declines in mission and combat support solutions 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to during the year  operating profit increased in all three lines of business 
mission solutions operating profit increased million due to higher volume in mission and combat support solutions and aviation solutions activities 
global services operating profit growth of million was primarily attributable to the acquisition of pae

operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to during the year  operating profit increased in all three lines of business 
higher volume in global security solutions activities accounted for the majority of the million increase in operating profit at mission solutions 
information systems operating profit increased million mainly due to improved performance in information technology and systems integration activities 
operating profit increased million in global services primarily due to the acquisition of pae 
the increase in backlog during over was due to increased orders in mission support activities and information systems programs 
space systems space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for space systems increased in compared to during the year  sales increases at satellites and strategic defensive missile systems s dms more than offset declines at space transportation 
in satellites  an increase of million was mainly driven by higher volume in government satellite activities  while commercial satellites sales remained relatively flat 
there were four commercial satellite deliveries during and five in higher volume in strategic missile programs accounted for the majority of a million increase in sales at s dms 
space transportation sales declined million 
this decline was expected given the divestiture of the international launch services business and the formation of the ula joint venture in the fourth quarter of the corporation no longer records sales on atlas launch vehicles and related support to the us government  as ula is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
this sales decline was offset partially by higher volume on the orion program 
net sales for space systems increased by in compared to during the year  sales growth in satellites and s dms offset declines in space transportation 
the billion growth in satellites sales was mainly due to higher volume 
table of contents on both government and commercial satellite programs 
there were five commercial satellite deliveries in compared to no deliveries in higher volume in both strategic missile programs accounted for the million sales increase at s dms 
in space transportation  sales declined million primarily due to lower volume in government space transportation activities on the titan and external tank programs 
increased sales on the atlas evolved expendable launch vehicle launch capabilities elc contract partially offset the lower government space transportation sales 
operating profit for the segment increased in compared to during the year  operating profit growth in satellites and s dms more than offset declines at space transportation 
satellites operating profit increased million due to improved performance in commercial and government satellite activities 
increased operating profit of million at s dms was due to higher volume and improved performance on strategic missile programs 
in space transportation  the decline of million in operating profit from was mainly due to a charge recognized by ula in the third quarter of for an asset impairment on delta ii medium lift launch vehicles 
the decline also reflects benefits recognized in from risk reduction activities  including the definitization of the elc contract  and other performance improvements on the atlas program  with no similar items recognized in the comparable period in operating profit for the segment increased in compared to operating profit increased in satellites  space transportation and s dms 
the million growth in satellites operating profit was primarily driven by the volume and performance on government satellite programs and commercial satellite deliveries 
in space transportation the million growth in operating profit was attributable to improved performance on the atlas program resulting from risk reduction activities  including the first quarter definitization of the elc contract 
in s dms  the million increase was attributable to higher volume on strategic missile programs 
under the agreement to sell our ownership interests in lkei and ils in the fourth quarter of  we continued to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ils does not refund the advance 
we expect to recognize the million deferred net gain on the transaction when our responsibility to refund the advances expires  which we generally believe will be in based on the expected proton launch schedule  which is subject to change 
our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent upon khrunichev state research and production space center khrunichev providing the contracted launch services or  in the event the launch services are not provided  ils ability to refund the advance 
our balance sheet at december  included current assets relating to lkei and ils totaling million and current liabilities totaling million  both of which will be reduced as the launch services are provided 
the assets primarily relate to advances we have made to khrunichev  the manufacturer of the launch vehicles and provider of the launch services  for future launches  and the liabilities relate primarily to advances we have received from customers for future launches 
any potential earnings impact resulting from our inability to realize the assets related to lkei and ils would be partially mitigated by our not recognizing the million deferred net gain on the transaction 
the decrease in backlog during as compared to was mainly due to sales volume related to government and commercial satellite programs  which more than offset increased orders on strategic missile programs 
unallocated corporate income expense  net the following table shows the components of unallocated corporate income expense  net 
in millions fas cas pension adjustment items not considered in segment operating performance stock compensation expense other  net the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with fas and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
because the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in a particular segment s net sales and cost of sales  the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
accordingly  the fas cas adjustment is not included in segment operating results and therefore is included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under gaap 

table of contents the following table shows the cas funding that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas expense  and the resulting fas cas pension adjustment in millions fas expense less cas expense and funding fas cas pension adjustment expense the fas expense decreased in due to an increase in the discount rate and other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets 
fas expense decreased in primarily due to the reduction in the rate of future compensation increases as well as the growth in plan assets in  including contributions we made to the pension trust 
cas are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government 
the total funding requirement for pension plans under cas in was million  which was recorded in our segment results of operations 
that amount was funded through discretionary prepayments we made to the plans in for  we expect our funding requirements and expense under cas to decrease 
also in  funding in addition to the amount calculated under cas will likely be required under internal revenue code irc rules 
any additional amounts computed under the irc rules are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules  and are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods 
in  and  we made discretionary prepayments of million  million and million to the pension trust 
prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required under the cas and irc rules and  as a result  we expect to have no required cash contributions to the pension trust in certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
for example  gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by corporate  as well as certain other corporate activities  are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments 
therefore  for purposes of segment reporting  the following items were included in unallocated corporate income expense  net for  and in millions  except per share data operating profit loss net earnings loss earnings loss per share year ended december  gain on sale of interest in comsat international gain on sale of land in california earnings from reversal of legal reserves due to settlement year ended december  gain on sale of interest in inmarsat gains on sale of land earnings from expiration of aes transaction indemnification gain on sale of space imaging s assets year ended december  gains related to inmarsat transactions gain on sale of interest in intelsat gain on sale of interest in neustar impairment charge related to a satellite the change in the other  net component of unallocated corporate income expense  net from to and from to primarily was due to lower expense associated with a number of corporate activities 

table of contents liquidity and cash flows we have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business eg  capital expenditures  independent research and development  made selective acquisitions of businesses  repurchased shares  increased our dividends and opportunistically reduced and refinanced our debt 
the following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy 
net cash provided by operating activities in millions logo operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to billion in as compared to in  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of million and lower postretirement benefit plan contributions of million as compared to this increase was offset partially by a million decrease in cash provided by operating working capital and higher net tax payments of million compared to operating working capital accounts consist of receivables  inventories  accounts payable  and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  an increase of million compared to the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of million  and also to an increase in operating working capital improvements of million compared to the remaining change in cash between the periods was due to income tax payments  postretirement benefit plan contributions  and the timing of various other operating activities 
investing activities capital expenditures capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  million in and million in we expect our capital expenditures over the next three years to exceed expenditures consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements 
acquisitions  divestitures and other activities we have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our strategic  operational and financial targets  help build a balanced portfolio and provide disciplined growth

table of contents financing activities share issuances  repurchases and dividends cash received from the issuance of our common stock during the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million 
those activities resulted in the issuance of million shares  million shares and million shares during the respective periods 
during  and  we used cash of  million   million and  million for common share repurchase activity see note 
our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock from time to time at management s discretion  including million of additional shares our board authorized for repurchase in as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares under the program  and there remained approximately million shares that may be repurchased in the future 
the payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy 
shareholders were paid cash dividends of million in  million in and million in we have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years 
we declared quarterly dividends in of per share during each of the first three quarters and per share for the last quarter  in of per share during each of the first three quarters and per share for the last quarter  and in of per share during each of the first three quarters and per share for the last quarter 
issuance and repayment of long term debt cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long term debt 
in  we repaid million of long term debt based on scheduled maturities 
during  we paid million to complete an exchange of debt and million related to scheduled debt repayments 
in  we used million of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long term debt 
capital structure and resources at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion and short term investments of million 
our long term debt  net of unamortized discounts  amounted to billion 
our long term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures 
we have billion of convertible debentures that have a floating interest rate based on libor  however  at december   we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the debentures for a fixed interest rate 
with this swap agreement  our entire long term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates 
in the fourth quarter of  the price of our common stock exceeded of the conversion price on our billion of convertible debentures for the specified period of time  and therefore holders of the debentures may elect to convert them during the quarter ending march  see note 
the right to convert the debentures based on our stock price is re evaluated each quarter 
we have irrevocably agreed to pay only cash in lieu of common stock for the accreted principal amount of the debentures relative to our conversion obligations  but have retained the right to satisfy the conversion obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash or common stock 
the conversion obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount at december  totaled approximately million 
if that amount had been settled in shares on that date  we would have been required to issue million shares of our common stock 
we have the right to redeem any or all of the debentures at any time after august  we also have outstanding million of year debentures issued in that bear interest of  the registered holders of which may elect  between march and april   to have their debentures repaid on may  we have continued to classify these debentures and the billion of convertible debentures discussed above as long term based on our ability and intent to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year 
our ability to do so is demonstrated by our billion revolving credit facility which expires in june see discussion below 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility on december  in august  we issued billion of new notes due the new notes 
the new notes were issued in exchange for certain other of our then outstanding debt securities  and cash consideration of million 
holders also received a cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest on the previous notes 
the cash consideration of million  which is included in the statement of cash flows in financing activities  is being amortized over the life of the new notes as a discount using the effective interest method and recorded in interest expense 
the new notes are included on our balance sheet net of the unamortized discount under the caption long term debt  net 
the expenses associated with the exchange  net of state income tax benefits  totaled million and were recorded in other non operating income expense  net 
they reduced net earnings in by million per share 

table of contents our stockholders equity amounted to billion at december   an increase of billion from december  the increase was due primarily to net earnings of billion  the remeasurement and recognition of prior period amounts related to our postretirement benefit plans under fas see note  which increased other comprehensive income by billion  and employee stock activity of million 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of million common shares for billion and payment of million of dividends during the year 
as we repurchase our common shares  we reduce common stock for the of par value of the shares repurchased  with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program  additional paid in capital was reduced to zero  with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of million recorded as a reduction of retained earnings 
through our debt repayment activities  our long term debt balance has declined billion over the last five years from billion at december  our debt to total capitalization ratio was at december   down from at december  the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the increase in stockholders equity discussed above 
debt to total capital ratio logo return on invested capital roic improved by basis points during to 
we define roic as net earnings plus after tax interest expense divided by average invested capital stockholders equity plus debt  after adjusting stockholders equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans  including unrecognized prior service costs  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  the adjustment for the adoption of fas in and minimum pension liability adjustments recorded in prior years 
we believe that reporting roic provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations 
we use roic to evaluate multi year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure 
we also use roic as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans 
roic is not a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
roic should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance 
see consolidated financial data five year summary on page of this form k for additional information concerning how we calculate roic 
return on invested capital ratio logo at december   we had in place a billion revolving credit facility which expires in june there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured 
table of contents and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a bank base rate as defined 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion credit facility 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of up to billion in debt securities 
if we were to issue debt under this shelf registration  we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
our management continually reviews changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs  projected over the next three years 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle tax and other liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt a interest payments b other liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures total contractual cash obligations a the total amount of long term debt excludes unamortized discounts of million see note 
b interest payments include amounts for debt outstanding through maturity except for our billion of convertible debentures  for which we have included payments through august  subsequent to that date  interest is no longer payable to holders  but rather will be included in the accreted principal of the debentures see note 
long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans  environmental liabilities and business acquisition agreements 
obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements  excluding amounts reimbursed by the us government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party 
the amounts also include liabilities related to tax positions we have taken for which we have recorded liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes see notes and 
we estimated the timing of payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities 

table of contents purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
however  the us government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience pursuant to the far 
for example  if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our us government customer and the customer terminated the contract for its convenience  any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments  as well as amounts previously incurred  would generally be reimbursed by the customer 
this would also be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign  state and local governments 
we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment at several of our locations  related to customer contracts 
we also may enter into industrial participation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
we have not been required to pay any such penalties 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   we had outstanding offset agreements totaling billion  primarily related to our aeronautics segment  that extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
in connection with the formation of ula  we and boeing each committed to provide up to million in additional capital contributions and million in other financial support to ula  as required 
the non capital financial support was required to be made in the form of a revolving credit facility between us and ula or guarantees of ula financing with third parties  in either case  to the extent necessary for ula to meet its working capital needs 
we agreed to provide this support for at least five years from december   the closing date of the transaction  and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand 
to satisfy our non capital financial support commitment  we and boeing have put into place a revolving credit agreement with ula 
at december   we had made million in payments under our capital contribution commitment  and no amounts have been drawn on the revolving credit agreement 
in addition  both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other related to certain financial support arrangements eg  letters of credit  surety bonds or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party and guarantees by us and boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ula under certain of its launch service contracts 
we believe ula will be able to fully perform its obligations  as it has done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross indemnities 

table of contents we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts 
in some cases  we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees  as follows commitment expiration by period in millions total commitment less than year a years a years after years standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately  million  million and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year  year  and year periods  and approximately million and million of surety bonds in the less than year and year periods  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were issued to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
under the agreement to sell our ownership interests in lkei and ils see note  we will continue to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ils does not refund the advance 
we expect to recognize the million deferred net gain on the transaction when our responsibility to refund the advances expires  which we currently believe will be in based on the expected proton launch schedule  which is subject to change 
the amount we could be required to pay is expected to increase over time due to the payment of additional advances by the customers to ils related to the specific launches we have guaranteed  and will be reduced by the occurrence of those launches 
at december   the total amount that could be payable under the guarantees  approximating the total contract value of the guaranteed launches  was million 
that amount may be partially mitigated by approximately million of cash we retained that  absent any requirements to make payments under the guarantees  will be paid to the buyer over time as the launches occur 
through december   proton launch services provided through ils were provided according to contract terms 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate and floating rate long term debt 
at december   we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our billion of convertible debentures based on libor for a fixed interest rate through august  with this swap agreement  our long term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates 
we have designated the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted libor based variable interest payments 
based on our evaluation at the inception of the hedging agreement and in subsequent periods  we expect the hedging relationship to be highly effective in achieving the offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged variable interest payments  resulting in a fixed net interest expense reported on the statement of earnings 
we determined that the hedging relationship remained highly effective at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date  with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was not material 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and generally do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies  or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities 
related gains and losses on these contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the 
table of contents contracts are recognized in the current period 
at december   the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding and the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended were not material 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas r  business combinations  which will become effective january  the new standard will replace existing guidance and significantly change accounting and reporting relative to business combinations in consolidated financial statements  including requirements to recognize acquisition related transaction and post acquisition restructuring costs in our results of operations as incurred 
fas r will be effective for businesses acquired after the effective date 
in september  the fasb issued fas  fair value measurements  which is effective january   with the exception of leases and certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
fas defines fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standard generally is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
we currently do not expect that the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued fas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which also becomes effective january  under fas  a company may choose to measure certain financial instruments eg  assets and liabilities and certain other items not currently subject to fair value measurement at fair value 
if so elected  any unrealized gains and losses from marking those items to market will be included in earnings in each subsequent reporting period 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with few exceptions 
we do not plan to elect the fair value option 
in september  the fasb issued a proposed rule that would change the accounting for our billion of floating rate convertible debentures 
the effect of the rule  if enacted as proposed  requires the proceeds from the debt issuance to be bifurcated between a debt and equity component as of the august issuance date 
the equity component reflects the value of the conversion feature 
the fasb currently plans to re deliberate the proposal in the first quarter of and has not indicated when it may become effective 
if approved as currently drafted  we would expect the proposed rule to result in immaterial changes to our previously reported balance sheets and statements of earnings to reflect the amortization of additional interest expense over the period from august to august controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded 
our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures  we recognize that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited in some cases  only that of a passive equity holder than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency  while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment 
changes may include such activities as implementing new  more efficient systems  consolidating the activities of two or more business units  and migrating certain processes to our shared services centers 
in addition  when we acquire new businesses  we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities 

table of contents we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  as of december  the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions  and under the supervision of the ceo and cfo 
based on our evaluation  we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december  during  we also performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  including performing self assessment and monitoring procedures 
based on those activities and other evaluation procedures  our management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  management s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page in addition  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was audited by our independent registered public accounting firm 
their report appears on page there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting
