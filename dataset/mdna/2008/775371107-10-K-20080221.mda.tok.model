item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note contingent liabilities  guarantees and commitments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
research and development we believe that one of the keys to our success is product innovation 
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development as a way to differentiate our existing products  while bringing new technologies and innovative  high value products to market 
a few examples of meaningful results from our investment are ecovance tm  which is an organic wood preservative that improves the appearance and performance of treated lumber  and replaces heavy  metal based biocides 
invinsa tm  a pre harvest application of our patented mcp technology for agronomic crops  with the potential to significantly improve yields by improving heat and drought tolerance 
avanse tm  which is a polymer technology that improves the cost performance balance of architectural paints  meets low voc requirements and allows waterborne coatings to replace solvent based metal coatings 
display films that improve the performance of lcd displays 
fast track tm  which enables quicker drying road marking paints 
aquaset tm  a water based polymer replacement for formaldehyde resins  currently used in insulation  but with the possibility for additional applications 
we believe that our many intellectual properties  both existing and in development  are of substantial value in the manufacturing  marketing and application of our various products 
as such  we allocate a significant amount of our operating budget to research and development 
historically  we have increased our annual spend from year to year 
in  total spending increased to million from million in and million in to support current growth projects 
in  we expect to spend approximately million 
over of our research and development efforts are currently focused in the electronic materials group and paint and coatings materials segments and our niche businesses 
on a consolidated basis  we are not dependent  to a material extent  upon any one trademark  patent or license  however  certain of our businesses may be so dependent 
we employ more than  technologists around the globe and a list of our technical and research centers throughout the world can be found in item properties

item a 
risk factors the factors described below represent principal risks to our business 
while we have programs in place to manage these risks we face  our results could be adversely affected by the occurrence of one or more of these factors 
changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect our financial results 
approximately of our sales are derived from outside the united states  a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies 
we have significant production facilities which are located outside of the united states 
our financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
we use certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects  but it is not cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
accordingly  reported sales  net earnings  cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
changes in global economic  political and social conditions may adversely affect our financial results 
we are active participants in the markets of north america  europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
economic and political conditions and social unrest can cause fluctuations in demand and volatility in the price of raw materials and other costs that can adversely affect our financial results 
specifically  economic conditions affecting the building and construction  electronics  packaging and paper  industrial and other  transportation  household and personal care  water and food markets could adversely affect our financial results 
as a multinational company  changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements  export controls or international tax treaties could adversely affect our financial results 
we may have to comply with unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements which could negatively impact our operations and ability to manage our global resources 
export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets 
changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations 
deliberate  malicious acts  including terrorism  could damage our facilities  disrupt our operations or injure employees  contractors  customers or the public and adversely affect our financial results 
intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain 
our facilities could be damaged or destroyed  reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at a substantial cost 
employees  contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable 
governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly 
the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our financial results 
actions by our competitors may adversely affect our financial results 
our products are sold in a competitive  global economy 
competitors include many large multinational chemical firms based in europe  asia and the united states 
new competitive products or pricing policies of our competitors can materially affect demand for and pricing of our products 
changes in demand may adversely affect our financial results 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations in demand  the effective forecasting of customer demand  the seasonal activity of certain of our businesses and weather conditions  particularly for the salt segment 
we also manufacture and sell our products to customers in industries and countries that are experiencing periods of rapid change  most notably countries in central and eastern europe  turkey  russia  latin america and the asia pacific region 
these factors can affect demand for our products and therefore may have a significant impact on financial results 
restrictions on  and increased costs of  raw material supplies and energy may adversely affect our financial results 
we purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for our businesses 
the costs of these materials and energy  in the aggregate  represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
from time to time  certain raw materials we require become limited 
it is likely this will occur again in the future 
should such limitations arise  disruptions of our supply chain may lead to higher prices and or shortages 
also  the costs of these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
while we try to increase the prices of our products to cover increases in our costs  we may not be able to raise our prices as quickly as the costs rise  if at all  as our customers may not accept these increases 
ultimately  our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials or energy to customers is greatly dependent upon market conditions and raising prices could result in a loss of sales volume 
further  increases in energy prices may increase our shipping costs 
these limitations and increased costs could adversely affect our financial results 
see additional discussion of raw materials in item production facilities are subject to operating risks and capacity limitations that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities 
production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  and environmental risks 
further  from time to time  we may experience capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  if we are unable to effectively forecast our customers demand  it could affect our ability to successfully manage operating capacity limitations 
these hazards  limitations  disruptions in supply and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results 
an incident affecting the houston ship channel area may adversely affect our financial results 
an incident affecting the houston ship channel area could materially impact our financial results as it could significantly affect both our operations because our largest plant is located there  and our sources of supply  as a large portion of our petrochemical supply is from this area 
failure to develop new technology or the development and successful implementation of new  competing technologies by our competitors could adversely affect future financial results 
if we fail to develop new technology or if our competitors successfully develop and implement new  competing technologies in the market place  our future financial results could be significantly impacted 
failure of our intellectual property protections could adversely affect future financial results 
we have invested significant resources in intellectual properties such as patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
since we depend on these intellectual resources for our financial stability and future growth  we rely on the protection that these intellectual property rights provide 
with a significant portion of our operations outside the us  we could face challenges in protecting our intellectual property and we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property overseas due to uncertainty of laws and enforcement in a number of countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights 
a loss of intellectual property protections could enhance the ability of our competitors to develop competitive products  thereby adversely affect our financial results 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to restrict the use and disclosure of our trade secrets and proprietary know how  those confidentiality agreements may be breached 
in addition  adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know how  and others could obtain knowledge of such trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
a breach of these trade secrets and know how could adversely affect our financial results 
failure to realize benefits from joint ventures  alliances or acquisitions could adversely affect future financial results 
we have entered  and in the future may enter  into arrangements with other companies to expand product offerings and to enhance our own capabilities 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures 
in certain of these ventures  we share control with third parties and run the risk of encountering differences of opinion or having difficulty in reaching consensus with respect to certain business issues 
in addition  the success of acquisitions of new technologies  companies and products  or arrangements with third parties  is not predictable and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing our objectives  or that realization may not take longer than anticipated  or that there will not be unintended adverse consequences from these actions 
these complications and issues arising from our participation in joint ventures  alliances and acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results 
environmental costs could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  safety and health laws  and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions in the air  discharges to land and water  and the generation  handling  treatment  and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials 
we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously  but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in chemical manufacturing operations 
future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
in addition  laws and regulations require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment  compliance and remediation 
these additional costs may adversely affect our financial results 
litigation results could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to litigation in the normal course of business 
in addition  we could become subject to additional claims in the future 
an adverse outcome of one or more of these litigation matters  both current and those that may affect us in the future  could adversely affect our financial results 
inability to attract  develop or retain quality employees could adversely impact our ability to achieve our objectives 
we have objectives in our businesses and regions to sustain and grow the company 
continued success in achieving the objectives of the company depends on the recruitment  development and retention of qualified employees 
without these employees  we may not be able to achieve these objectives 
any damage to our reputation could adversely affect our financial results 
maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products 
if we fail to maintain high standards for product quality  safety and integrity  our reputation could be jeopardized 
adverse publicity  whether or not valid  may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 
damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in our products for any of these reasons could adversely affect our financial results

risk factors or in our filings with the sec the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and we are a global specialty materials company that brings technology and innovation to the market to enhance the performance of end use consumer products made by our customers 
our products are sold primarily for use in the building and construction  electronics  packaging and paper  industrial and other  transportation  household and personal care  water and food markets 
our salt business has one of the most recognizable brand names in the world 
we operate seven reportable segments electronic materials group electronic technologies and display technologies  specialty materials group paint and coatings materials  packaging and building materials and primary materials  performance materials group  and salt 
a year in review represents another excellent year of performance for the company  resulting in record sales 
the results reflect the company s ability to operate in a dynamic world through superior execution of its business strategies 
significant items affecting the results of operations include the continued growth in our core businesses of the electronic materials group and paint and coatings materials  the overall acceleration of growth in the rapidly developing economies  the investment in new facilities to expand our global research  technical service and manufacturing footprint  and  the balanced deployment of cash for investment in growth initiatives  double digit dividend increase  and stock repurchases 
in  we reported sales of  million  an increase over  with reported earnings from continuing operations in of million  or per share  as compared to earnings from continuing operations of million or per share 
the increase in sales was due to the favorable performance of salt  robust demand in electronic materials and strong chemicals growth in rapidly developing economies 
the increase in sales was more than offset by deterioration in the us building and construction markets  significantly higher than anticipated raw materials  energy and freight costs  and the disappointing operating performance of our houston monomers plant  resulting in lower earnings per share 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets  liabilities and equity and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements when the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
litigation and environmental reserves we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business involving employee  personal injury  property damage and environmental matters 
additionally  we are involved in environmental remediation and spend significant amounts for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to assess these matters to determine if a liability is probable  and record such a liability when the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated 
the determination and estimation of these liabilities are critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized at the point during the remedial feasibility study when costs become probable and estimable 
we do not accrue for legal costs expected to be incurred with a loss contingency 
in reviewing such matters  we consider a broad range of information  including the claims  demands  settlement offers received from governmental authorities or private parties  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute as well as our prior experience  to determine if a liability is probable and if the value is estimable 
if both of these conditions are met  we record a reserve 
these reserves include liabilities expected to be paid out within the next years 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses  and disclose any material  reasonably possible  additional losses 
if we determine a liability to be only reasonably possible  we consider the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose any material potential liability 
in addition  estimates for liabilities to be incurred between to years in the future are also considered only reasonably possible because the chance of a future event occurring is more than remote but less than probable 
these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment 
our most significant reserves are those that have been established for remediation and restoration costs associated with environmental issues 
as of december   we have million reserved for environmental related costs 
we conduct studies and site surveys to determine the extent of environmental contamination and necessary remediation 
with the expertise of our environmental engineers and legal counsel  we determine our best estimates for remediation and restoration costs 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future costs for remediation and change periodically as additional and better information becomes available 
changes to assumptions and considerations used to calculate remediation reserves could materially affect our results of operations or financial position 
if we determine that the scope of remediation is broader than originally planned  discover new contamination  discover previously unknown sites or become subject to related personal injury or property damage claims  our estimates and assumptions could materially change 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate reserves for both our environmental and other legal liabilities are appropriate 
these estimates are based in large part on information currently available and the current laws and regulations governing these matters 
if additional information becomes available or there are changes to the laws or regulations or actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating our reserves  the resulting change could have a material impact on the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income  statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as depreciation expense 
these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in the determination of our tax provision  we have recorded deferred income taxes on income from foreign subsidiaries which have not been reinvested abroad permanently as upon remittance to the united states such earnings are taxable 
for foreign subsidiaries where earnings are permanently reinvested outside the united states  no additional united states income taxes have been provided 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are subject to audit within these jurisdictions 
as a result  in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we assess our income tax positions and record accruals for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we adjust these accruals  if necessary  upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 
since significant judgment is required to assess the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  the ultimate resolution of these events could result in adjustments to our financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
therefore  we consider such estimates to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the current year accrued and deferred tax positions are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
restructuring when appropriate  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our manufacturing footprint and support service functions 
to the extent that exact amounts are not determinable  we have established reserves for such initiatives by calculating our best estimate of employee termination costs utilizing detailed restructuring plans approved by management 
reserve calculations are based upon various factors including an employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary level and health care benefit choices 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to calculate these restructuring provisions are appropriate  and although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs could differ from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating reserves should changes be made in the nature or timing of our restructuring plans 
the resulting change could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings and equipment  long term investments  goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in addition  changes in the expected useful life of these long lived assets may also be an impairment indicator 
as a result  future decisions to change our manufacturing footprint or exit certain businesses could result in material impairment charges 
when such events or changes occur  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the assets use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that we must estimate include assumptions regarding sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic factors 
these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test for recoverability  we typically utilize discounted estimated future cash flows to measure fair value for each reporting unit 
this calculation is highly sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit and the discount rate assumed in these calculations 
these components are discussed below estimated future cash flows the key variables that we must estimate to determine future cash flows include assumptions for sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
for example  unanticipated changes in competition  customer sourcing requirements and product maturity would all have a significant impact on these estimates 
discount rate we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company  and therefore are beyond our control 
the average wacc utilized in our annual test of goodwill recoverability in may was  which was based upon average business enterprise value 
a increase in the wacc will result in an approximate decrease in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
a decrease in the wacc will result in an approximate increase in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
the following table summarizes the major factors that influenced the rate risk free rate of return cost of debt market risk premium the decrease in the risk free rate of return is due to the overall decrease in us long term interest rates between the dates of our annual impairment testing in may and may in the second quarter of and  we completed our annual fas impairment review and determined that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired as of may  and we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used in the above estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
a material adverse change in the estimated future cash flows of our business or significant increases in the wacc rate could result in the fair value falling below the book value of its net assets 
this could result in a material impairment charge 
the fair values of our long term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest  as well as the volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of these investment entities 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record impairment charges 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used to measure the plan obligations of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans  post retirement benefits  post employment benefits eg  medical  disability and other employee liabilities 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  the expected long term rate of return on assets  increases or trends in health care costs  and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
management reviews these assumptions at least annually and updates the assumptions as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis 
the discount rates for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans are determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation  discounting those expected payments using a zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds rated aa or better by moody s investor services as of the measurement date  and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that results in the same projected benefit obligation 
our calculation excludes bonds with explicit call schedules and bonds which are not frequently traded 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our estimates of long term returns on major asset categories  such as fixed income and equity securities  and our actual allocation of pension investments among these asset classes 
in determining our long term expected rate of return  we take into account long term historical returns  historical performance of plan assets  the expected value of active investment management  and the expected interest rate environment 
in determining annual expense for the us  canada  and uk pension plans  we use a market related value of assets rather than the fair value 
the market related value of assets is a smoothed actuarial value of assets equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income or loss is recognized over a five year period 
accordingly  changes in the fair market value of assets are not immediately reflected in our calculation of net periodic pension cost 
for our other plans  net periodic pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets 
we believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate in the current economic environment 
however  if economic conditions change  we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions  and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the balance sheets 
at each measurement date  gains and losses from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions are calculated 
if this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in pension expense for the following year 
the weighted average discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the estimated return on plan assets used in our determination of plan obligations and pension expense are as follows weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation for years ended december  us us us us discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for years ended december  us us us us us us discount rate estimated return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the following illustrates the annual impact on pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the assumptions used to determine the net cost for the year ending december  combined weighted average discount estimated return on increase decrease rate plan assets pension expense in millions us us us us us non us basis point increase basis point decrease the following illustrates the annual impact on postretirement benefit expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the discount rate used to determine the net cost for the year ending december  weighted average discount rate in millions us us basis point increase basis point decrease share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimation of the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected dividends  and risk free interest rates 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
reportable segments at december  we operate seven reportable segments  as presented below 
additional information regarding the markets these segments serve can be found in item business 
our sales and earnings by reportable operating segment and region are presented below 
net sales north segment in millions america europe asia pacific latin america eliminations total electronic technologies display technologies electronic materials group paint and coatings materials packaging and building materials primary materials segment eliminations specialty materials group performance materials group salt total in millions net earnings from continuing operations electronic technologies display technologies electronic materials group paint and coatings materials packaging and building materials primary materials specialty materials group performance materials group salt corporate total note the results for the year ended december  have been reclassified to reflect automotive coatings as a discontinued operation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  through december  net sales and gross profits in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million over net sales of  million 
this increase was primarily driven by higher demand and favorable currencies 
the electronic materials group showed strong performance  with accelerating growth  particularly in the second half of the year 
the salt business showed strong performance  benefiting from favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter  as well as improved product mix and pricing management 
the specialty materials group showed strong growth in all regions outside of north america  including rapidly developing economies 
the performance materials group continued to benefit from stronger demand  particularly in the asia pacific and latin america regions  coupled with the impact of increased pricing and favorable currencies in europe  which more than offset weakness in north america 
in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million over net sales of  million 
this increase was primarily driven by higher demand and selling prices across most of our businesses  partially offset by currency 
the key driver for the growth in sales was the strength of our electronics materials group with a full year sales increase of 
in addition  other parts of our portfolio also had strong full year sales results  with paint and coatings up  performance materials up  and primary materials up 
on a full year basis  salt was down  reflecting the effects of the lower ice control sales in the first and fourth quarters of as compared to from from sales change demand volume currency selling price total change in millions gross profit as a percentage of sales gross profit for was  million  a decrease of from  million in  on higher sales 
the basis point decrease in versus gross profit margin reflects the impact of higher raw material  energy and freight costs and the poor operating performance of our houston monomer plant which more than offset increases in demand  currency and selling prices 
gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in  on higher sales 
gross profit margin increased in to from in due to higher selling prices necessary to offset higher raw material  operating and energy costs 
favorable currencies and product mix also helped margins 
in  we continue to anticipate higher and more volatile raw material and natural gas prices 
to mitigate the impact of high and volatile raw material and energy costs  we have increased selling prices  and we are exercising control over discretionary spending  and utilizing swap  option and collar contracts 
for further information regarding the impact of raw materials on our businesses  please see raw materials on page selling and administrative expense in millions selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales in  selling and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of sales as positive sales growth more than offset the million increase in costs in comparison to the increase in costs is primarily due to normal salary increases  the negative impact of currencies  costs related to the establishment of a european headquarters in switzerland  as well as additional costs resulting from acquisitions 
in  selling and administrative expense increased million or to  million from  million in the increase largely reflects increased spending to support marketing and growth initiatives as well as the establishment of our european headquarters in switzerland 
in addition  effective september   our vacation policy changed for certain us employees 
this change resulted in a million decrease  of which million  million  and million related to selling and administrative expenses  costs of goods sold  and research and development expense  respectively for the year ended december  we believe that our cost savings initiatives will continue to reduce certain administrative costs as we improve efficiencies 
however  we anticipate overall higher employee related costs in as a result of normal salary increases and the increasing rate of healthcare costs 
these increases will only partially be offset by lower pension costs  resulting from lower amortization of plan losses attributable to actuarial gains  higher discount rates  and our prior year plan contributions 
research and development expense in millions research and development expense as a percentage of sales we spent million on research and development in  representing a increase from million in in  we spent million in research and development  a increase from million in the increases reflect higher employee related costs as well as new growth initiatives in the electronic materials group  performance materials group and paint and coatings materials businesses 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on research and development 
interest expense interest expense for increased million from million during to million during the increase is primarily attributable to the issuance of new debt in september to fund a billion accelerated share repurchase coupled with an increase in effective interest rates 
interest expense for was million  representing a decrease from million in the primary reason for the decrease was due to lower levels of debt and a lower overall effective interest rate 
during  we retired the remaining million of our notes due in and billion of japanese yen denominated variable rate notes approximately million at september  
during  we retired million in us notes and exchanged million euro approximately million at december  in euro denominated notes for a more favorable effective interest rate and an extended term 
amortization of finite lived intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for  and was million  million  and million respectively 
the million increase from to is mainly due to additional amortization of intangible assets primarily resulting from the acquisition of eastman kodak company s light management film technology assets on june  and the acquisition of an interest in the skc haas display film joint venture on december  the million increase from to is primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of floralife  inc in the second quarter of amortization of intangible assets is estimated to be approximately million in restructuring and asset impairments in millions severance and employee benefits net asset impairments  net of gains on sales other  including contract lease termination penalties amount charged to earnings restructuring and asset impairments by business segment in millions business segment electronic technologies display technologies electronic materials group paint and coatings materials packaging and building materials primary materials specialty materials group performance materials group salt corporate total severance and employee benefits for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of expense for severance and associated employee benefits  primarily associated with the elimination of positions as part of our on going efforts to reposition our business portfolio for accelerated growth by exiting non strategic business lines  as well as to improve operating excellence through productivity initiatives in manufacturing  research and development  and business services 
reducing the effect of the charge were favorable adjustments of million for severance and employee benefits due to fewer employee separations than originally anticipated related to and initiatives 
the cost savings initiatives are expected to yield pre tax savings of approximately million annually 
of the initial positions identified  we reduced the total number of positions to be affected by these initiatives by to positions in total 
as of december   positions have been eliminated 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of expense for severance and associated employee benefits associated with the elimination of positions  primarily in our paint and coatings materials  performance materials and salt segments  concentrated in north america  and several north american support services functions 
our management approved restructuring initiatives to implement organizational alignments to support our vision strategy and to further improve the efficiency of our manufacturing network 
the organizational alignments included a more streamlined business structure  and deployment of resources to higher growth markets 
the restructuring charge resulted from efficiency initiatives in north american chemical and salt businesses 
the staffing reductions related to several of our manufacturing operations and were a direct result of changes in the execution of existing processes and productivity improvements  while support services staffing reductions were made possible as we continued to capitalize on the enhancements achieved through the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
this charge was partially offset by million of favorable adjustments to adequately reflect changes in estimates of remaining obligations related to severance payments within our global graphic arts business within our packaging and building materials segment  an initiative announced in the first quarter of additionally  there were favorable adjustments of million related to severance and employee benefits due to fewer employee separations than originally anticipated offset by million for lease contract obligations related to our  and prior initiatives 
the restructuring initiatives are expected to yield pre tax savings of million annually 
of the initial positions identified  we reduced the total number of positions by to positions in total 
as of december   positions have been eliminated 
for the year ended december   our management approved restructuring initiatives to further improve the efficiency of our manufacturing network and support organization across several of our business segments 
the restructuring initiatives involved the closing or partial shutdown of manufacturing facilities in north america  the united kingdom and germany  in addition to a north american research and development facility 
included in the net million restructuring expense for were provisions for severance and employee benefits of million for employees company wide  impacting virtually all areas including sales and marketing  manufacturing  administrative support and research personnel  and provisions for contract and lease terminations totaling million 
offsetting the charge were favorable adjustments relating to prior years restructuring reserves of million and million  primarily related to severance and employee benefits due to fewer employee separations than originally anticipated as some employees were re deployed and others filled positions left vacant through natural attrition and contract lease terminations  respectively 
the cost savings initiatives are expected to yield pre tax savings of approximately million annually 
of the initial positions identified  we reduced the total number of positions to be affected by these initiatives by to positions in total 
as of december   positions have been eliminated 
asset impairments for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of fixed asset impairment charges 
these impairments included the million write off within our corporate segment of our investment in elemica  an online chemicals e marketplace  million write off related to our digital imaging business line within our performance materials segment  million write off of in process research and development within our display technologies segment  comprised of million and million relating to the eastman kodak company light management films assets acquired and skc haas joint venture  respectively  and a million write down of an investment within our electronic technologies segment to fair market value 
these charges were offset by million in gains related to sales of previously impaired assets 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of fixed asset impairment charges associated with the restructuring of our global graphic arts business within our packaging and building materials segment 
this charge was offset by million for sales of previously impaired assets 
for the year ended december   million of asset impairment charges were recognized for the impairment of certain finite lived intangible and fixed assets across several of our chemical businesses and our component materials segment 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total asset impairment charge by million 
of the total impairment charge  million pertained to the impairment of fixed assets  while million was an impairment charge recorded for certain finite lived intangible assets to adjust their carrying value to their fair value 
pension judgment as discussed in note  we have recorded a non cash charge in the third quarter of for million million after tax to recognize the estimated potential impact of a court decision related to cost of living adjustments on our long term pension plan obligations 
loss on early extinguishment of debt in march  we retired million of our notes due in the retirement resulted in a loss of million 
share of affiliate earnings  net in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  an increase of million in comparison to million in the increase is primarily due to viance  the new wood joint venture in our performance materials group and increased earnings from an equity affiliate in our electronic materials group 
the viance joint venture is owned by rohm and haas and owned by chemical specialties  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of rockwood holdings  inc in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  an increase from million in the increase was primarily due to increased earnings from an equity affiliate in our electronic materials group offset by decreased earnings from affiliates in the packaging and building materials segment 
other income  net in  net other income decreased to million from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in currency losses of million offset by a decrease in interest and investment income of million and a reduction in gains on fixed asset disposals of million 
in  net other income increased to million from million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of million partially offset by an increase in currency losses of million 
year over year decrease in interest income is due to decreased average investments in money market funds and lower short term interest rates 
income taxes full year income tax expense was million  reflecting an effective tax rate of percent  as compared to million  or an effective tax rate of percent for the prior year period 
the tax benefit of the one time pension charge as well as favorable tax valuation adjustments and other credits reduced tax expense by million 
benefits from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies  refund claims and tax law changes reduced tax expense by million 
excluding these tax items  the underlying effective tax rate for the year was approximately compared to the effective rate for the same period in we anticipate that our full year tax rate will be between and in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
we adopted fin effective january  and the provisions of fin have been applied to all income tax positions commencing from that date 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin  million  has been reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of january  for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million reflecting an effective tax rate from continuing operations of compared to million or a effective rate for earnings in benefits of the favorable resolution of tax contingencies  refund claims and tax law changes reduced tax expense by million 
during the second quarter of  we recorded net tax reserve and valuation allowance reversals of million resulting from the favorable resolution of prior period tax contingencies due to the completion of prior years tax audits 
in addition  we recorded changes in valuation allowances and increases in tax reserves for other contingencies 
the decreases in the effective tax rates year over year were primarily due to the impact of the changes described above as well as lower taxes on foreign earnings resulting from the increase in foreign tax credits and the permanent reinvestment of certain entities outside the us of foreign earnings  for which no us tax has been provided 
results of operations for the years ended december  through december  by business segment electronic materials group the electronic materials group comprises two reportable segments which provide materials for use in applications such as telecommunications  consumer electronics and household appliances 
overall sales for this group were up in over the prior year 
sales growth was weak in the first half due to an industry wide slowdown in semiconductor production  but rebounded strongly beginning in the second half of the year 
earnings for were up over the prior year for this group 
overall sales for the electronic materials group increased over the prior year period on strong demand across all businesses  especially in north america and asia 
earnings in were up over the results for the electronic materials group are reported under the two separate reportable segments as follows electronic technologies net sales in for the electronic technologies business reached  million  up  or million  versus net sales of  million in demand was strong across all businesses  especially in asia pacific 
sales in advanced technology product lines were up versus the prior year 
sales from semiconductor technologies grew over the prior year period  reflecting continued strength in sales of chemical mechanical planarization cmp pads and slurries as well as advanced photoresists and related products 
circuit board technologies sales grew as solid growth in asia more than offset weaker demand in north america and europe 
sales of photovoltaic products  primarily in europe  began to gain traction this year 
packaging and finishing technologies sales were up only slightly versus last year as lower volumes of precious metal sales in north america offset higher process sales 
full year earnings of million were up significantly from the million earned in  reflecting increased sales of advanced technology products  mostly in asia  and continued discipline in cost management 
net sales in for the electronic technologies business were  million  up  or million  versus net sales of  million in demand was strong across all businesses  especially in asia and north america 
sales in advanced technology product lines were up versus the prior year 
sales for semiconductor technologies grew in  reflecting continued strength in sales of cmp pads and slurries in all regions along with strong sales of advanced photoresists and related products both in asia pacific and north america 
solid growth in asia more than offset weaker demand in north america and generally flat conditions in europe 
the circuit board technologies business grew overall in  mainly driven by strength in the asia pacific region 
packaging and finishing technologies sales growth of was driven by both asia pacific and north america  with precious metal pass through sales up significantly due to higher raw material prices 
process sales grew year over year 
full year earnings of million were up significantly from the million earned in  reflecting increased sales of advanced technology products and continued discipline in cost management 
earnings included a million  after tax  gain from the reversal of restructuring reserves  earnings included million  after tax  for restructuring charges 
display technologies in june  we acquired the net assets of eastman kodak company s light management films technology business  which produces advanced films that improve the brightness and efficiency of liquid crystal displays lcd 
in late november  we completed the formation of skc haas display films  a joint venture with skc incorporated of south korea for the development  manufacture and marketing of advanced optical and functional films used in the flat panel display industry 
these new businesses  along with process related materials also used in the flat panel display industry and previously included as part of our semiconductor technologies unit  form the reportable segment now referred to as display technologies 
net sales in for display technologies were million  primarily reflecting the partial year results of the newly acquired assets and joint venture referred to above 
net sales in  which include only sales of process related materials previously included as part of semiconductor technologies  were million 
the segment reported a net loss of for  reflecting the development stage nature of the newly acquired light management films technologies  as well as acquisition and purchase accounting related charges  including the write off of million  after tax  related to in process research and development costs 
sales in were million  flat against the prior year 
earnings were million down from million in specialty materials group the specialty materials group comprises three reportable segments that represent the majority of the company s chemicals business  serving a broad range of end use markets 
overall sales for this group after intersegment elimination were up in over the prior year  due to favorable currencies and increased demand 
earnings for were down from the prior year for this group 
increased sales were more than offset by higher raw material costs  unexpected operating difficulties at our houston manufacturing facility and slowed demand in the us we experienced strong growth in the first three quarters of the year and moderating growth in the fourth quarter of overall sales after intersegment elimination for the specialty materials group increased over the prior year period due mainly to higher selling prices  offset slightly by lower overall demand 
earnings in were up over the results for specialty materials group are reported under the three separate reportable segments as follows paint and coatings materials in  net sales from our paint and coatings materials segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in favorable currencies as well as strong demand  sustained across all regions other than the us  and slightly higher pricing more than offset the slowed demand in the us the slowed demand in the us was due to weakness in the architectural paint market reflecting the pronounced slowdown in home improvements as well as lower existing and new home sales 
in the fourth quarter  demand in europe also moderated while rapidly developing economies showed strong growth 
earnings were million in versus prior year earnings of million 
this decrease in earnings was driven by the unfavorable impact of lower demand in the us combined with higher raw material and operating costs  partially offset by favorable currencies  higher selling prices and demand growth in other regions 
in  net sales from our paint and coatings materials segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in the sales increase was driven by higher demand  selling prices and growth in all regions  led by growth in the rapidly developing economies of china  india  turkey  eastern europe  southeast asia and latin america 
in the decorative coatings markets  we saw strong acceptance of our differentiated low voc emulsion products for paint applications 
earnings from continuing operations were million in versus prior year earnings of million 
the favorable impact of higher volume and selling prices was largely offset by increases in raw material and operating costs  along with increases in selling and research expenses to drive growth initiatives 
packaging and building materials in  net sales from our packaging and building materials segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in the increase reflects the impacts of strong european currencies and higher pricing partially offset by lower demand 
while rapidly developing economies showed strong growth year over year  economic softness in the us building and construction markets and some soft spots in western europe more than offset the demand growth 
the overall lower demand is mainly the result of softness in the vinyl siding and windows profile markets in north america that use our plastics additives products and paper products in western europe 
earnings of million were down versus earnings of million for  a decrease of million  or 
results included a million  after tax  charge primarily for restructuring and other one time costs related to our graphic arts business 
the earnings decline reflects increased raw material costs and lower demand  partially offset by favorable currencies and increased selling prices 
in  net sales from our packaging and building materials segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in the increase reflects the impacts of higher pricing partially offset by lower demand 
the overall lower demand reflects prior portfolio adjustments and slowing market growth in north america as the year progressed 
earnings of million were up million versus earnings of million in the results included a charge of million  after tax  related to the impairment of the synthetic leather business and reserves for a plant closure in europe 
excluding the impairment charge  earnings declined by million  reflecting higher raw material costs  lower demand and increased operating costs  partially offset by the impact of a one time legal settlement  higher selling prices and lower selling and administrative costs 
primary materials year ended december  in millions total sales elimination of inter segment sales third party sales in  net sales for primary materials were  million  an increase of million  or  from prior year net sales of  million 
net sales for primary materials include sales to our internal downstream monomer consuming businesses  primarily paint and coatings materials and packaging and building materials  along with sales to third party customers 
sales to external customers increased to million in from million in the prior period  primarily due to a combination of higher volumes and favorable currencies  partially offset by lower selling prices 
sales to our downstream businesses were flat 
earnings of million in decreased from million in the reduction in earnings can be attributed to higher raw material costs  lower selling prices and a series of unplanned operating issues earlier this year 
the negative impact in of unexpected operating difficulties at our houston manufacturing facility is approximately million after tax 
in  net sales for primary materials were  million  an increase of million  or  from prior year net sales of  million 
sales to external customers decreased to million in from million in the prior period  primarily due to lower volumes and lower selling prices 
sales to our downstream businesses were higher due primarily to higher selling prices and slightly higher volumes 
earnings of million in decreased from million in the negative impact on earnings of lower selling prices to third party customers was partially offset by the benefits of slightly higher volumes and improved plant operations 
results in included million  after tax  for expenses associated with unplanned plant outages at our houston manufacturing facility 
we anticipate that global monomer supply will increase again during as a result of new production facilities that have come on line 
we expect the supply dynamics to continue to create downward pressure on primary materials pricing and margins in the upcoming year 
performance materials group net sales for the performance materials group reached  million for the ended december   an increase of  or million  versus sales of  million in stronger demand in the asia pacific and latin american regions  coupled with the impact of increased demand and favorable currencies in europe  more than offset overall economic weakness in north america 
net sales for process chemicals and biocides were million  an increase of  or million over sales in demand was strong across all regions except north america due to weakness in building and construction markets 
in the rapidly developing economies  particularly china and central and eastern europe and turkey  the ion exchange business saw increased demand in the industrial water treatment and mining markets 
the business also realized solid growth in new markets  such as biodiesel and potable water 
net sales for powder coatings were million  an increase of  or million over sales of million in the sales increase was driven by the impact of favorable currencies and higher pricing  partially offset by weaker demand 
net sales for the other businesses  including agrofresh  advanced materials and digital imaging  increased  or million from million in to million in this increase was mainly driven by continued growth of our patented methylcyclopropene mcp technology in agrofresh and increased demand in advanced materials 
earnings for of million include million after tax impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges  mainly associated with exiting the digital imaging business 
excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges earnings increased million  or compared to the earnings increase is due to increased demand  higher selling prices  the impact of favorable currencies  and improvement year over year in the powder coatings business 
the results include additional investment in more advanced applications in ion exchange and biocides such as bio processing  advanced water treatment and microbial protection  and the expansion of the mcp technology from our agrofresh business for additional high value applications in both horticultural and agronomic markets 
in  net sales from performance materials group of  million were up  or million  from prior year sales of  million  primarily due to increased demand and higher selling prices  partially offset by unfavorable currencies 
the strength in demand reflects improved sales in specialty products and biocides 
sales in process chemicals and biocides increased  reflecting stronger demand across all businesses and regions  as well as higher selling prices  partially offset by unfavorable currencies 
sales for powder coatings were up from  reflecting selling price increases and improved product mix  partially offset by lower demand  especially in europe 
earnings of million in were up from million in earnings include million  after tax  in restructuring charges while the comparable charges in were million  after tax 
higher selling prices and favorable operating costs more than offset higher raw material costs  increased selling  administrative and research spending to support growth initiatives 
salt for the year  net sales from salt were  million  an increase of versus prior period net sales of million 
the increase reflects a significant improvement in ice control volumes as a result of favorable weather conditions  which raised demand for highway de icing salt by  compared with mild winter conditions present in sales of consumer and industrial salt products increased by compared with last year as a result of improved demand  product line management  and mix in the consumer and industrial markets 
favorable currencies also contributed to the improvement in sales  in compared with earnings for of million increased by million  or  compared to earnings of million in earnings were largely impacted by improved demand for ice control related products 
improved demand and favorable mix in the industrial and consumer markets  as well as company wide cost improvement initiatives  also contributed to the earnings improvement compared with the prior year 
earnings in included million  after tax  in restructuring and asset impairment charges 
for the year  net sales from salt were million  a decrease of versus prior period net sales of million 
the decrease reflects a significant drop in ice control volumes in both the first and fourth quarters of as a result of mild weather conditions  which significantly lowered demand for highway de icing salt 
higher selling prices  favorable mix  and favorable currencies only partially offset the decline in ice control volume 
earnings for of million  which include million  after tax  in restructuring charges  decreased by million compared to earnings of million in earnings were largely impacted by the unseasonably mild weather and the resulting reduction in ice control volumes 
increases in distribution  production and material costs during were partially offset by the impact of improved selling prices and favorable mix 
in the second quarter of  we disclosed that we were exploring strategic options for our salt business 
while we had intended to finalize a path forward for this business by the end of  recent turmoil in the financial markets makes it likely that this will take longer than anticipated 
our decision and timing will be governed by our commitment to maximize value for our shareholders 
at this point  we are on hold pending a return to more normality in the markets 
corporate corporate after tax expense of million for the year ended december   increased from million in the prior year period primarily due to the recognition of the estimated one time non cash after tax pension charge of million 
other factors contributing to the increase were higher non recurring costs associated with establishing the european headquarters in switzerland  as well as higher interest expense due to higher effective interest rates and the issuance of billion in new debt in september of to fund an accelerated share repurchase 
for the year ended december   corporate after tax expenses were million  down from million in the change was primarily driven by lower interest expense  the absence of prior year charges for a loss on the early extinguishment of debt  an adjustment for share based compensation  lower environmental remediation charges  and higher interest income  partially offset by higher restructuring and shared service expenses  and the absence of favorable tax reserve and valuation allowance adjustments recognized in liquidity and capital resources overview early in the third quarter of  both management and the board of directors re evaluated our financial policies 
through the second quarter of  our policy was to maintain credit ratios consistent with an a rating 
effective with the beginning of the third quarter of  we have shifted away from targeting a specific credit rating 
rather  we intend to manage our debt levels in a manner consistent with maintaining investment grade quality ratios supported by our strong capability to generate cash from operating activities throughout the business cycle 
having determined that sufficient cash is expected to be generated from operating activities to support at least billion in additional debt  we issued new debt during the third quarter of to support our announced billion accelerated share repurchase 
we believe that we have the financial flexibility needed to support our vision strategy  and maintain investment grade credit quality ratios 
as of december   our company s debt ratio total debt in proportion to total debt plus stockholders equity was  up from as of december  and cash provided by operating activities was approximately of our year end debt cash from operating activities in proportion to total debt 
we expect to maintain our debt ratio at approximately  while growing cash from operating activities 
maintenance of a strong balance sheet well covered by our cash flows remains a key financial policy 
we intend to employ a balanced approach to cash deployment that will enhance stockholder value through reinvesting in core businesses to drive profitable growth through our capital expenditure program  investing in new platforms that address the growing needs in water  energy  hygiene  food  and other areas in the developed and developing worlds  supplementing our organic growth with highly selective acquisitions which bring a growth platform technology or geographic supplement to our core businesses  continuing to pay higher cash dividends to our stockholders dividend payouts have increased at an average compound annual growth rate since  and repurchasing shares to improve overall returns to our stockholders 
in the year ended december   our primary source of cash was from operating activities and the issuance of long term debt 
our principal uses of cash were stock repurchases reduction of debt  capital expenditures  dividends  and acquisitions 
these are summarized in the table below year ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities issuance of long term debt stock repurchases stock option exercise proceeds repayments of long term debt capital expenditures acquisitions dividends our cash flow statement includes the combined results of our continued and discontinued operation for all periods presented 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities of million exceeded the million provided for the year ended december  by million or 
lower net earnings were primarily offset by increases in non cash items  most notably the non cash pension adjustment recorded in the third quarter of lower net working capital needs driven by lower inventories  reduced pension funding and income tax payments were only partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable yielding the year over year increase in operating cash flows 
the reduction in inventories was primarily driven by our salt business as a result of a more typical winter in comparison to unseasonably warm weather in the prior year 
sales in the salt business as well as rapidly developing economies were the primary reason for the increase in accounts receivable which were driven by higher year end sales in versus approximately of cash provided by operating activities was generated during the second half of the year 
this is typical of our seasonality with cash from operating activities concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to working capital patterns in some of our core businesses  such as paint and coatings materials and salt  as well as the timing of certain annual payments such as employee bonuses  interest on debt and property taxes  which have been concentrated in the first half of the year 
we expect cash from operating activities to be in the billion range 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan funding and liability as of december   our us erisa qualified pension plans together with the qualified plans in the uk and canada represented approximately of our global qualified and non qualified pension plan liabilities and approximately of plan assets 
pension plans offered in our western europe and asia locations account for the majority of the balance of plan assets and liabilities 
in  we contributed approximately million to our global qualified and non qualified pension plans as well as our postretirement healthcare plans  down from the million in the prior year period primarily because we were not required to contribute in to our us pension trust 
during  we increased the funding of our us pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans on a tax deductible basis by voluntarily contributing million to our trust 
of this total  million was designated to fund pension benefits and the remaining million to fund retiree health care 
for  total funding for international plans was approximately million  million less than the prior year period  with million of the amount used to fund shortfalls in our uk pension trust 
contributions included a million contribution to fund shortfalls in our canadian pension trust 
we are not required  nor do we expect to make contributions to our us pension trust during we do expect to contribute approximately million to fund both non us qualified pension  non qualified pension and other postretirement plans 
funding requirements for subsequent years are uncertain and will depend on changes in assumptions used to calculate plan funding levels  the actual return on plan assets  changes in the employee groups covered by the plans  and any legislative or regulatory changes affecting plan funding requirements 
see contractual obligations table for our forecasted qualified pension plan contributions  and non qualified pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions  which reflect expected benefit payments 
the company may increase  accelerate  decrease or delay contributions to the plans to the extent permitted by law 
the surplus in the us qualified pension plans improved during as these plans increased their funded status from million as of december  to million as of december  primarily due to a higher discount rate and prior service gains related to plan provision changes approved in while these changes decreased the us plans projected benefit obligation pbo  the reduction was partially offset by the recording of a million increase in the us pbo to recognize the estimated potential impact of a court decision related to cost of living adjustments on our long term pension plan obligations 
see note for more information on the court ruling 
the unfunded status of the non us plans increased from million to million during due to lower returns on plan assets  and additional plan liabilities assumed from the acquisition of a controlling interest in a joint venture in korea 
this increase in plan liabilities of our non us plans was tempered by higher discount rates on the plans projected benefit obligation 
global qualified and non qualified pension expense increased from million in to million in largely due to the million related to the court ruling covering cost of living adjustments cola on our long term pension plan obligations 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in expense within our us plans due to lower amortization of plan losses attributable to actuarial gains achieved in in addition  the growth in asset levels for the us plan during increased the plans expected return on plan assets in the actuarial gains that occurred during will reduce the unrecognized loss being amortized over the average expected future working lifetime of active participants  which varies by plan and ranges from to years 
as a result  global qualified and non qualified pension expense in is expected to decrease approximately million to million with final expense dependent on results of the actuarial valuations of the plans 
capital expenditures we manage our capital expenditures to take advantage of growth and productivity improvement opportunities as well as to fund ongoing environmental protection and plant infrastructure requirements 
we have a well defined review procedure for the authorization of capital projects 
capital expenditures in were higher than prior year expenditures due to several large projects  including projects in rapidly developing economies 
significant capital additions include construction of new paint and coatings plants in mexico  india  and china  environmental regulation compliance projects at manistee and silver springs  technology infrastructure enhancements  and construction of new packaging and building materials plant in turkey 
completion of the new research and development center in shanghai  china  opening of the new cmp research and manufacturing center in taiwan  a project in our louisville  kentucky plant to meet new environmental requirements  expansions in our qingpu  china and weeks island  louisiana plants to increase capacity  and construction of new manufacturing facilities in queratero  mexico and chennai  india 
construction of a new research and development center in shanghai  china which was completed in  capacity initiatives within the north american emulsion manufacturing locations  process control systems at our knoxville  tennessee facility  and volatile organic compound reduction and quality capacity improvements at our chauny  france facility 
expenditures for the past three years  categorized by primary purpose of project  are presented below in millions cost savings and infrastructure capacity additions and new products research facilities and equipment capitalized interest cost total spending for environmental protection equipment included in several of the categories in the table shown above  was million in  million in and million in projected capital expenditures in of approximately million are expected to be well above depreciation expense as we continue to reshape our footprint and make growth investments to drive vision dividends common stock dividends have been paid each year since the payout has increased at an average of compound annual growth rate since dividend paid amount year per common share in millions line graph share repurchase program in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
during  we spent million to purchase million shares to complete this program 
over the term of the authorization  we had repurchased nearly billion of our stock or million shares 
in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to another billion of our common stock  the first billion of which was purchased in september and financed with debt and the remainder of the share repurchases will be funded from available cash through see note for additional information

the debt proceeds were used to finance a billion accelerated share repurchase and the remaining million of the debt proceeds were used to reduce commercial paper outstanding and pay debt issuance costs 
the addition of this new debt was consistent with our vision financial policies as announced during the third quarter of as a result of the issuance  standard and poor s and moody s changed our senior unsecured debt ratings from a minus and a to bbb and baa  respectively  both with stable outlooks 
our short term commercial paper ratings are unchanged at a and p by standard and poor s and moody s  respectively 
we believe these investment grade ratings are consistent with the objectives of our long term financial policies 
in march  we issued million of private placement senior notes due march  we also retired our notes for million upon maturity and early retired at par million of our notes 
interest expense increased in the third and fourth quarters of  consistent with our higher debt levels 
we expect interest expense to run at a quarterly rate of approximately million during at december   we had million in commercial paper outstanding 
other short term debt was primarily composed of local bank borrowings 
during  our primary source of short term liquidity was cash from operating activities  commercial paper  and bank borrowings 
in september  we expanded our syndicated revolving credit facility from million to million  and in december  we extended this facility through december we have no plans to draw on this facility 
use of derivative instruments to manage market risk we use derivative instruments to reduce volatility arising from conducting our business in a variety of currencies  financing at long and short term interest rates and pricing our raw materials at market prices 
we sell products  purchase materials  and finance our operations internationally 
these activities result in assets and liabilities the values of which are exposed to exchange rate fluctuation 
during the year ended december   exchange rate movements increased the carrying value of these balance sheet positions by million after tax 
during the same period the derivative instruments we entered to counter balance these exposures generated losses which  taken together with the effects of exchange rates on underlying balance sheet positions  resulted in an immaterial net earnings impact as intended see note  financial instruments 
all other derivative instruments used million in cash and generated million in after tax gains during the year ended december  as of december   all derivative contracts represented a million after tax liability compared with a million liability at december  contractual obligations the following table provides contractual obligations and commitments for future payments in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years over years operating activities operating leases interest on long term debt raw material purchase obligations  purchase obligations  other  pension and other employee benefit funding fin liabilities deferred revenue financing activities long term debt  including current portion investing activities construction commitments other activities esop loan guarantees interest on esop loan guarantees total contractual cash obligations notes for our requirements contracts  we have assumed that our existing business segments will require materials and services generally consistent with prior years 
the amount of the obligation is based upon either projected requirements or historical spend 
our purchase obligations include raw materials  indirect materials  traffic and logistics  utilities and energy  information technology and communications contracts 
these obligations include evergreen contracts that renew automatically until specifically cancelled by either party 
we have assumed that our evergreen contracts will continue through qualified pension plan contributions depend upon changes in assumptions used to calculate plan funding levels  the actual return on plan assets  changes in employee groups covered by the plans  and any legislative or regulatory changes affecting plan funding requirements  therefore we have only forecasted funding requirements for years due to the fact that significant assumptions are required 
as such  the funding requirements disclosed are subject to change 
the non qualified plan and other employee benefits reflect expected future benefit payments  which are forecasted out through see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to another billion of our common stock  the first billion of which was purchased in september and financed with debt and the remainder of the share repurchases will be funded from available cash through see note for additional information 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin see note income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities 
trading activities we do not have any trading activity that involves non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
unconsolidated entities all significant entities are consolidated 
any unconsolidated entities are de minimis in nature and there are no significant contractual requirements to fund losses of unconsolidated entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our treatment of variable interest entities 
environmental matters and litigation our chemical operations  as those of other chemical manufacturers  involve the use and disposal of substances regulated under environmental protection laws 
our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the risk of harm to the environment 
we have participated in the remediation of waste disposal and manufacturing sites as required under the superfund and related laws 
remediation is well underway or has been completed at many sites 
nevertheless  we continue to face government enforcement actions  as well as private actions  related to past manufacturing and disposal and continue to focus on achieving cost effective remediation where required 
accruals we have provided for costs to remediate former manufacturing and waste disposal sites  including superfund sites  as well as our company facilities 
we consider a broad range of information when we determine the amount necessary for remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for these or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other potentially responsible parties prps to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
reserves for environmental remediation that we believe to be probable and estimable are recorded appropriately as current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
these reserves include liabilities expected to be paid out within the next years 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized at the point during the remedial feasibility study when costs become probable and estimable 
we do not accrue for legal costs expected to be incurred with a loss contingency 
we assess the accruals quarterly and update them as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  we are unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of our responsibility for study and remediation costs 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses  and disclose any material  reasonably possible  additional losses 
if we determine a liability to be only reasonably possible  we consider the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose any material potential liability 
in addition  estimates for liabilities to be incurred between to years in the future are also considered only reasonably possible because the chance of a future event occurring is more than remote but less probable 
these loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment 
we have identified reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million at december  the amounts charged to pre tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included in cost of goods sold and are presented below in millions balance december  amounts charged to earnings amounts spent december  amounts charged to earnings amounts spent december  wood ridge berry s creek the wood ridge  new jersey site site  and berry s creek  which runs past this site  are areas of environmental significance to the company 
the site is the location of a former mercury processing plant acquired many years ago by a company later acquired by morton international  inc morton 
morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation of the site 
the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep issued the record of decision documenting the clean up requirements for the manufacturing site in october the company has submitted a work plan to implement the remediation  and will enter into an agreement or order to perform the work in the first half of the trust created by velsicol will bear a portion of the cost of remediation  consistent with the bankruptcy trust agreement that established the trust 
in addition  the company is in discussions with approximately one dozen non settling parties  including companies whose materials were processed at the manufacturing site  to resolve their share of the liability for a portion of the remediation costs 
our ultimate exposure at the site will depend on clean up costs and on the level of contribution from other parties 
with regard to berry s creek  and the surrounding wetlands  the environmental protection agency epa has issued letters to over prps for performance of a broad scope investigation of risks posed by contamination in berry s creek 
performance of this study is expected to take at least six years to complete once begun 
the prps have formed a representative group of over prps  and are negotiating a scope of work for the study and an administrative order to perform the work through common technical resources and counsel 
it is not yet known how many parties will ultimately sign the administrative order 
today  there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek  but investigation and cleanup costs  as well as potential resource damage assessments  could be very high and our share of these costs could possibly be material to the results of our operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
other environmental expenditures the laws and regulations under which we operate require significant expenditures for capital improvements  operation of environmental protection equipment  environmental compliance and remediation 
our major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make unforeseen additional environmental expenditures 
capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
spending for and is expected to approximate million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental projects intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
the cost of managing  operating and maintaining current pollution abatement facilities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was charged against each year s earnings 
climate change there is an increasing global focus on issues related to climate change and particularly on ways to limit and control the emission of greenhouse gases  which are believed to be associated with climate change 
some initiatives on these topics are already well along in europe  canada and other countries  and related legislation has passed or is being introduced in some us states 
in addition  the supreme court decision in massachusetts v 
epa  holding that greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide co  are air pollutants subject to regulation by epa  has increased the likelihood of federal regulatory or legislative action 
the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change was adopted in in many countries 
for instance  the european union eu has a mandatory emissions trading scheme to implement its objectives under the kyoto protocol 
four of our european locations currently exceed the threshold for participation in the eu emissions trading scheme pursuant to the kyoto protocol and are currently implementing the requirements established by their respective countries 
we are very much aware of the importance of these issues and the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions 
due to the nature of our business  we have emissions of carbon dioxide co primarily from combustion sources  we also have some minor process by product co emissions 
our emissions of other greenhouse gases are infrequent and minimal as compared to co emissions 
we have therefore focused on ways to increase energy efficiency and curb increases in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from growth in production in addition to lowering the energy usage of existing operations 
although the general lack of specific legislation prevents any accurate estimates of the long term impact on the company  any legislation that limits co emissions may create a potential restriction to business growth by capping consumption of traditional energy sources available to all consumers of energy  including rohm and haas 
capping consumption could result in increased energy cost  additional capital investment to lower energy intensity and rationed usage with the need to purchase greenhouse gas emission credits 
our manufacturing council  comprised of facility plant managers  has a global effort underway to improve our energy efficiency at all of our locations through energy audits  sharing best practices and in some cases installation of more efficient equipment 
we will continue to follow these climate change issues  work to improve the energy efficiencies of our operations  work to minimize any negative impacts on company operations and seek technological breakthroughs in energy supply and efficiency in both company operations and product development 
litigation we are involved in various kinds of litigation  principally in the united states 
we strive to resolve litigation where we can through negotiation and other alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation 
otherwise  we vigorously prosecute or defend lawsuits in the courts 
significant litigation is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and divestitures significant acquisitions and divestitures are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
working capital for  working capital decreased by days as compared to due to a reduction in inventory partially offset by an increase in customer receivables 
the reduction in days in inventories was primarily driven by our salt business as a result of a more typical winter in comparison to unseasonably warm weather in the prior year 
sales in salt business as well as rapidly developing economies were the primary reason for the increase in accounts receivable which were driven by higher year end sales in versus details about two major components of working capital at the end of and are summarized below millions inventories year end balance annual turnover x x days cost of sales in ending inventory customer receivables  net year end balance annual turnover x x days sales outstanding notes days sales outstanding were calculated by dividing ending net customer receivables by daily sales for the fourth quarter 
days cost of sales in ending inventory was calculated by dividing ending inventory by daily cost of sales for the fourth quarter 
for customer receivables  annual turnover figures are calculated by dividing annual sales by the average customer receivables balance 
for inventories  annual turnover figures are calculated by dividing cost of goods sold by the average inventory balance 
asset turnover equals sales divided by average year end assets 
asset turnover was x in  x in and x in accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted non controlling interests in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements  which amends arb no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards that require non controlling interests held by non parent parties be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  separate from the parent s equity and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
sfas no 
also requires consistent reporting of any changes to the parent s ownership while retaining a controlling financial interest  as well as specific guidelines over how to treat the deconsolidation of controlling interests and any applicable gains or loses 
this statement will be effective for financial statements issued in we are currently assessing the impact to our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations fas r  which replaces fas fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we will be required to adopt fas r on january  we are currently assessing the impact of fas r on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards in november and in march  the eitf met and issued eitf no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards  in order to clarify the recognition of the income tax benefit received from dividends paid to employees holding equity classified nonvested shares  equity classified nonvested share units  or equity classified nonvested share options charged to retained earnings 
eitf no 
states that the income tax benefit received from dividends paid on equity classified nonvested shares  equity classified nonvested share units  or equity classified nonvested share options should be charged to retained earnings  and should be recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital 
eitf no 
is to be applied prospectively to the income tax benefits on equity classified employee share based payment awards that are declared in fiscal years beginning after september  we do not believe this will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value in an attempt to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  we do not anticipate electing the sfas option for our existing financial assets and liabilities and therefore do not expect the adoption of sfas to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
for financial assets and liabilities  sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until january  we believe the impact will not require material modification of our fair value measurements and will be substantially limited to expanded disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relating to those notes that currently have components measured at fair value 
we will continue to assess the impact on our future financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since we denominate our business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finance our operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchase raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
our operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments for which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting the amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet was a net liability of million pre tax 
all of these contracts were with investment grade financial institutions 
we enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values  as this would not be cost effective 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analyses quantify the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period  most commonly within a one year period 
the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 
foreign exchange rate risk our products are manufactured and sold in a number of locations around the world 
we generate revenues and incur costs in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  we finance operations outside of the united states in local currencies 
our diverse base of local currency costs  financings  and foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts will partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on revenues  earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
nevertheless  when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
our most significant foreign currency exposures are related to our operations in germany  france  italy  the netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden  south africa  canada  japan  australia  korea  taiwan  hong kong  singapore  china  the philippines  thailand and brazil 
known and anticipated exposures are covered by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
we estimate that an instantaneous depreciation in all the currencies of these countries from their levels against the dollar as of december   with all other variables held constant  would increase the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  by million  a appreciation of these currencies would decrease the fair market value by million 
this estimate is based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of short and long term debt by million  net of derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on our earnings per share or cash flows as the majority of our debt obligations at december  consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of the weighted average rate on our worldwide debt 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material and energy prices have had material impacts on our earnings and cash flows in the past  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
commodity derivative instruments are used to reduce portions of commodity price risks 
a increase in the underlying commodity price would increase the fair value of commodity derivative instruments by million 
a decrease in the underlying commodity price would decrease the fair value of commodity derivative instruments by million
