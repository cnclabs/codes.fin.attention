item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the caption risk factors 
general we are principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance  based in nashville  tennessee 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type 
generally  our customers are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
prior to our april  acquisition of usauto holdings  inc  we were engaged in pursuing opportunities to acquire one or more operating companies 
in addition  we marketed for sale a portfolio of foreclosed real estate 
we will continue to market the remaining real estate we hold  consisting of two tracts of land in san antonio  texas  and will attempt to sell it on a basis that provides us with the best economic return 
we do not anticipate any new investments in real estate 
as of september   we leased and operated retail locations or stores  staffed by employee agents 
our employee agents exclusively sell non standard insurance products either underwritten or serviced by us 
as of september   we wrote non standard personal automobile insurance in states and were licensed in additional states 
the following table shows the number of our retail locations for the periods presented 
retail location counts are based upon the date that a location commenced or ceased writing business 
year ended june  retail locations beginning of period opened closed retail locations end of period the following table shows the number of our retail locations by state

table of contents first acceptance corporation k consolidated results of operations overview our primary focus is the selling  servicing and underwriting of non standard personal automobile insurance 
our real estate and corporate segment consists of activities related to the disposition of foreclosed real estate held for sale  interest expense associated with debt  and other general corporate overhead expenses 
the following table presents selected financial data for our insurance operations and real estate and corporate segments for the periods presented 
year ended june  in thousands revenues insurance real estate and corporate consolidated total income loss before income taxes insurance real estate and corporate consolidated total our insurance operations generate revenues from selling  servicing and underwriting non standard personal automobile insurance policies in states 
we conduct our underwriting operations through three insurance company subsidiaries first acceptance insurance company  inc  first acceptance insurance company of georgia  inc 
and first acceptance insurance company of tennessee  inc our insurance revenues are primarily generated from premiums earned  including policy and renewal fees  from sales of policies written and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries  fee income  including installment billing fees on policies written  agency fees and fees for other ancillary services principally motor club and bond card products  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries 
the following table presents premiums earned by state and includes policies written and assumed by the insurance company subsidiaries through quota share reinsurance

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the following table presents the change in the total number of policies in force for the insurance operations for the periods presented 
policies in force increase as a result of new policies issued and decrease as a result of policies that are canceled or expire and are not renewed 
year ended june  policies in force beginning of period net increase decrease during period policies in force end of period insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows 
loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of operating expenses to premiums earned 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by fee income from insureds and  for the period from january  through december   a transaction service fee we received for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago non standard insurance agencies whose business we acquired in january chicago acquisition 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the loss  expense and combined ratios for our insurance operations for the periods presented 
year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense combined the expense ratio for the year ended june  includes expenses of million related to i severance and related benefits charges of million incurred in connection with separation agreements with certain officers and retail management personnel and ii costs of million associated with the closure of poor performing stores 
the effect of these expenses had a negative impact of basis points on the expense ratio for the year ended june  the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
likewise  adverse economic conditions impact our customers and many will choose to go uninsured during a weak economy 
in the past  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity 
if new competitors enter this market  existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
such conditions could lead to reduced prices  which would negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
we believe that between and  the underwriting results in the non standard personal automobile insurance industry improved as a result of favorable pricing and competitive conditions that allowed for broad increases in rate levels by insurers 
while we did witness a stabilization in the industry during and a robust economy through  more recently  competitive pricing and the weakening economy have resulted in declines in premiums in most states 
given the cyclical nature of the industry and the economy  these conditions may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k investments we use the services of an independent investment manager to manage our fixed investment portfolio 
the investment manager conducts  in accordance with the company s investment policy  all of the investment purchases and sales for our insurance company subsidiaries 
our investment policy has been established by the investment committee of our board of directors and specifically addresses overall investment goals and objectives  authorized investments  prohibited securities  and guidelines as to asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
the portfolio is compared with a customized lehman brothers index 
we do not invest in equity securities 
management and the investment committee meet regularly to review the performance of the portfolio and compliance with the company s investment guidelines  including the approval of all purchase and sale transactions 
the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries consist substantially of marketable  investment grade  us government securities  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations 
we also invest a portion of the portfolio in certain securities issued by political subdivisions which enable our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is comprised primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses  which are included in other revenues in our consolidated statements of operations  may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings to obtain premium tax credits or based upon changes in interest rates 
our consolidated investment portfolio was million at june  and consisted of fixed maturity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity on an after tax basis 
we had net unrealized losses of million on fixed maturity securities at june  at june   of our investment portfolio was rated investment grade a credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies 
the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was aa at june  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
management believes that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos were million at june  and represented of our fixed maturity portfolio 
cmos are subject to significant extension risk in periods of rising interest rates as mortgages may be repaid slower than expected 
as of june   all of our cmos were considered investment grade 
in addition  of the cmos were rated aaa and of our cmos were backed by agencies of the united states government 
of the non agency cmos  were rated aaa

net loss for the year ended june  was million  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended june  basic and diluted net loss per share was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  insurance operations revenues from insurance operations were million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  income before income taxes from insurance operations for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the year ended june  premiums earned premiums earned decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this decline was due to the decrease in the number of policies written  which was partially offset by higher average premiums per policy as a result of rate increases taken in a number of states to improve underwriting profitability 
the decrease in the policies written was due to the current weak economic conditions impacting our customers  rate increases taken in a number of states to improve underwriting profitability and the closure of poor performing stores since january premiums earned in florida  georgia and tennessee for the year ended june  declined by million over the prior year 
these markets collectively accounted for of premiums earned during fiscal  down from in the prior year 
our premiums earned in these states were adversely affected by a decline in used car sales  which have historically been a significant contributor to new policy growth in these markets 
additionally  the decline in our florida market was due to a january  rate increase to improve our underwriting profitability and the decline in our georgia market was due to state legislation intended to curb illegal immigration 
the decline in premiums earned was partially offset by premium growth of million in our emerging markets of south carolina and pennsylvania 
the total number of insured policies in force at june  decreased over the same date in from  to  at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  
table of contents first acceptance corporation k commission and fee income commission and fee income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease was a result of the decrease in policies in force noted above partially offset by higher fee income in illinois and florida 
investment income investment income increased during the year ended june  as invested assets increased as a result of cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds received from the sale of debentures in june the tax equivalent book yields for our fixed maturities portfolio were and at june  and  respectively  with effective durations of years and years at june  and  respectively 
the yields for the comparable lehman brothers indices were and at june  and  respectively 
other included in other revenues during the year ended june  are million of charges related to the other than temporary impairment of certain non agency cmos in our investment portfolio 
due to the deterioration in liquidity in the credit markets during calendar  yields on certain non agency cmos declined below projected book yields requiring the million impairment of these securities under the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets eitf 
other revenues for the year ended june  are primarily comprised of million in transaction service fees earned for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago non standard insurance agencies whose assets we acquired in january we received the transaction service fee from the effective date of the acquisition in january through december  loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the same period last year 
during fiscal  we experienced a higher than anticipated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio primarily as a result of significant unanticipated increases in i the frequency of personal injury protection pip coverage losses in florida  ii the severity of bodily injury losses in florida and georgia  and iii the severity of property damage losses in georgia and other states 
this higher than anticipated severity in georgia bodily injury losses in fiscal was driven by a higher than anticipated occurrence of large losses losses of  or above 
additionally  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for fiscal improved due to rate increases in florida taken in connection with the reinstatement of florida s motor vehicle no fault law pip coverage 
this law and the related coverage expired september  but was reinstated effective january  our loss ratio exclusive of loss adjustment expenses for florida s pip coverage improved to for the year ended june  from for the prior fiscal year 
premiums earned on florida s pip coverage decreased to million from million over the same period 
for the year ended june   we experienced favorable development for prior accident periods of approximately million 
for the year ended june   we experienced negative development for losses occurring in prior accident periods of approximately million 
we believe this development for the year ended june  was due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and was not the result of any individual factor 
the estimation process for the year ended june  was impacted by our limited historical loss experience in our newer states which required more judgment in determining our loss reserve estimates for those states 
excluding development for prior accident periods  for those premiums earned during the years ended june  and  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios were and  respectively 
we believe that this improvement was the result of i the absence of the negative factors experienced during fiscal  ii the impact of rate increases taken during fiscal in florida january  indiana february  texas march and south carolina may and iii improvements in our underwriting and claim handling practices 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily a result of i severance and related benefits charges of million incurred in connection with separation agreements with certain officers and retail management personnel  ii expenses of million associated with the closure of poor performing stores and iii costs relating to the increased investment in our product  actuarial and information technology functions to support our rate making capabilities 
the increased costs were partially offset by cost savings related to the decline in the number of active retail locations 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the year over year decline in premiums earned and the net effect of the expenses discussed above which had a negative impact of basis points on the expense ratio during the year ended june  and the positive impact on the expense ratio during the year ended june  from the transaction service fee of million  or basis points  earned through december  in connection with the chicago acquisition 
overall  the combined ratio decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  litigation settlement litigation settlement costs for the year ended june  of million relate to the provision of million associated with estimated payments of the fees and costs of plaintiffs counsel  million in estimated costs associated with the administration of the settlement as well as million incurred in connection with our defense of the litigation in alabama and georgia 
we have entered into a settlement agreement relating to the georgia litigation  which is subject to approval by the court  and have agreed upon preliminary settlement terms with the plaintiffs in the alabama actions 
the settlement of the alabama litigation is subject to negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement and approval by the applicable courts 
pursuant to the litigation settlements  we would i provide the plaintiffs with either a premium credit towards a future insurance policy or a reimbursement certificate for certain future towing and rental expenses  ii strengthen our disclosures to customers of all relevant fees  charges and coverages  iii pay an aggregate of million in fees and expenses for the attorneys for the plaintiffs and iv pay the costs associated with the administration of the settlements 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the total costs associated with the georgia and alabama litigation settlements 
the costs of the settlements will depend  among other factors  upon whether class members receive premium credits or reimbursement certificates pursuant to the terms of the settlements and the rate of redemption of the premium credits and reimbursement certificates 
the litigation settlement costs are set forth separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
we anticipate that our payment of the million in plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses and the million in estimated costs associated with the administration of the settlement  both of which were accrued at june   will occur in calendar year  after the final approvals from the courts 
we are currently in discussions with our insurance carriers regarding coverage for the costs and expenses incurred relating to the litigation settlements and are not able currently to estimate the amount  if any  that we may receive from our insurance carriers 
as a result  we have not accrued any amount at june  for insurance recoveries that may offset the costs and expenses relating to the litigation settlements 
any such insurance recoveries will be recorded in our operating results during the periods in which the recoveries are probable

the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  includes an increase in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million as well as million related to the expiration of certain net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a deferred tax asset charge totaling million 
the changes during the years ended june  and related to the valuation allowance were due to revisions in estimates for our future taxable income based on the most recent fiscal year results 
the charges during the years ended june  and related to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards were due to taxable income for the most recent fiscal year being less than our prior estimates

approximately of the premium growth was in florida  texas and south carolina  where we opened locations in fiscal  and chicago  where we acquired locations in january the total number of insured policies in force at june  increased over the same date in from  to  at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  commission and fee income commission and fee income increased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this increase was the result of the growth in net premiums earned 
however  fee income increased at a rate lower than our increase in premiums earned because we charge lower fees in florida compared with our other states

the higher than anticipated severity in georgia bodily injury losses in fiscal was somewhat driven by a higher than anticipated occurrence of large losses losses of  or above 
to a lesser extent  the increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for fiscal was the result of a change in our business mix resulting from premium growth in our emerging states of florida and texas where we anticipated higher loss ratios 
our loss ratio exclusive of loss adjustment expenses for florida s pip coverage was for the year ended june  on premiums earned of million 
in january  we hired a new head of product management with significant experience in rate making for the non standard automobile insurance sector 
in addition  we filed new rates in florida december  south carolina and georgia march and pennsylvania september 
operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the fiscal addition of new stores including those acquired in chicago and expenses  such as advertising  employee agent compensation  rent and premium taxes that vary along with the increase in premiums earned 
the expense ratio decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily a result of the increase in premiums earned from new stores without a corresponding increase in fixed operating costs such as advertising  rent and base compensation of our employee agents 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  as a result of the higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio

our primary uses of funds are the payment of claims and operating expenses

we also made an additional principal prepayment of million on our term loan facility in august and we are required to repay the remaining million principal balance of our term loan facility by october  during the year ended june   the insurance company subsidiaries paid ordinary dividends to the holding company of million in october and million in december these dividends were used to repay the million in unscheduled debt payments noted above as well as for general corporate activities 
at june   we had million available in unrestricted cash and investments outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
these funds and the additional unrestricted cash from the sources described in the next paragraph were used to pay the principal prepayment of million noted above and will be used to pay the final payment on our term loan facility of million on october  and the amounts to be paid by the company related to the litigation settlements 
for additional information with respect to the litigation settlements  see item legal proceedings 
we are part of an insurance holding company system with substantially all of our operations conducted by our insurance company subsidiaries 
accordingly  the holding company s primary sources of cash are dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and from our non insurance company subsidiaries that sell ancillary products to our insureds 
the holding company will also receive cash from operating activities as a result of investment income and the ultimate liquidation of our foreclosed real estate held for sale 
in addition  as a result of our nol carryforwards  taxable income generated by the insurance company subsidiaries through june  will provide cash to the holding company through an intercompany tax allocation agreement through which the insurance company subsidiaries reimburse the holding company for current tax benefits utilized through recognition of the nol carryforwards 
cash could also be made available through the issuance of securities and loans from financial institutions 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from our insurance company subsidiaries 
these limitations relate to statutory capital and surplus and net income 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
a low rbc ratio would prevent an insurance company from paying dividends 
statutory guidelines suggest that the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to we believe that our insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient financial resources available to support their net premium writings in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
based on our december  statutory capital and surplus  our ordinary dividend capacity for calendar is approximately million 
such amount is limited however to the amount of earned surplus of faic 
at june   our ordinary dividend capacity was approximately million 
however  available ordinary dividends from faic s wholly owned insurance company subsidiaries can increase the earned surplus of faic to million 
the timing of ordinary dividend payments during calendar is affected by the amount of dividend payments made in the preceding twelve month period 
therefore  subject to the sufficiency of earned surplus  faic is permitted to pay an ordinary dividend of million in october and an additional million in december should the above mentioned cash flows not be sufficient to meet the funding requirements outside of the insurance company subsidiaries  faic has the ability to request approval from the texas department of insurance to pay an extraordinary dividend 
approval of such extraordinary dividend would be based upon the reasonableness of faic s remaining surplus after payment of the dividend in relation to its outstanding liabilities and the adequacy of surplus relative to faic s financial needs 
for the twelve months ended june   faic s ratio of net premiums written to policyholders surplus was  which was within the iris defined limit of 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows as noted above  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
our growth strategy may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing 
we cannot assure you that additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  or that any such financing would not negatively impact our results of operations 
credit facility in connection with the chicago acquisition  we entered into  and borrowed under  a credit agreement with two banks consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility  both maturing on june  through september   both facilities bore interest at libor plus basis points per annum 
subsequently  amended terms increased the interest rate by basis points 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on january  that fixed the interest rate on the term loan facility at through june  at june   the swap had a negative fair value of million and is included within other assets 
payments receipts associated with the swap are reported in the statement of operations as a part of interest expense 
the term loan facility was originally due in equal quarterly installments through june  both facilities are secured by the common stock and certain assets of our non regulated subsidiaries 
for the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with the noted credit agreement 
at june   the unpaid balance due under the facilities was million 
at june   we were not in compliance with our financial covenants in the credit agreement regarding a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth ratio and a minimum net income requirement 
our lenders waived this non compliance as of june  and we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement dated september  the amended terms i required us to make a prepayment of million in principal on august   ii accelerated the maturity date of the term loan facility to october   iii eliminated the revolving credit facility and iv removed all financial covenants for the remaining term

table of contents first acceptance corporation k critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting policies 
valuation of deferred tax asset we maintain income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting policy because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 
after considering the recent declines in premiums written  premiums earned and policies in force  we assessed the realization of our net operating loss nol carryforwards  which comprises the majority of our deferred tax asset 
we concluded that it was appropriate to increase our valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to the nol carryforwards 
further  during the year ended june   the provision for income taxes included charges related to the expiration of certain nol carryforwards due to taxable income for the current fiscal year being less than our prior estimates 
as in our prior assessments  we considered our historical and expected taxable income to determine the sufficiency of our valuation allowance 
we remain optimistic about the company s future outlook and expect to generate taxable income sufficient to realize our remaining net deferred tax asset 
however  our evaluation includes multiple assumptions and estimates that may change over time 
if future taxable income is less than current projections  an additional valuation allowance may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the valuation of our deferred tax asset 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are attributable to our insurance operations and are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes 
we perform an annual impairment test 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired  an interim impairment test would be required 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are periodically reviewed to ensure that no conditions exist indicating the recorded amount is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
as a part of our annual impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of such assets  recent trends in our results  including premiums written  premiums earned and policies in force as well as the estimated future discounted cash flows associated with these assets  were compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to market value or discounted cash flow value was necessary 
based on this evaluation  we concluded that goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were fully realizable as of june  however  our evaluation includes multiple assumptions  including estimated discounted cash flows and estimates that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by the company  an impairment charge may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
investments our investments are recorded at fair value  which is typically based on publicly available quoted prices 
from time to time  the carrying value of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of the inherent volatility of publicly traded investments 
management reviews investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary would result in a charge against income 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our fixed maturities portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in sec filings for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for collateralized mortgage obligations 
securities with declines attributable to market or sector declines where we have the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value are not deemed to be other than temporary 
if we determine that the value of an investment is other than temporarily impaired  the impairment would be charged against income  a new cost basis for the security would be established and the amount of the impairment would be amortized through income over the remaining life of the security 
our evaluations during the year ended june  resulted in other than temporary impairment charges totaling million related to certain non agency cmos in our investment portfolio 
due to the deterioration in liquidity in the credit markets during calendar  yields on certain non agency cmos declined below projected book yields requiring the impairment under the guidance set forth in eitf other than the decline in the yields of these securities resulting from changes in prepayment assumptions  the underlying assets of these securities continue to perform within expectations 
at june   the investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of million 
since it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become other than temporarily impaired  total impairment charges could be material to the consolidated results of operations in a future period 
however  management believes that it is not likely that such impairment charges will have a significant effect on our liquidity 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not been paid 
months and potentially years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported  which are referred to herein as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including case and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate unpaid liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our internal actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
we utilize our internal actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates  generally  the fair value of fixed income investments moves inversely with movements in market interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
this portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of our insurance company subsidiaries are managed to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
interest rate risk the fair values of our fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair values of those instruments 
additionally  the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates resulting from parallel shifts in market yield curves on our fixed maturity portfolio in thousands 
it is assumed that the effects are realized immediately upon the change in interest rates 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table 
sensitivity to instantaneous interest rate changes basis points fair value of fixed maturity portfolio the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments at june  which are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows expected principal cash flows at par value  which differs from amortized cost as a result of discounts at the time of purchase and other than temporary impairment by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and collectively for all years thereafter in thousands 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
cmos and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns
