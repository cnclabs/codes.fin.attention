item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec may contain forward looking statements 
in addition  our senior management and other authorized spokespersons may make forward looking statements in print or orally to analysts  investors  the media and others 
forward looking statements concern  among others  plans  objectives  proposed capital expenditures and future events or performance 
these statements reflect our current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ include regulatory issues  including those that affect allowed rates of return  terms and conditions of service  rate structures and financings 
we are impacted by regulation of the north carolina utilities commission ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina pscsc and the tennessee regulatory authority tra 
in addition  we purchase natural gas transportation and storage services from interstate and intrastate pipeline companies whose rates and services are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the ncuc  respectively 
residential  commercial and industrial growth in our service areas 
the ability to grow our customer base and the pace of that growth are impacted by general business and economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  fluctuations in the capital markets and the overall strength of the economy in our service areas and the country 
deregulation  unanticipated impacts of regulatory restructuring and competition in the energy industry 
we face competition from electric companies and energy marketing and trading companies 
as a result of deregulation  we expect this highly competitive environment to continue 
the potential loss of large volume industrial customers due to alternate fuels or to bypass or the shift by such customers to special competitive contracts at lower per unit margins 
regulatory issues  customer growth  deregulation  economic and capital market conditions  the cost and availability of natural gas and weather conditions can impact our ability to meet internal performance goals 
the capital intensive nature of our business 
in order to maintain our historic growth  we must construct additions to our natural gas distribution system each year 
the cost of this construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining government approvals  development project delays or changes in project costs 
weather  general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost of a project 
our cash flows are not adequate to finance the cost of this construction 
as a result  we must fund a portion of our cash needs through borrowings and the issuance of common stock 
changes in the availability and cost of natural gas 
to meet firm customer requirements  we must acquire sufficient gas supplies and pipeline capacity to ensure delivery to our distribution system while also ensuring that our supply and capacity contracts will allow us to remain competitive 
natural gas is an unregulated commodity subject to market supply and demand and price volatility 
we have a diversified portfolio of local peaking facilities  transportation and storage contracts with interstate pipelines and supply contracts with major producers and marketers to satisfy the supply and delivery requirements of our customers 
because these producers  marketers and pipelines are subject to operating and financial risks associated with exploring  drilling  producing  gathering  marketing and transporting natural gas  their risks also increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
we engage in hedging activities to reduce price volatility for our customers 
changes in weather conditions 
weather conditions and other natural phenomena can have a large impact on our earnings 
severe weather conditions can impact our suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to our distribution system 
extended mild or severe weather  either during the winter period or the summer period  can have a significant impact on the demand for and the cost of natural gas 
changes in environmental regulations and cost of compliance 
earnings from our equity investments 
we have investments in unregulated retail natural gas and propane marketing  interstate natural gas storage and intrastate natural gas transportation 
these companies have risks that are inherent to their industries and  as an equity investor  we assume such risks 
all of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that these statements will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
when used in our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  seek  intend  plan  estimate  expect  objective  projection  budget  forecast  goal or similar words or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could or may are intended to identify forward looking statements

our business piedmont natural gas company  inc  which began operations in  is an energy services company primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas to  residential  commercial and industrial customers in north carolina  south carolina and tennessee  including  customers served by municipalities who are our wholesale customers 
our subsidiaries are invested in joint venture  energy related businesses  including unregulated retail natural gas and propane marketing  interstate natural gas storage  intrastate natural gas transportation and regulated natural gas distribution 
we also sell residential and commercial gas appliances in tennessee 
in  our predecessor  which was incorporated in under the same name  was merged into a newly formed north carolina corporation for the purpose of changing our state of incorporation to north carolina 
effective january   we purchased for cash the natural gas distribution assets of atmos energy corporation located in the city of gaffney and portions of cherokee county  south carolina 
the acquisition was at book value of million and added  customers to our operations 
effective september   we purchased for million in cash substantially all of the natural gas distribution assets and certain of the liabilities of north carolina gas service ncgs  a division of nui utilities  inc the initial purchase price was reduced by million in due to adjusting estimated working capital to actual 
final determination of the purchase price allocation resulted in recording goodwill of million 
the transaction added  customers to our distribution system in the counties of rockingham and stokes  north carolina 
effective at the close of business on september   we purchased for million in cash of the common stock of ncng from progress 
ncng  a natural gas distributor  served approximately  customers in eastern north carolina  including  customers served by four municipalities who were wholesale customers of ncng 
the purchase price for the ncng common stock was increased by the amount of ncng s working capital on the closing date 
based on a preliminary working capital schedule  the closing date working capital was million 
the preliminary working capital amount will be adjusted to actual under the terms of the purchase agreement in ncng was merged into piedmont immediately following the closing 
we also purchased for million in cash progress equity interest in easternnc 
easternnc is a regulated utility that has a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide natural gas service to counties in eastern north carolina that previously were not served with natural gas 
progress equity interest in easternnc consisted of of easternnc s outstanding common stock and of easternnc s outstanding preferred stock 
we are obligated to purchase additional authorized but unissued shares of such preferred stock for million 
the primary reasons for these acquisitions are consistent with our strategy of pursuing profitable growth in our core natural gas distribution business in the southeast 
the reasons for the acquisitions and the factors that contributed to the goodwill include a reasonable purchase price slightly above book value  the prospect of entering a market contiguous to our existing north carolina service areas where  as a combined company  we could realize on going system benefits  the prospect of acquiring an operation that could be integrated into our existing business systems and processes  and the opportunity to grow within a regulatory environment with which we are familiar 
we have two reportable business segments  regulated utility and non utility activities 
for further information on segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our utility operations are subject to regulation by the ncuc  the pscsc and the tra as to rates  service area  adequacy of service  safety standards  extensions and abandonment of facilities  accounting and depreciation 
we are also subject to regulation by the ncuc as to the issuance of securities 
we are also subject to or affected by various federal regulations 
these federal regulations include regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry  such as regulations of the ferc that affect the availability of and the prices paid for the interstate transportation of natural gas  regulations of the department of transportation that affect the construction  operation and maintenance of natural gas distribution systems and regulations of the environmental protection agency relating to the use and release into the environment of hazardous wastes 
in addition  we are subject to numerous regulations  such as those relating to employment practices  that are generally applicable to companies doing business in the united states 
we continually assess the nature of our business and explore alternatives to traditional utility regulation 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services provide additional challenges and opportunities for us 
for further information  see results of operations below and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in the carolinas  our service area is comprised of numerous cities  towns and communities including anderson  greenville and spartanburg in south carolina and charlotte  salisbury  greensboro  winston salem  high point  burlington  hickory  spruce pine  reidsville  fayetteville  new bern  wilmington  tarboro  elizabeth city  rockingham and goldsboro in north carolina 
in north carolina  we also provide wholesale natural gas service to greenville  monroe  rocky mount and wilson 
in tennessee  our service area is the metropolitan area of nashville  including wholesale natural gas service to gallatin and smyrna 
financial condition and liquidity we finance current cash requirements primarily from operating cash flows and short term borrowings 
during  outstanding short term borrowings under committed bank lines of credit totaling million ranged from zero to million  and interest rates ranged from to 
as of october   we had additional uncommitted lines of credit totaling million on a no fee and as needed  if available  basis 
as of october   our current assets of million were less than our current liabilities of million primarily due to the short term financing of the acquisitions of ncng and an equity interest in easternnc with commercial paper of million 
on december   we redeemed million of the commercial paper with the net proceeds from the sale of million of medium term notes 
see subsequent events update in note to our consolidated financial statements in item our utility operations are weather sensitive 
the primary factor that impacts our cash flows from operations is weather 
warmer weather can lead to lower total margin from fewer volumes of natural gas sold or transported 
colder weather can increase volumes sold to weather sensitive customers  but extremely cold weather may lead to conservation by customers in order to reduce their consumption 
weather outside the normal range of temperatures can lead to reduced operating cash flows  thereby increasing the need for short term borrowings to meet current cash requirements 
during  of our sales and transportation revenues were from residential customers and were from commercial customers  both of which are weather sensitive 
our regulatory commissions approve rates that are designed to produce revenues to cover our gas costs and our fixed and variable non gas costs assuming normal weather 
in addition  we have weather normalization adjustment mechanisms wna in all three states that partially offset the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on bills rendered in november through march for weather sensitive customers 
weather in was colder than normal  compared with warmer than normal in and colder than normal in the wna generated credits to customers of million in  charges to customers of million in and credits to customers of million in in north carolina and tennessee  adjustments are made directly to the customer s bill 
in south carolina  the adjustments are calculated at the individual customer level and recorded in a deferred account for subsequent collection or disbursement to all customers in the class 
the wna formula calculates the actual weather variance from normal  using years of history  which results in an increase in revenues when weather is warmer than normal and a decrease in revenues when weather is colder than normal 
the gas cost portion of our costs is recoverable through purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms and is not affected by the wna 
the regulated utility faces competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products and the relative prices of those products 
the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity for space heating  water heating and cooking 
increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the end user 
this could negatively impact our liquidity if customer growth slows or if customers conserve 
in the industrial market  many of our customers have the capability of burning a fuel other than natural gas  fuel oil being the most significant competing energy alternative 
our ability to maintain industrial market share is largely dependent on price 
the relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of natural gas 
with the growing imbalance between domestic supply and demand  the cost of natural gas from non domestic sources may play a greater role in establishing the market price of natural gas in the future 
the price of oil depends upon a number of factors beyond our control  including the relationship between supply and demand and policies of foreign and domestic governments 
our liquidity could be impacted either positively or negatively as a result of alternate fuel decisions by industrial customers 
the level of short term borrowings can vary significantly due to changes in the wholesale prices of natural gas and to increased purchases of natural gas supplies to serve additional customer demand during cold weather and to refill storage 
short term debt may increase when wholesale prices for natural gas increase because we must pay suppliers for the gas before we recover our costs from customers through their monthly bills 
gas prices could fluctuate for the next several years due to the growing imbalance between domestic supply and demand 
if wholesale gas prices remain high  we may incur more short term debt to pay for natural gas supplies and other operating costs since collections from customers could be slower and some customers may not be able to pay their bills 
we sell common stock and long term debt to cover cash requirements when market and other conditions favor such long term financing 
during  we issued million of common stock through dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans but none on the open market 
we did not sell any long term debt during fiscal  however  we did retire million of medium term notes at the scheduled maturity date and made a sinking fund payment of million on the senior notes 
as noted above  in december we sold million of long term debt and redeemed commercial paper issued in connection with funding the acquisitions of ncng and an equity interest in easternnc 
as of october   our capitalization consisted of in long term debt and in common equity 
our long term targeted capitalization ratio is in long term debt and in common equity 
as of october   all of our long term debt was unsecured 
our long term debt is rated a by standard poor s ratings services with a negative outlook and a by moody s investors service with a negative outlook 
credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short term and long term financing and the cost of such financings 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider various factors 
the more significant quantitative factors include ratio of total debt to total capitalization  including balance sheet leverage  ratio of net cash flows to capital expenditures  funds from operations interest coverage  ratio of funds from operations to average total debt and pre tax interest coverage 
qualitative factors include  among other things stability of regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate  risks and controls inherent in the distribution of natural gas  predictability of cash flows  business strategy and management  corporate governance guidelines and practices  industry position and contingencies 
we are subject to default provisions related to our long term debt  short term bank lines of credit and accounts receivable financing 
the default provisions of our senior notes are failure to make principal  interest or sinking fund payments  interest coverage of times  total debt cannot exceed of total capitalization  funded debt of all subsidiaries in the aggregate cannot exceed of total company capitalization  failure to make payments on any capitalized lease obligation  bankruptcy  liquidation or insolvency and final judgment against us in excess of million that after days is not discharged  satisfied or stayed pending appeal 
the default provisions of our medium term notes are failure to make principal  interest or sinking fund payments  failure after the receipt of a day notice to observe or perform for any covenant or agreement in the notes or in the indenture under which the notes were issued and bankruptcy  liquidation or insolvency 
failure to satisfy any of the default provisions results in total outstanding issues becoming due 
there are cross default provisions in all our debt agreements 
based on our calculations  we met the default provisions as of october  the financial condition of the natural gas marketers and pipelines that supply and deliver natural gas to our distribution system can increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
we believe our risk exposure to the financial condition of the marketers and pipelines is minimal based on our receipt of the products and other services prior to payment and the availability of other marketers of natural gas to meet our supply needs if necessary 
the natural gas business is seasonal in nature  resulting in fluctuations primarily in balances in accounts receivable from customers  inventories of stored natural gas and accounts payable to suppliers  in addition to fluctuations in short term borrowings noted above 
most of our annual earnings are realized in the winter period  which is the first five months of our fiscal year 
as is prevalent in the industry  we inject natural gas into storage during the summer months principally april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months principally november through march when customer demand is higher 
inventories of gas in storage increased from october  to october   and accounts payable and accounts receivable increased during this same period due to seasonality  higher gas prices  the growth of our business and the demand for gas during the winter season 
we have a substantial capital expansion program for construction of distribution facilities  purchase of equipment and other general improvements funded through sources noted above 
utility construction expenditures in were million  compared with million in utility construction expenditures totaling million  primarily to serve customer growth  are budgeted for due to projected growth in our service areas  significant utility construction expenditures are expected to continue 
short term debt may be used to finance construction pending the issuance of long term debt or equity 
as of october   our estimated future contractual obligations for long term debt  purchase obligations and capital and operating leases were as follows payments due by period less than after in thousands year years years years total long term debt purchase obligations capital leases operating leases purchase obligations consist of pipeline and storage capacity and gas supply contracts that are recoverable through purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other relevant factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions and make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current information if we determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are warranted 
our regulated utility segment is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
our accounting policies conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation statement  and are in accordance with accounting requirements and ratemaking practices prescribed by the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows us to defer expenses and income in the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
we then recognize these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
if we  for any reason  cease to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of our operations  we would eliminate from the balance sheet the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria and include them in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such an event could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period this action was recorded 
we believe the following represents the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
unbilled utility revenues 
we record estimated revenues for volumes delivered but not yet billed at month end due to reading meters and billing on a cycle basis 
the estimated revenues are calculated based on estimated volumes delivered but unbilled at month end and the billing rates applicable to those volumes  adjusted for any estimated billing impacts of the wna in the appropriate months 
for further information on operating revenues  see note h to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our billed accounts receivable based on recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
employee benefits 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of eligible full time employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  group medical benefits and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
our recorded liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liabilities are based on analyses of historical data and actuarial estimates and are not discounted 
along with independent actuaries  we review the liabilities at least annually to ensure that they are appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates 
long term incentive plan 
we have a long term incentive plan ltip under which units  equivalent in value to one share of common stock  are awarded to participants 
through october   the performance period was a five year period  however  effective november   the performance period is a three year period 
following the end of the performance period and if performance measures are met  awards are distributed in the form of shares of common stock and cash withheld to pay taxes 
during the performance period  we calculate the expense and liability for the ltip based on performance levels achieved or expected to be achieved and the estimated market value of common stock as of the distribution date 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  actual amounts  which are not known until after the end of the performance period  could differ from our estimates 
gas supply and regulatory proceedings to meet customer requirements  we acquire gas supplies and pipeline capacity to ensure delivery to meet the demands of our distribution system  while also ensuring that supply and capacity contracts allow us to remain competitive 
we have a diversified portfolio of local peaking facilities  transportation and storage contracts with interstate pipelines and supply contracts with major producers and marketers to satisfy the supply and delivery requirements of our customers 
the gas delivered to meet our design day requirements for firm customers is purchased under firm contractual commitments 
these contracts provide that we pay a reservation fee to the supplier to reserve or guarantee the availability of gas supplies for delivery 
under these provisions  absent force majeure conditions  any disruption of supply deliverability is subject to penalty and damage assessment 
we ensure the delivery of the gas supplies to our distribution system to meet the peak day  seasonal and annual needs of our customers by using a variety of firm transportation and storage capacity arrangements 
the pipeline capacity contracts require the payment of fixed demand charges to reserve firm transportation or storage entitlements 
we align the contractual agreements for supply with the firm capacity agreements in terms of volumes  receipt and delivery locations and demand fluctuations 
we may supplement firm contractual commitments with other supply arrangements to serve our interruptible market  or as an alternate supply for inventory withdrawals or injections 
the source of the gas we distribute is primarily the on shore and off shore gulf coast production region and is purchased primarily from major producers and marketers 
in our opinion  present rules and regulations of our three state regulatory commissions permit the pass through of interstate pipeline capacity and storage service costs that may be incurred under orders or regulations of the ferc  as well as commodity gas costs from natural gas suppliers 
the majority of our natural gas supply is purchased from producers and marketers in non regulated transactions 
our rate schedules include provisions permitting the recovery of prudently incurred gas costs 
the ncuc and the pscsc require annual prudence reviews covering historical twelve month periods 
for the most recent periods  the ncuc and the pscsc found us to be prudent in our gas purchasing practices and allowed recovery of of our gas costs 
in  the tra approved a performance incentive plan that eliminated annual prudence reviews in tennessee and established an incentive sharing mechanism based on differences in the actual cost of gas purchased and benchmark amounts determined by published market indices 
these differences  after applying a monthly positive or negative deadband  together with margin from marketing unused capacity in the secondary market and margin from secondary market sales of gas  are subject to an overall annual cap of million for shareholder gains or losses 
the net gains or losses on gas costs within the deadband to of the benchmark are not subject to sharing under the plan and are allocated to customers 
any net gains or losses on gas costs outside the deadband are combined with capacity management benefits and shared between customers and shareholders  subject to the annual cap 
the net overall annual performance results are collected from or refunded to customers  subject to the cap 
in addition to the elimination of annual gas purchase prudence reviews  the benefits of the incentive plan include the reduction of gas costs for customers and potential earnings to shareholders by sharing in gas cost reductions 
initially approved for a two year period  the plan now continues on a year to year basis each july until we notify the tra of termination days before the end of a plan year or until the plan is modified  amended or terminated by the tra 
in  the ncuc ordered us to establish an expansion fund to enable the extension of natural gas service into unserved areas of the state 
the expansion fund was funded with supplier refunds  plus investment income earned  that would otherwise be refunded to customers 
in accordance with an ncuc order in  we no longer deposit such refunds in the expansion fund 
as of october   the balance of million in our expansion fund held by the state is included in restricted cash with an offsetting liability included in refunds due customers in the consolidated balance sheets 
in  the north carolina general assembly enacted the clean water and natural gas critical needs act of which provided for the issuance of million of general obligation bonds of the state for the purpose of providing grants  loans or other financing for the cost of constructing natural gas facilities in unserved areas of the state 
easternnc was granted million of the million state bond package to pay for the uneconomic portion of the infrastructure to construct a pipeline and distribution system of approximately miles 
the economic portion of the project was estimated to cost million 
as of october   easternnc had received million from bond funds and had recorded a bond reimbursement receivable of million 
in  the pscsc approved a gas cost hedging plan for the purpose of cost stabilization for customers 
this plan is limited to of our annual normalized sales volumes for south carolina and operates off of historical pricing indices that are tied to future projected gas prices as traded on a national exchange 
all properly accounted for costs incurred in accordance with the plan  except for certain personnel and administrative costs that are recovered in rates as operations and maintenance expenses  are deemed to be prudently incurred and are recovered in rates as a gas cost 
we began hedging activities in april under the approved program 
effective november   we implemented a hedging program in north carolina under the terms of a generic order issued by the ncuc on february   as later clarified by a piedmont specific order dated october this plan is limited to of the annual normalized sales volumes for north carolina and operates off of pricing indices that are tied to future projected gas prices as traded on a national exchange 
we believe the plan is designed with limited subjective discretion in making purchases with little or no risk of speculation in the market 
prudently incurred gas costs associated with the hedging program are not pre approved by the ncuc but are treated as gas costs subject to the annual gas cost prudency review based on information available at the time of the hedge  not at the time of the prudency review 
through october   we have recovered of gas costs subject to prudency review 
on october   the ncuc issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of million  effective november  this order also approved changes in cost allocations and rate design and changes in tariffs and service regulations 
on october   the pscsc issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of million  effective november  this order also approved new depreciation rates and changes in cost allocations and rate design and changes in tariffs and service regulations 
on march   ncng filed an application with the ncuc requesting an increase in rates and charges along with changes in cost allocations and rate design and changes in tariffs and service regulations 
on september  a settlement agreement supported by all parties in the proceeding was filed with the ncuc 
the agreement provided for  among other things  an annual increase in ncng s regulatory margin of million 
the ncuc issued an order in accordance with the agreement on october  effective november  on april   we filed an application with the tra requesting an annual increase in revenues along with changes in cost allocations and rate design and changes in tariffs and service regulations 
on september  a settlement agreement with the tennessee consumer advocate was filed with the tra that  among other things  increased revenues by million annually 
on september  the tra approved the settlement agreement and authorized us to increase rates  effective november  on october   we filed a joint motion for clarification of the right of easternnc to defer and collect its operations and maintenance expenses under prior ncuc orders 
as part of easternnc s certificate authorization  the ncuc recognized that easternnc would not have a sufficient customer base from which to immediately collect its operations and maintenance expenses 
the ncuc allowed easternnc to defer its operations and maintenance expenses for up to eight years or until the first rate case order 
the ncuc set the cap on deferred expenses at million 
on december   the ncuc confirmed that these deferred expenses should be treated as a regulatory asset for future recovery from customers to the extent they are deemed prudent and proper 
operations and maintenance costs totaling million  including those expensed prior to september   have been deferred as a regulatory asset 
secondary market transactions permit us to market gas supplies and transportation services by contract with wholesale or off system customers 
these sales contribute smaller per unit wholesale margins to earnings  however  the program allows us to act as a wholesale marketer of natural gas and transportation capacity in order to generate operating margin from sources not restricted by the capacity of our retail distribution system 
in north carolina  a sharing mechanism is in effect where of any margin earned is refunded to customers 
in connection with the south carolina rate case noted above  this same sharing mechanism is in place in south carolina effective november  secondary market transactions in tennessee are included in the performance incentive plan discussed above 
in  of gas deliveries were made to industrial or large commercial customers which have the capability to burn a fuel other than natural gas 
the alternative fuels are primarily fuel oil and propane and  to a much lesser extent  coal or wood 
the ability to maintain or increase deliveries of gas to these customers depends on a number of factors  including weather conditions  governmental regulations  the price of gas from suppliers and the price of alternate fuels 
under existing regulations of the ferc  certain large volume customers located in proximity to the interstate pipelines delivering gas to us could attempt to bypass us and take delivery directly from the pipeline or from a third party connecting with the pipeline 
to date  only minimal bypass activity has been experienced  in part because of our ability to negotiate competitive rates and service terms 
the future level of bypass activity cannot be predicted 
in  we requested special accounting treatment from the ncuc  the pscsc and the tra to allow us to defer for recovery in future rates the amounts of accounts receivable that were written off as uncollectible during in excess of amounts recovered through base rates 
these higher write offs resulted from the high gas prices and abnormally cold weather experienced during the winter season 
the pscsc and the tra approved deferral of only the gas cost portion of the excess write offs  which totaled million  for recovery under normal purchased gas cost adjustment pga procedures 
the ncuc did not approve our request 
on march   we  along with other natural gas companies in tennessee  filed a petition with the tra to allow recovery of the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts expense in excess of those allowed currently in rates under normal pga procedures 
a ruling is expected in early the outcome of this proceeding cannot be determined at this time

this threshold is not reached until all prior period losses are recovered 
earnings below the return threshold are allocated to members based on their ownership percentages 
earnings above the threshold are allocated at various percentages based on actual margin generated in four defined geographic service areas 
the earnings test is based on southstar s fiscal year ending december as of october  and  we recognized as equity earnings only the amounts that we believe have been earned as the calculation methodologies and interpretations of the operating policy that impact the members disproportionate earnings sharing percentages had not been agreed to by the members

environmental matters our three state regulatory commissions have authorized us to utilize deferral accounting  or to create a regulatory asset  in connection with environmental costs 
accordingly  we have established regulatory assets for environmental costs incurred and for estimated environmental liabilities 
in  we entered into a settlement with a third party with respect to nine manufactured gas plant mgp sites that we have owned  leased or operated and paid an amount that released us from any investigation and remediation liability 
although no such claims are pending or  to our knowledge  threatened  the settlement did not cover any third party claims for personal injury  death  property damage and diminution of property value or natural resources 
three other mgp sites that we also have owned  leased or operated were not included in the settlement 
in  in connection with the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of ncgs  we acquired the liability for potential remediation costs of an mgp site located in reidsville  north carolina 
based on a limited assessment performed by a third party on this site and its similarity to the three sites not covered by the settlement noted above  we increased our environmental liability in the fourth quarter of by million  with an offsetting increase to a regulatory asset  to reflect a liability of 
million for each of the four sites 
as of october   our undiscounted environmental liability totaled million  consisting of million for the four mgp sites and 
million for underground storage tanks not yet remediated 
this liability is not net of any anticipated recoveries 
as of october   our regulatory assets for environmental costs totaled million  net of recoveries from customers  in connection with the estimated liabilities for the mgp sites and underground storage tanks and for environmental costs incurred  primarily legal fees and engineering assessments 
the portion of the regulatory assets representing actual costs incurred is being amortized as recovered in rates from customers in all three states 
further evaluations of the mgp sites and the underground storage tank sites could significantly affect recorded amounts  however  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations 
in connection with the ncng general rate case proceeding discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the ncuc ordered an environmental regulatory liability of million be established for refund to customers over the three year period beginning november  this liability was derived from deducting deferred mgp costs from a prior payment made to ncng by its insurers

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  in our second quarter ending april  we believe that fin applies to our equity investments  all of which were acquired prior to february  we have evaluated the impact of fin on our equity method investments and concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not absorb a majority of the expected losses nor are we entitled to a majority of the residual returns 
accordingly  we believe the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold all financial instruments discussed below for purposes other than trading 
we are potentially exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the cost of gas 
exposure to interest rate changes relates to both short and long term debt 
exposure to gas cost variations relates to the wholesale supply  demand and price for natural gas 
interest rate risk we have short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds 
the level of borrowings under such arrangements varies from period to period depending upon many factors  including our investments in capital projects 
future short term interest expense and payments will be impacted by both short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
as of october   we had million of short term debt outstanding under committed bank lines of credit at a weighted average interest rate of 
during  such short term debt ranged from zero to million 
as of october   we also had outstanding borrowings of million under a commercial paper program at a weighted average interest rate of 
the carrying amount of our short term debt approximates fair value 
information as of october   about our long term debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates is presented below 
expected maturity date fair value as there of october  after total dollars in millions fixed rate long term debt average interest rate commodity price risk in the normal course of business  we utilize exchange traded contracts of various duration for the forward sales and purchase of natural gas 
we manage our gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers and financial price hedging instruments 
due to cost based rate regulation in our utility operations  we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices as substantially all changes in purchased gas costs and the costs of hedging our gas supplies are passed on to customers under gas cost recovery mechanisms
