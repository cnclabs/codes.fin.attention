item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment  and involve complex analysis 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents the amount of trade receivables that we do not expect to collect 
the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our analysis of specific individual customer balances that are past due and  from that analysis  we estimate the amount of the receivable balance that we do not expect to collect 
that estimate is based on various factors  including our experience in collecting past due amounts from the customer being evaluated  the customer s current financial condition  the current economic environment and the economic outlook for the future 
at june  our trade accounts receivable balances that were more than days past due totaled less than million 
inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange 
at june   we held products for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business with a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of approximately million 
our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are carried at the lower of cost or market value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
for purposes of evaluating the financial performance of our business segments  our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are reflected at market value 
the market value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange is based on quoted prices  when available 
our refined petroleum products inventories are traded in large fungible bulk markets pasadena  tx  new york harbor  chicago  il  tulsa  ok refining area  and los angeles  ca  and in city specific wholesale markets 
quoted market prices eg  nymex  platt s bulk  and opis wholesale are readily available for these markets 
however  quoted prices are not available from brokers for all delivery locations in which we maintain discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange 
when quoted prices are not available  the market value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange is based on the nearest quoted market price  plus quoted basis differentials to the various bulk market areas  plus the transportation cost to deliver the product from the bulk trading market to the city specific markets 
we estimate the basis differentials for certain city specific locations because we cannot secure a forward traded basis differential quote from a broker 
in those situations  our mark to market model estimates the basis differentials based on a rolling historical average  which is updated quarterly 
we utilize this valuation methodology for all inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange  along with any valuation of a related exchange imbalance with a trading partner 
at june   a per gallon change in basis differentials would have changed the fair value of our discretionary inventory held for immediate sale or exchange by approximately million 
derivative contracts 
at june   we are a party to certain derivative contracts that require us to receive and deliver physical quantities of refined petroleum products over a specified term at a specified price 
our derivative contracts are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
at june   our net unrealized losses on derivative contracts were approximately million 
the valuation of our derivative contracts is based on quoted prices  when available 
however  quoted prices are not available from brokers for all future periods and delivery locations in which we are committed to do business 
when quoted prices are not available  we estimate the values based on a combination of published market prices and estimates based on historical market conditions 
for market locations in which we have access to product via our terminals  dedicated pipeline capacity  a throughput agreement or an exchange arrangement  fair value is determined by adding the near month nymex futures quote to the appropriate basis differential and the transportation cost to deliver the product from the bulk trading location to the contract s specified delivery location 
we estimate the basis differentials for certain deferred trading months and city specific locations because we cannot secure a forward traded basis differential quote from a broker 
in those situations  our mark to market model estimates the basis differentials based on a rolling historical average  which is updated quarterly 
for our derivative contracts that settle against wholesale and retail pricing indices  we use a rolling historical average difference between the pricing index eg  department of energy national and opis wholesale indices and the related nymex futures contract utilized to manage the commodity price risk associated with the commitment 
for market locations in which we do not have access to product via our terminals  dedicated pipeline capacity  a throughput agreement or an exchange arrangement  we purchase product on a spot basis from approved vendors to satisfy our contractual obligations 
in these contracts  we are exposed to the differential between the bulk trading locations and the city specific markets  as we do not control the pipeline and terminal capacity to facilitate shipment of the physical product 
our mark to market model incorporates this basis differential to each city specific location 
at june   a per gallon change in basis differentials would have changed the fair value of our derivative contracts  exclusive of risk management contracts  by approximately million 
accrued lease abandonment 
at june   we have an accrued liability of approximately million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay  net of sublease payments we expect to receive from subleasing our vacated office space 
the valuation of our accrued lease abandonment liability is based on the timing and amount of sublease payments we expect to receive from subleasing our vacated office space 
our estimate of the timing and amount of sublease payments is based on information received from real estate brokers 
accrued transportation and deficiency agreements 
at june   we have an accrued liability of approximately million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for the estimated shortfall in volumes for the remainder of the terms of our transportation and deficiency agreements 
the valuation of our accrual for transportation and deficiency agreements is based on our estimate of the future volumes we expect to supply and ship with the counterparties to these agreements 
we estimate the future volumes based on our historical volumes supplied and shipped with the counterparties 
our accrued liability would be adjusted if our current projections of future volumes to be supplied and shipped with the counterparties indicated a significant increase or decrease in expected volumes due to changes in the scope and breadth of our supply  distribution  and marketing operations 
at june   a  barrel per day decline in our estimate of the future volumes we expect to supply and ship with the counter parties to these agreements would have increased our accrued liability by approximately million 
accrued environmental obligations 
at june   our estimate of the future environmental costs to be incurred to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations ranged from million to million 
at june   we have an accrued liability of approximately million as our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
the valuation of our accrued environmental obligations is based on our estimate of the remediation costs to be incurred in the future 
we estimate the future remediation costs based on specific site studies using enacted laws and regulations 
estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation  technology changes affecting remediation methods  alternative remediation methods and strategies  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
significant developments during the year ended june  on december   we sold our cetex pipeline system for approximately million  resulting in a loss on disposition of assets of approximately million 
for the six months ended december  and the year ended june   the cetex pipeline system generated net operating margins deficiencies of approximately million and million  respectively 
on october   we acquired for cash consideration of approximately million a terminal  including product inventory  in norfolk  virginia 
the acquired terminal provides us with additional storage  a docking facility that permits us to receive and deliver shipments off the water  and operating synergies with our existing facility in norfolk  virginia 
on may   we sold the senior subordinated notes in a private placement transaction that was exempt from registration under the federal securities act of we also entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to make an exchange offer 
on july   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to effect the exchange offer 
the registration rights agreement also required us to use our best efforts to cause the registration statement filed with respect to the exchange offer to be declared effective by october  and to consummate the exchange offer no later than december  the exchange offer was not consummated as of december  and  therefore  we incurred additional interest of per annum on the senior subordinated notes until the exchange offer was consummated 
on march   the registration statement on form s was declared effective by the staff of the securities and exchange commission and the exchange offer was consummated on april  subsequent events on september   we entered into a new million senior secured working capital credit facility among transmontaigne  wachovia bank  national association  as agent  a syndicate of seventeen banks and other institutional lenders  jpmorgan chase bank and ubs ag stamford branch  as syndication agents  and soci t g n rale  new york branch  and wells fargo foothill  llc  as documentation agents 
our operating subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured working capital credit facility 
the senior secured working capital credit facility replaces our former million working capital credit facility 
the senior secured working capital credit facility matures on september  the senior secured working capital credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to the lesser of i million and ii the borrowing base  which is a function  among other things  of our cash  accounts receivable  refined petroleum product inventory  exchanges  margin deposits and open positions of derivative contracts 
the borrowing base is also subject to reduction for certain reserves and  until certain fixed assets satisfying the requirements of the senior secured working capital credit facility have been granted as security for our obligations  the borrowing base will be subject to a further reduction of million 
in addition  outstanding letters of credit are counted against the maximum borrowing capacity available at any time 
the senior secured working capital credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness  limitations on dividends and other distributions  limitations on certain inter company transactions  limitations on mergers  consolidation and the disposition of assets  limitations on investments and acquisitions and limitations on liens that are customary for a facility of this nature 
the senior secured working capital credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties including those relating to corporate organization and authorization  compliance with laws  absence of defaults  material agreements and litigation and customary events of default including those relating to monetary defaults  covenant defaults  cross defaults and bankruptcy events 
the only financial covenant contained in the senior secured working capital credit facility is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test that is tested on a quarterly basis only if the average minimum unused credit line falls below million for the last month of any quarter 
results of operations market conditions prices for refined petroleum products increased significantly during the year ended june   resulting in higher per unit revenues from the sales of refined petroleum products 
prices for unleaded gasoline in the bulk market increased throughout the year from approximately per gallon to in excess of per gallon 
prices for distillates in the bulk market increased throughout the year from approximately per gallon to in excess of per gallon 
the increase in commodity prices resulted in us distributing and transporting fewer barrels of discretionary inventories for immediate sale or exchange through our terminal infrastructure during the year ended june   resulting in lower inventory volumes available for rack spot sales 
we were unable to maintain and hold larger inventory volumes due to an under sized commitment under our former working capital credit facility 
our former working capital credit facility had a maximum committed amount of million 
on september   we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our former working capital credit facility with proceeds from our new million senior secured working capital credit facility 
the combination of steeply backwardated futures markets ie  future prices lower than current prices and refinery crack spreads at historic highs encouraged refiners to maximize production and quickly sell the refined products in the bulk markets 
the availability of supply of refined products in the bulk markets resulted in limited opportunities to exploit basis differentials in the bulk markets 
however  the unfavorable market conditions in the bulk markets were offset by the favorable margin opportunities realized on rack spot sales and contract sales at the wholesale delivery locations ie  terminal truck racks 
we believe that the uncertainties of crude oil supply caused in part by the iraq war and the increased participation of hedge funds in the futures markets resulted in a lack of correlation between the cash market and the futures market ie  the physical cash markets were driven by supply and demand  whereas  the futures markets were driven by geopolitical events and expectations 
the lack of correlation between the cash market and the futures market resulted in a significant increase in the cost of managing the commodity price risk associated with our discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange 
as a result  we currently maintain and hold fewer barrels of discretionary inventories for immediate sale or exchange to minimize our exposure to the cost of managing the commodity price risk on these volumes 
results of operations business segments under sfas no 
 we are required to report measures of profit and loss that are used by our chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer or ceo in assessing the financial performance of our business segments 
our ceo assesses the financial performance of each of our reportable segments using a financial performance measure  which we refer to as adjusted net operating margins 
terminals  pipelines  tugs and barges adjusted net operating margins our adjusted net operating margins for the terminal  pipelines  tugs and barges segment are identical to the net operating margins for such segment described under results of operations historical financial statements 
selected quarterly adjusted net operating margins for the terminal  pipelines  tugs and barges segment for each of the quarters in the years ended june   and are summarized below in thousands three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  terminals  pipelines and tugs and barges historical facilities      coastal fuels assets      net operating margins     three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  terminals  pipelines and tugs and barges historical facilities     coastal fuels assets    net operating margins     three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  terminals and pipelines historical facilities      assets disposed net operating margins      supply  distribution and marketing adjusted net operating margins our ceo assesses the adjusted net operating margins of our supply  distribution  and marketing segment using financial information that is prepared pursuant to the mark to market method of accounting 
adjusted net operating margins for the supply  distribution and marketing segment differs from net operating margins for that segment as presented in our accompanying historical statement of operations due to the treatment of our inventories discretionary volumes 
in determining our adjusted net operating margins for our supply  distribution and marketing segment  inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are reflected at fair value  which matches the treatment of our derivative and risk management contracts 
therefore  the effects of changes in the fair value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are included in adjusted net operating margins attributable to our supply  distribution and marketing segment in the period in which the fair value actually changes 
additionally  for purposes of computing our adjusted net operating margins  our discretionary inventories base operating volumes are maintained at original cost 
because our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are composed of refined petroleum products  which are commodities with established trading markets and readily ascertainable market prices  we believe that the financial performance of our supply  distribution and marketing segment can be appropriately evaluated using the mark to market method rather than the lower of cost or market method of accounting for our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange 
our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are carried at the lower of cost or market in the accompanying historical balance sheets  while our derivative and risk management contracts are carried at fair value 
as a result  if commodity prices are increasing during the end of a quarter  we may report in the accompanying historical statement of operations significant losses on derivative and risk management contracts and significant deferred gains on discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange at the end of that quarter and report significant gains on our beginning inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange when they are sold in the following quarter 
the adjusted net operating margins attributable to our supply  distribution and marketing segment declined to million in from million in and million in selected quarterly adjusted net operating margins for the supply  distribution and marketing segment for each of the quarters in the year ended june   are summarized below in thousands three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  supply  distribution and marketing light oils rack spot margins      contract margins      inventory roll cost benefit    bulk activities and other margins   heavy oils contract margins     supply chain management services margins    trading activities  net   adjusted net operating margins    the adjusted net operating margins from our rack spot sales and contract sales improved quarter over quarter during the year ended june  due principally to increasing per unit margins 
per unit margins from rack spot sales and contract sales generally are more favorable during periods of expected future declining prices as major oil companies prefer to dispose of their refined product inventories in the bulk market as opposed to shipping the inventories to interior wholesale delivery markets due to the length of in transit shipping times 
rack spot margins were million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively  on volumes of approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively 
the adjusted net operating margins from our contract sales decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in due principally to lower per unit margins on deliveries at our terminal locations 
the inventory roll cost benefit represents the decrease increase in the value of our discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange from carrying inventory to future periods in a declining rising forward price environment 
the adjusted net operating margins deficiencies from our bulk activities and other decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in due principally to i limited opportunities to harvest basis differentials in the bulk markets due to fewer independent merchants engaged in energy trading activities  ii fewer supply disruptions from refinery outages during the year ended june   and iii a lack of correlation between the cash and futures markets during the quarter ended june  the cost of managing the commodity price risk associated with our discretionary gasoline inventory volumes during may exceeded the margins recognized by approximately million as the price of gasoline in the bulk markets increased in value by approximately per gallon while the loss on the related risk management contracts was approximately per gallon 
the coastal fuels assets  which we acquired on february   contributed heavy oil margins of approximately million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively 
the adjusted net operating margins from our supply chain management services decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in due principally to unfavorable per unit margins on retail price management contracts and west coast delivered fuel price management contracts during the quarter ended june  the adjusted net operating margins from our trading activities were negatively impacted by speculative positions taken in anticipation of declining commodity prices during the quarters ended march  and june  three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  reconciliation to net operating margins adjusted net operating margins gains recognized on beginning inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange     gains deferred on ending inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange     increase in fifo cost basis of base operating inventory volumes lower of cost or market write downs on base operating inventory volumes net operating margins historical financial statements   during the year ended june   we increased the carrying amount of our base operating inventory volumes by approximately million due to higher commodity prices during as compared to selected quarterly adjusted net operating margins for the supply  distribution and marketing segment for each of the quarters in the year ended june   are summarized below in thousands three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  supply  distribution and marketing light oils rack spot margins      contract margins      inventory roll cost      bulk activities and other margins    heavy oils contract margins    supply chain management services margins    trading activities  net   adjusted net operating margins    on february   we acquired the coastal fuels assets  which contributed approximately million in heavy oils contract margins

per unit margins from rack spot sales and contract sales generally are negatively impacted during periods of expected future rising prices as major oil companies prefer to ship their refined product inventories to interior wholesale delivery markets rather than dispose of their inventories in the bulk market

supply  distribution and marketing the net operating margins from our supply  distribution and marketing operations for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the net operating margins from our supply  distribution and marketing operations are as follows in thousands years ended june  rack spot sales    contract sales    bulk sales    supply chain management services    gross sales    cost of product sold    net margin before other direct costs and expenses  other direct costs and expenses net losses on risk management activities   change in unrealized gains losses on derivative contracts  lower of cost or market write downs on base operating inventory volumes net operating margins    our supply  distribution and marketing operations typically purchase products at prevailing prices from refiners and producers at production points and common trading locations 
once we purchase these products  we schedule them for delivery to our terminals  as well as terminals owned by third parties with which we have storage or throughput agreements 
from these terminal locations  we then sell our products to customers primarily through three types of arrangements rack spot sales  contract sales  and bulk sales 
rack spot sales 
rack spot sales are sales to commercial and industrial end users  independent retailers  cruise ship operators and jobbers that do not involve continuing contractual obligations to purchase or deliver product 
rack spot sales are priced and delivered on a daily basis through truck loading racks or marine fueling equipment 
our selling price of a particular product on a particular day at a particular terminal is a function of our supply at that terminal  our estimate of the costs to replenish the product at that terminal  our desire to reduce inventory levels at that terminal that day  and other factors 
rack spot sales are recognized as revenue when the product is delivered to the customer through the truck loading rack or marine fueling equipment 
rack spot sales were approximately  million   million and  million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under rack spot sales 
contract sales 
contract sales are sales to commercial and industrial end users  independent retailers  cruise ship operators and jobbers that are made pursuant to negotiated contracts  generally ranging from one to six months in duration 
contract sales provide these customers with a specified volume of product during the agreement term 
at the customer s option  the pricing of the product delivered under a contract sale may be fixed at a stipulated price per gallon  or it may vary based on changes in published indices 
contract sales are recognized as revenue when the product is delivered to the customer through the truck loading rack or marine fueling equipment 
contract sales were approximately  million   million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under contract sales 
bulk sales 
bulk sales are sales of large quantities of product to wholesalers  distributors and marketers in major cash markets 
we also may make a bulk sale of products while the product is being transported in the common carrier pipelines or by barge or vessel 
bulk sales are recognized as revenue when the title to the product is transferred to the customer  which generally occurs upon confirmation of the terms of the sale 
bulk sales were approximately  million   million and  million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under bulk sales 
supply chain management services contracts 
we provide supply chain management services to companies and governmental entities that desire to outsource their fuel supply function and to reduce the price volatility associated with their fuel supplies 
we offer three types of supply chain management services delivered fuel price management  retail price management  and logistical supply chain management services 
sales pursuant to supply chain management services contracts were approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under supply chain management services contracts 
cost of product sold 
the cost of product sold includes the cost of the product inventory sold on a first in  first out basis  pipeline transportation and other freight costs  terminal throughput  additive and storage costs  and commissions 
cost of product sold is approximately  million   million and  million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
cost of product sold is as follows in thousands years ended june  inventory product costs    transportation and related charges    throughput  storage and related charges    other    cost of product sold    net losses on risk management activities 
our risk management strategy generally is intended to maintain a balanced position of forward sale and purchase commitments against our discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange and future contractual delivery obligations  thereby reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we evaluate our exposure to commodity price risk from an overall portfolio basis that considers the continuous movement of discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange and our obligations to deliver products at fixed prices through our sales contracts and supply chain management contracts 
our physical inventory position  which includes firm commitments to buy and sell product  is offset with risk management contracts  principally futures contracts on the nymex 
when we purchase refined petroleum products  we enter into futures contracts to sell a corresponding amount of product to protect against price fluctuations for the underlying commodity 
when we ultimately sell the underlying inventory to a customer  we unwind the related risk management contract 
in order to effectively manage commodity price risk  we must predict when we will sell the underlying product 
if we fail to accurately predict the timing of those future sales  and the product remains in our inventory longer than the expiration date of the futures contract  we must settle the old futures contract and enter into a new futures contract to manage the commodity price risk until the inventory is sold 
we refer to this as rolling the risk management contracts 
during a period of rising prices  our risk management contracts ie  short futures contracts that are entered into to reduce our risk to commodity price changes associated with our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange will decline in value resulting in a loss 
net losses on risk management activities were approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively  due principally to rising commodity prices during these periods 
lower of cost or market write downs on base operating inventory volumes 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized impairment losses of approximately million and million  respectively  due to lower of cost or market write downs on certain base operating inventory volumes due principally to declining prices at the end of a quarterly reporting period 
during the year ended june  and in prior years  we did not report any of our inventory volumes as base operating inventory volumes 
during these years our base operating inventory volumes were a component of our product linefill and tank bottom volumes 
costs and expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses are as follows in thousands years ended june  wages and employee benefits    office costs  utilities and communication charges   accounting and legal expenses    property and casualty insurance    other    selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization for the years ended june   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization for as compared to is principally related to depreciation and amortization on the coastal fuels assets and current year additions to property  plant  and equipment 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization for as compared to is principally related to depreciation and amortization on new additions to property  plant  and equipment 
during the years ended june   and  we recognized impairment losses of approximately  million and million  respectively  due to write downs on the product linefill and tank bottom volumes 
we recognized special charges of million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively  related to our corporate relocation and transition 
during the year ended june   we completed the relocation of our employees from atlanta  georgia to denver  colorado 
in connection with our corporate relocation and transition  we entered into an operating lease for new office space in denver  colorado 
accordingly  we vacated certain office space in denver  colorado during june and we vacated our excess space in atlanta  georgia during october loss on disposition of assets for the year ended june   consists of a million loss on sale of cetex pipeline system and a loss on the sale of other assets 
gain loss on the disposition of assets for the year ended june   consists of a million loss on the sale of west shore  a million gain on the sale of the norco system  a million gain on the sale of our investment in st oil company  and a million loss on the sale of other assets 
other income and expenses dividend income for the year ended june  was nil  compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in dividend income for as compared to was due principally to a lack of dividends from lion oil company 
the decrease of million in dividend income for as compared to was due principally to a decrease of million in dividends received from lion oil company and the absence of million in dividends received from west shore 
we sold a portion of our investment in west shore on july  and our remaining investment on october  interest income for the year ended june  was million  as compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  pursuant to our cash management practices  excess cash balances are used to pay down our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and commodity margin loan 
interest expense for the year ended june  was million  compared to million during the year ended june   and million during the year ended june  interest expense is as follows in thousands years ended june  senior subordinated notes   working capital credit facility   former bank credit facility   letters of credit commodity margin loan interest rate swap   term loan  senior notes  other interest expense    other financing costs for the year ended june   were million  compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in other financing costs for as compared to was due principally to the absence of a write off of debt issuance costs of million and an unrealized gain on the settlement of our interest rate swap of million  offset by an increase of approximately million in amortization of deferred debt issuance costs 
the decrease of million in other financing costs for as compared to was due principally to an unrealized gain on the settlement of our interest rate swap of million during  as compared to an unrealized loss on an interest rate swap of million during  and the absence of an early payment penalty of million  offset by an increase in the write off of debt issuance costs of million related to the repayment of our former bank credit facility and the term loan 
on february   we settled our obligations under the interest rate swap agreement when we repaid our former bank credit facility 
our former bank credit facility consisted of a million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on june  on may   we repaid the term loan with the proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes 
the term loan provided for a one time borrowing of million with a scheduled maturity of february  the proceeds from the term loan were used primarily to finance the acquisition of the coastal fuels assets 
income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the effective combined federal and state income tax rate was  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the effective combined rate for includes a provision of approximately million for a change in cumulative temporary differences 
cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting principle as a result of the consensus reached on eitf  we are no longer permitted to carry our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange at fair value nor are we permitted to carry our base operating inventory volumes at original cost adjusted for impairment write downs 
effective october   we adjusted the carrying amount of our inventories discretionary volumes to the lower of cost fifo or market pursuant to the requirements of eitf the change in the carrying amount of our inventories discretionary volumes has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting principle 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends on our series a convertible preferred stock were nil  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in the dividend resulted from a reduction in the number of shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding 
the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock included an increase in the annual dividend rate from of the liquidation value to of the liquidation value commencing january  therefore  on june   we entered into an agreement with the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock  or the preferred stock recapitalization agreement  to redeem a portion of the outstanding series a convertible preferred stock and warrants in exchange for cash  shares of common stock  and shares of a newly created and designated preferred stock  or the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  to reduce the financial impact of the scheduled increase in the dividend rate 
the preferred stock recapitalization agreement resulted in the redemption of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in exchange for the i issuance of  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock with a fair value of approximately million  ii issuance of  shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million  and iii a cash payment of approximately million 
on june   we redeemed the remaining  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants that were outstanding for a cash payment of approximately million 
preferred stock dividends on our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock were million  million and nil for the years ended june   and there were no shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding during the year ended june  the initial carrying amount of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock of approximately million will be decreased ratably over its year term until it equals its liquidation value of approximately million with an equal reduction in the amount of preferred stock dividends recorded for financial reporting purposes 
the amount of the dividend recognized for financial reporting purposes is composed of the amount of the dividend payable to the holders of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock of million  offset by the amortization of the premium on the carrying amount of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock of million 
liquidity  capital resources  and commodity price risk at june   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million  compared to million at june  the increase of million in working capital is due principally to decreased borrowings of approximately million under the former working capital credit facility offset by an approximately million decline in cash and cash equivalents 
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at june  and  we have classified the outstanding borrowings under the former working capital credit facility as a current liability because we have pledged our current assets as security for the facility 
our inventories discretionary volumes are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as current assets and are carried at the lower of cost or market 
inventories discretionary volumes are as follows in thousands june  june  amount bbls amount bbls volumes held for immediate sale or exchange    volumes held for base operations     inventories discretionary volumes     our volumes held for immediate sale or exchange generally are subject to price risk management

based on the level of our operations at june   we have established our base operating inventory volumes  exclusive of product linefill and tank bottom volumes  at approximately million barrels 
changes in our operation  such as the acquisition of additional terminals or increases in our contract sales volumes  may result in changes in the volume of our base operating inventory volumes

a single customer represented approximately million of that unrealized gain 
at june   we also had derivative contracts with that customer that were in an unrealized loss position of approximately million 
therefore  the net unrealized loss on all our derivative contracts with that customer was approximately million at june  the following table includes information about the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts with that customer for the year ended june  in thousands fair value at june   amounts realized or otherwise settled during the year  change in fair value attributable to change in commodity prices  fair value at june   capital expenditures for the year ended june   were million for terminal and pipeline facilities and assets to support these facilities 
excluding acquisitions  capital expenditures for the year ending june   are estimated to be approximately million  which includes approximately million of capital expenditures to maintain our existing facilities 
future capital expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the availability  economics and cost of appropriate acquisitions which we identify and evaluate  the economics  cost and required regulatory approvals with respect to the expansion and enhancement of existing systems and facilities  customer demand for the services we provide  local  state and federal governmental regulations  environmental compliance requirements  and the availability of debt financing and equity capital on acceptable terms 
our former working capital credit facility as in effect at june  provided for a maximum borrowing line of credit that was the lesser of i million and ii the borrowing base as defined  million at june  
the maximum borrowing amount was reduced by the amount of letters of credit that were outstanding 
the borrowing base was a function of our cash  accounts receivable  inventory  exchanges  margin deposits  open positions of derivative contracts  outstanding letters of credit  and outstanding indebtedness as defined in the facility 
at june   we had borrowings of million outstanding and letters of credit of million outstanding under the former working capital credit facility 
we also had the ability to borrow an additional million under the facility based on the borrowing base computation at june  on september   we repaid all outstanding borrowings under the former working capital credit facility with proceeds from our new million senior secured working capital credit facility 
the senior secured working capital credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit  including outstanding letters of credit  equal to the lesser of i million and ii the borrowing base which is a function  among other things  of our cash  accounts receivable  refined petroleum product inventory  exchanges  margin deposits and open positions of derivative contracts 
the borrowing base is also subject to reduction for certain reserves and  until certain fixed assets satisfying the requirements of the senior secured working capital credit facility have been granted as security for our obligations  the borrowing base will be subject to a further reduction of million 
at september   we had the ability to borrow million under the senior secured working capital credit facility based on the borrowing base at that date 
we may elect to have loans outstanding under the senior secured working capital credit facility bear interest either at a eurodollar rate based on libor  plus an applicable margin ranging from to depending on the excess of the borrowing base over the amount of borrowings outstanding  or at a base rate equal to the greater of a the federal funds rate plus and b the rate announced from time to time by wachovia bank as its prime rate  in either case  plus an applicable margin ranging up to  depending on the excess of the borrowing base over the amount of borrowings outstanding 
in addition  we will pay a commitment fee ranging from to per annum on the total amount of the unused commitments 
the principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full on the maturity date  september   or the date on which all of the lenders commitments are terminated by us  if earlier 
upon the occurrence of certain events of default  and subject to the passage of time or cure periods under certain circumstances  the lenders may accelerate and declare all or a portion of the obligations under the senior secured working capital credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
as with our former credit facility  the new senior secured working capital credit facility is our primary means of short term liquidity to finance working capital requirements 
the senior secured working capital credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness  limitations on dividends and other distributions  limitations on certain inter company transactions  limitations on mergers  consolidation and the disposition of assets  limitations on investments and acquisitions and limitations on liens that are customary for a facility of this nature 
the senior secured working capital credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties including those relating to corporate organization and authorization  compliance with laws  absence of defaults  material agreements and litigation and customary events of default including those relating to monetary defaults  covenant defaults  cross defaults and bankruptcy events 
the only financial covenant contained in the new senior secured working capital credit facility is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test that is tested on a quarterly basis whenever the average minimum unused credit line falls below million for the last month of any quarter 
in that event  we must satisfy a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is based on a defined financial performance measure within the senior secured working capital credit facility known as fixed charges ebitda 
the proforma computation of the fixed charge coverage ratio  as if the senior secured working capital credit facility had been in effect for the year ended june   is as follows three months ended year ended june  september  december  march  june  financial performance debt covenant test consolidated adjusted ebitda     maintenance capital expenditures    cash paid for refund of income taxes preferred stock dividends paid in cash    fixed charges ebitda      fixed charges for the period     fixed charge coverage ratio based on rolling four consecutive quarters reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to cash flows provided by used in operating activities consolidated adjusted ebitda     one time adjustment  per senior secured working capital credit facility inventory adjustments     interest expense  net     cash paid for refund of income taxes amortization of deferred revenue     amortization of deferred stock based compensation net change in unrealized gains losses on long term derivative contracts change in operating assets and liabilities   cash flows provided by used in operating activities  if we were to fail the fixed charge ratio covenant  or any other covenant contained in the senior secured working capital credit facility  we would seek a waiver from our lenders under such facility 
if we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders  we would be in breach of the senior secured working capital credit facility and the lenders would be entitled to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable 
in addition  a default under the senior secured working capital credit facility would trigger a cross default provision in the indenture covering our senior subordinated notes 
on may   we consummated the sale and issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and received proceeds of million net of underwriters discounts of million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering of the senior subordinated notes to repay the term loan 
the senior subordinated notes mature on june  and interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december commencing on december  the senior subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt 
upon certain change of control events  each holder of the senior subordinated notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of its notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest 
we have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash 
the amounts of our contractual obligations at june  are as follows in thousands years ending june  thereafter debt    series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  transportation and deficiency agreements additions to property  plant and equipment under contract  operating leases  net of contracted sublease rentals existing office space      vacated office space   vessel charters  terminal and pipeline capacity     property and equipment total contractual obligations to be settled in cash  see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have outstanding letters of credit with third parties in the amount of million  which expire within one year 
we believe that our current working capital position  future cash expected to be provided by operating activities  available borrowing capacity under our senior secured working capital credit facility and commodity margin loan  and our relationship with institutional lenders and equity investors should enable us to meet our planned capital and liquidity requirements through at least the maturity date of our senior secured working capital credit facility september 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk policies we are exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
we have no foreign currency exchange risks 
risk management policies have been established by our risk management committee rmc to monitor and control these market risks 
our rmc is composed primarily of our senior executives 
our rmc has responsibility for oversight with respect to our risk management policies and our audit committee of the board of directors approves the financial exposure limits 
commodity risk our earnings  cash flow and liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors beyond our control  including the supply of  and demand for refined petroleum products 
demand for refined petroleum products depends on  among other factors  changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation 
as a result  refined petroleum products experience price volatility  which directly impacts our revenues and net operating margins 
our net operating margins are not impacted as much by the absolute price of the commodities as they are by the impact that the absolute price has upon supply and demand of refined petroleum products and the related local market supply and demand imbalances 
relative month end commodity prices from june  to june  near month nymex close on the last day of the month are as follows gallon logo the value of petroleum products in any us metropolitan area is the sum of the commodity price as reflected on the nymex and the basis differential for that city specific delivery location 
the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the financial impact on transmontaigne from changes in petroleum commodity prices affected by world wide crude oil and petroleum products supply and demand disruptions eg  middle east war  opec production quotas  foreign import disruptions due to hurricanes and other weather related occurrences  foreign country work stoppages  and major refinery outages 
we generally do not manage the financial impact on us from changes in basis differentials affected by local market supply and demand disruptions eg  local pipeline delivery disruptions such as the august pipeline disruption that affected arizona markets  local refinery outages  periodic change in local government specifications for gasolines and distillates  local seasonality in product demand  and disruptions due to local weather related occurrences 
we utilize nymex futures contracts to manage the financial impact on us from changes in commodity prices due to world wide events 
we believe that the utilization of nymex futures contracts to manage commodity price risk minimizes the financial impact on transmontaigne from changes in world wide commodity prices 
except for the lack of correlation between the cash and futures markets that we experienced during the three months ended june   we believe that the historical results of our risk management strategies generally produce the financial outcomes we expect 
during periods of rising commodity prices  we expect to recognize significant net margin before other direct costs and expenses from the sale of the physical product offset by significant net losses on risk management activities resulting in overall net operating margins that are in line with expectations 
conversely  during periods of declining commodity prices  we expect to recognize minimal  if any  net margin before other direct costs and expenses from the sale of the physical product offset by significant net gains on risk management activities resulting in overall net operating margins that are  again  in line with expectations 
for the years ended june   and  we recognized net losses on risk management activities of approximately million  million and million  respectively  due principally to rising commodity prices 
our risk management strategies are designed to manage the commodity price risk associated with our discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange and derivative contracts 
our risk management strategies generally are intended to maintain a balanced position of forward sale and purchase commitments  discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange and risk management contracts  thereby reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we evaluate our exposure to commodity price risk from an overall portfolio basis that considers the continuous movement of discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange and our obligations to deliver and receive products at fixed prices through our derivative sales and purchase contracts 
our physical position  which includes physical inventory volumes and firm commitments to buy and sell product  is reconciled daily and offset with nymex futures contracts 
to the extent that we do not manage the commodity price risk relating to a portion of our inventory and commodity prices move adversely  we could suffer losses on that inventory 
if  however  prices move favorably  we would realize a gain on the sale of the inventory that we would not realize if substantially all of our inventory was managed 
at june   we were subject to commodity price risk on approximately  barrels of discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange because those barrels were not offset with risk management contracts or future contractual delivery obligations 
our risk management strategies and practices currently do not qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes 
when we purchase refined petroleum products  we generally enter into nymex futures contracts to protect against price fluctuations for the underlying commodity 
futures contracts are obligations to purchase or sell a specific volume of inventory at a fixed price at a future date 
the nymex requires an initial margin deposit to open a futures contract 
at june  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  on deposit to cover our initial margin requirements on open nymex futures contracts 
nymex futures contracts also require daily settlements for changes in commodity prices 
unfavorable commodity price changes subject us to variation margin calls that require us to make cash payments to the nymex in amounts that may be material 
at june   a per gallon unfavorable change in commodity prices would have required us to make a cash payment of approximately million to cover the variation margin 
conversely  a per gallon favorable change in commodity prices would have permitted us to receive approximately million 
we use our credit lines to fund these margin calls  but such funding requirements could exceed our ability to access capital 
we have the contractual right to request that the counter parties to our supply chain management services contracts post additional letters of credit or make additional cash deposits with us to assist us in meeting our obligations to cover our margin requirements 
when we ultimately sell the underlying inventory to a customer  we unwind the related futures contract 
if there is correlation in price changes between the forward price curve in the futures market and the value of physical products in the cash market  the net changes in our variation margin position should be offset by the net operating margins we receive when we sell the underlying discretionary inventory 
therefore  in order to effectively manage commodity price risk  we must predict when we will sell the underlying product 
if we fail to accurately predict the timing of those future sales  and the product remains in our inventory longer than the expiration date of the futures contract  we must settle the old futures contract and enter into a new futures contract to sell the product to manage the commodity price risk against the same inventory 
we refer to this as rolling the risk management contracts 
furthermore  we may be unable to precisely match the underlying product in our futures contracts with the exact type of product in our physical inventory 
to the extent that price fluctuations of the product covered by the nymex futures contract does not match the price fluctuations of the product in our physical inventory  our exposure may not be mitigated 
during the three months ended june   we reviewed our risk management strategies in light of the increase in the product volumes being delivered in our supply  marketing and distribution activities  and the significance of the overall losses we were incurring on our nymex futures contracts 
upon completion of our analysis  we concluded that our minimum volumes  which are composed of the base operating inventory volumes and product linefill and tank bottom volumes to support our operations  would be increased from approximately million barrels to approximately million barrels 
we generally do not manage the commodity price risk associated with our minimum volumes 
however  our risk management policy allows our management team the discretion to manage the commodity price risk relating to up to  barrels of our base operating inventory volumes  which would reduce the total unmanaged inventory base operating volumes and product linefill and tank bottom volumes to approximately million barrels  or to leave unmanaged up to  barrels of our discretionary inventory held for immediate sale or exchange  which would increase our total unmanaged inventory to approximately million barrels 
the principal objective of this aspect of our risk management policy is to allow management discretion to capture financial gains  or prevent financial losses  on predictable commodity price movements with respect to up to  barrels of physical product 
we decide whether to manage the commodity price risk relating to a portion of our base operating inventory or to leave a portion of our discretionary inventory held for immediate sale or exchange unmanaged depending on our expectations of future market changes 
our rmc reviews our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange  open positions in fixed price forward sale and purchase commitments  and risk management contracts on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance with our risk management policies 
fixed price forward sale and purchase commitments are subject to risks relating to market value fluctuations  as well as counter party credit and liquidity risk 
we have established procedures to continually monitor these contracts in order to minimize credit risk  including the establishment and review of credit limits  margin requirements  master net out arrangements  letters of credit and other guarantees 
at june   a per gallon unfavorable change in commodity prices relative to our open positions in derivative sales and purchase contracts and risk management contracts would have resulted in the recognition of a loss realized and unrealized of approximately million 
however  the fair value of our discretionary inventory held for immediate sale or exchange would have increased by approximately million 
the gain from the increase in the fair value of our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange may not be recognized for financial reporting purposes until those volumes have been sold to customers  which may be in an accounting period subsequent to the accounting period in which the losses on derivative contracts and risk management contracts are recognized 
interest rate risk at june   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our former working capital credit facility 
we are exposed to interest rate risk because the former working capital credit facility was a variable rate based credit facility 
our new senior secured working capital credit facility is a variable rate based credit facility 
the interest rate is based on the lender s alternate base rate plus a spread  or libor plus a spread  in effect at the time of the borrowings and is adjusted monthly  bi monthly  quarterly or semi annually 
based on the outstanding balance of our variable interest rate debt at june   and assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by basis points  the potential annual increase or decrease in interest expense is approximately million
