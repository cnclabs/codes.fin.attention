item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loan securitizations for further information on the waterfall and securitizations in general 
we began utilizing a new securitization structure in  in which we completed a concurrent net interest margin  or nim  transaction 
in a nim transaction  we sell the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate to a nim trust  which is also a qspe 
the nim trust  in turn  issues interest bearing nim note s and a nim owner trust certificate 
we sell the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate without recourse  except that we provide standard representations and warranties to the nim trust 
one or more investors purchase the nim note s for a cash price and we receive the net proceeds of the sale of the note s  together with the nim owner trust certificate in consideration of our selling the excess cashflow certificate and p certificates to the nim trust 
the nim note s entitles the holder s to receive all cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate owned by the nim trust until the holder s are paid in full  including all principal and interest 
the nim owner trust certificates entitle the holder to all cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate after the nim note s have been paid in full 
nim transactions have enabled us to generate positive upfront cash flow when we securitize our mortgage loans 
the cash proceeds that we receive when the securitization and related nim transaction close  net of funding the upfront overcollateralization  securitization and nim related costs  exceed our cost to originate the loans included in the transaction 
these transactions have yielded cash proceeds in amounts comparable to  and in most cases higher than  whole loan sales 
in the securitizations and related nim transactions we completed in and  in which the underlying securitization was structured as an off balance sheet sale under sfas no 
 we recorded the net cash proceeds generated from the sale of the nim notes as a component of our net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
under this structure  we also retained  and recorded as a component of our net gain on sale of mortgage loans  a relatively small excess cashflow certificate 
we have recorded this certificate at its estimated fair value  which has ranged from to of the securitized collateral 
conversely  beginning with our securitizations  in which the securitization will be structured as an on balance sheet financing  no gain on sale will be recorded  but rather the amount of the nim notes will be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
in short  structuring the underlying securitization as either an off balance sheet sale or an on balance sheet financing does not change the overall economics of the transaction  rather  it changes the timing of income recognition and how the securitization is recorded on our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
at the time we completed the securitizations  we recognized as revenue the following economic interests  net of related transaction costs o the cash purchase price from the sale of the nim note s issued by a nim trust  o the cash purchase price from the sale of interest only certificates  o the value of the excess cashflow certificates initially  the nim owner trust certificate that we retained  and o the cash premium we received from selling the right to service the loans being securitized 
these economic interests were recorded as net gain on sale of mortgage loans on our consolidated statement of operations 
whole loan sales 
we also sell loans  without retaining the right to service the loans  in exchange for a cash premium 
the premiums we receive from the loan sales are recorded as revenue under net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
the cash premiums ranged between to prior to reserve of the principal amount of the mortgage loans sold in this manner in other income in addition to the income and cash flows we earn from securitizations and whole loan sales  we also earn income and generate cash flows from o the net interest spread earned on mortgage loans while we hold the mortgage loans for sale the difference between the interest rate on the mortgage loan paid by the borrower less the financing costs we pay to our warehouse lenders to fund our loans  o net loan origination fees on wholesale loans and retail loans these fees are recorded as a component of net gain on sale of mortgage loans  retained excess cashflow certificates  o retained excess cashflow certificates  o distributions from delta funding residual exchange company llc the llc  a limited liability company that is not our affiliate 
we have a non voting membership interest in the llc  which entitles us to receive of the net cash flows from the llc through june and  thereafter  of the net cash flows from the llc 
we have not received our distributions since the second quarter of due to a dispute with the llc s president  which has led us to commence a lawsuit to recover all of the amounts due to us 
see item legal proceedings  and o miscellaneous interest income  including prepayment penalties received on certain of the loans we sold in securitizations prior to recent developments in march  we completed a million securitization of mortgage loans that we structured as an on balance sheet financing 
this structure recognizes the related revenue as net interest income interest income on the mortgage loans  less interest expense on the bond financing which is received over the life of the loans  instead of recording virtually all of the income upfront as a gain on sale of mortgage loans as our prior structures required under sfas no 
we plan to continue to utilize this securitization structure  which eliminates gain on sale accounting treatment  and account for all our future securitization transactions as on balance sheet financings 
consequently  income that would have otherwise been recognized upfront in as net gain on sale of mortgage loans will now be recognized as net interest income over the life of the loans 
as we transition to portfolio based accounting from gain on sale accounting  we expect to record negative earnings throughout while we build the size of our portfolio generating net interest income 
generally  the larger the portfolio of loans generating net interest income  the higher our earnings will be 
we anticipate recording positive earnings in  with the expectation of further increasing earnings in  as the size of our on balance sheet loan portfolio  and the net interest income generated from the loan portfolio  increases 
we believe structuring  and therefore accounting for  securitizations as financings will help provide a relatively more consistent source of income from these transactions in future years 
business strategy over the past few years  our core business strategy has been to increase profitability and generate cash revenues in excess of our cash expenses through an increase in our overall loan production and average loan size so that we could operate on a neutral to positive cash flow basis 
as noted above in recent developments  in  we intend to transition to portfolio lending accounting treatment from gain on sale accounting treatment by changing our securitization structure 
with this change  we have altered our business strategy slightly to focus on maximizing the size of our on balance sheet securitized loan portfolio  which we ultimately believe will maximize earnings and help provide a more consistent source of income from these transactions in future years 
as part of this strategy  we will seek to continue to increase our overall loan production 
we believe we have the necessary infrastructure in place to continue to expand loan production in both our wholesale and retail channels  without having to invest significantly in our infrastructure 
we plan to increase loan production by o increasing the number of commissioned based account executives responsible for generating new wholesale business  o continuing to provide top quality service to our network of brokers and retail clients  o maintaining our loan underwriting standards  o penetrating further our established and recently entered markets and expanding into new geographic markets  o expanding our retail loan origination capabilities through larger call centers  and o maximizing the benefits from our proprietary web based and workflow technology platform 
corporate restructuring  debt modification and debt restructuring as discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements corporate restructuring  debt modification and debt restructuring  we engaged in a series of transactions beginning in  and concluding in the third quarter of  aimed at improving our operating efficiencies and reducing our then negative cash flow 
we spent much of working on two transactions in particular  which we believe were of primary importance in this regard selling our servicing portfolio and extinguishing most of our long term debt 
o in may  we completed the transfer of our servicing portfolio to ocwen fsb  which eliminated the significant cash drain associated with making securitization advances and of servicing a highly seasoned portfolio following three successive quarters of selling the securitization servicing rights associated with newly originated mortgage loans 
o in august  we completed our second exchange offer  which extinguished substantially all of our long term debt  leaving approximately million out of million of our notes still outstanding 
in the second exchange offer  we recorded a million charge in our statement of operations 
this debt extinguishment helped us in three ways 
first  it eliminated nearly million aggregate principal amount of debt  which we otherwise would have had to repay in second  it eliminated more than million of annual interest expense that we would have had to pay to the former noteholders 
third  the ratings agencies that previously rated our notes and us withdrew their corporate ratings 
on october   we redeemed at par all of our remaining outstanding senior notes due august the aggregate redemption price  including principal and accrued interest  was approximately million 
we believe that our transfer of servicing to ocwen and the second exchange offer were essential steps in restructuring our operations and reducing our negative cash flow previously associated with our servicing operations and the notes 
home equity lending operations overview our consumer finance activities consist of originating  securitizing  selling and  prior to may  servicing non conforming mortgage loans 
these loans are primarily secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences 
once loan applications have been received  the underwriting process completed and the loans funded  we typically package the loans in a portfolio and sell the loan portfolio through a securitization or on a whole loan  servicing released basis 
in  we have begun structuring our securitizations as financings and not as sales 
see recent developments above 
we provide our customers with an array of loan products designed to meet their varying needs  using a risk based pricing strategy to develop products for various risk categories 
historically  we have offered fixed rate loan products and  to date  the majority of our loan production has been fixed rate 
as we have expanded geographically  we have also expanded our product offerings to include hybrid mortgages  in which the interest rate remains fixed for the first two or three years of the loan s term and then adjusts thereafter 
we primarily conduct our broker lending operations out of our woodbury  new york headquarters 
final underwriting approval for brokered loans is centralized in our woodbury  new york headquarters and cincinnati  ohio underwriting hub 
we conduct our retail operations out of four call centers  seven retail offices and a telemarketing hub  located in nine states 
final underwriting approval for retail loans is required from either of our retail underwriting offices in cincinnati  ohio or phoenix  arizona  which have full underwriting authority  or from our woodbury  new york headquarters 
we adhere to our best practice lending program aimed at ensuring the origination of quality loans and helping to better protect consumers 
this best practice lending program includes o fair lending initiatives aimed at ensuring that all borrowers are treated fairly and similarly regardless of race  color  creed  religion  national origin  sex  sexual orientation  marital status  age  disability and the applicant s exercise  in good faith  of any right under the consumer credit protection act  o increased oversight of mortgage brokers and closing agents  o enhanced fraud detection and protection  o enhanced plain english disclosures  and o other originations and underwriting initiatives which we believe help protect consumers

wholesale marketing 
historically  we have established and maintained relationships with brokers offering non conforming mortgage products 
typically  we initiate contact with a broker through our business development department  supervised by a senior officer with over years of sales and marketing experience in the industry 
we usually hire business development representatives  or account executives  who have contacts with brokers that originate non conforming mortgage loans within their geographic territory 
the account executives are responsible for developing and maintaining our broker network within their geographic territory by frequently visiting the broker  communicating our underwriting guidelines  disseminating new product information and pricing changes  and by demonstrating a continuing commitment to understanding the needs of the customer 
the account executives attend industry trade shows and inform us about the products and pricing being offered by competitors and new market entrants 
this information assists us in refining our programs and product offerings in order to remain competitive 
account executives are compensated with a base salary and commissions based on the volume of loans originated as a result of their efforts 
at december   we had account executives 
approval process 
before a broker becomes part of our network  the broker must go through an approval process 
once approved  brokers may begin submitting applications and or loans to us 
to be approved  a broker must o demonstrate that it the broker properly licensed and registered in the state in which the broker seeks to transact business  o submit to and pass a credit check  and o sign a standard broker agreement with us that requires brokers to  among other things abide by our fair lending policy  follow the national association of mortgage brokers best practices policies  comply with all state and federal laws  and submit only true and accurate documents and disclosures 
we also perform searches on all new brokers using a third party database that contains public and nonpublic information on individuals and companies that have incidents of potential fraud and misrepresentation 
in addition  we regularly review the performance of loans originated through our brokers 
brokered loans 
for the year ended december   our broker network accounted for billion  or  of our loan originations  compared to million  or  of our loan originations for the year ended december  and million  or  of our loan purchases and originations for the year ended december  no single broker contributed more than  or of our total loan production in the years ended december   and  respectively 
once approved  a broker may submit loan applications for prospective borrowers 
to process broker submissions  our broker originations channel is organized by geographic regions and into teams  each consisting of account executives  account managers and processors  which are generally assigned to specific brokers 
since we operate in a highly competitive environment where brokers often submit the same loan application to several prospective lenders simultaneously  we strive to provide brokers with a rapid and informed response 
account executives analyze the application and provide the broker with a preliminary approval  subject to final underwriting approval  or a denial 
in addition  brokers can obtain preliminary approvals  typically within seconds  directly from our proprietary originations software program click close r by logging in and entering the basic loan information 
once a package is received from the broker  the application is logged into click close  which automatically queues the loan to an underwriter from the team covering that geographic area and or broker 
if the application is approved by our underwriter  a conditional approval will be issued to the broker with a list of specific conditions to be met and additional documents to be supplied prior to funding the loan 
the file is then queued back to the account manager and processor  who work directly with the submitting broker to collect the requested information  meet all underwriting conditions and send out all appropriate documentation and disclosures 
in most cases  we fund loans within to days after preliminary approval of the loan application 
in the case of a denial  we will make all reasonable attempts to ensure that there is no missing information concerning the borrower or the application that might change the denial decision on the loan 
we compensate our account executives  who are the primary relationship contacts with the brokers  mainly on a commission basis 
we strive to have our account executives maintain the level of knowledge and experience integral to our commitment to providing the highest quality service for brokers 
we believe that by maintaining an efficient  trained and experienced staff  we have addressed four central factors that determine where a broker sends its business o the service and support a lender provides  o product offerings and pricing  o the turn around time  or speed with which a lender closes loans  and o the lender s knowledge concerning the broker and his business 
retail loans 
we develop retail loan leads primarily through our automated telemarketing system and our network of four call centers and seven retail offices located in nine states 
for the year ended december   the retail channel accounted for million  or  of our loan originations  compared to million  or  of our loan originations for the year ended december  and million  or  of our loan originations for the year ended december  through our marketing efforts  the retail loan channel is able to identify  locate and focus on individuals who  based on historic customer profiles  are likely customers for our products 
our telemarketing representatives identify interested customers and forward these potential borrowers to a branch manager through our click close system 
the branch managers  in turn  distribute these leads to mortgage analysts via click close by queuing the loan to a mortgage analyst s to do list in click close 
the assigned mortgage analyst discusses the applicant s qualifications and available loan products  negotiates loan terms with the borrower and processes the loan through completion 
click close is utilized to queue the loan to underwriters at the appropriate times for approvals and help to facilitate the loan application process through closing 
we compensate our mortgage analysts  who are the primary relationship contacts with our borrowers  predominantly on a commission basis 
at december   we had mortgage analysts 
loan underwriting underwriting guidelines 
we maintain written underwriting guidelines that are utilized by all employees associated with the underwriting process 
throughout our year history  these guidelines have been reviewed and updated from time to time by senior underwriters and the head of risk management 
we provide our underwriting guidelines to all of the brokers from whom we accept loan applications 
loan applications received from brokers are classified according to particular characteristics  including  but not limited to  the applicant s o ability to pay  o credit history with emphasis on the applicant s existing mortgage payment history  o credit score  o income documentation type  o lien position  o loan to value ratio  o property type  and o general stability  in terms of employment history  time in residence  occupancy and condition and location of the collateral 
we have established classifications with respect to the credit profile of the applicant  and each loan is placed into one of four letter ratings a through d  with sub ratings within those categories 
terms of loans that we make  as well as maximum loan to value ratios and debt to income ratios  vary depending on the classification of the applicant and the borrower s credit score 
loan applicants with less favorable credit ratings and or lower credit scores are generally offered loans with higher interest rates and lower loan to value ratios than applicants with more favorable credit ratings and or higher credit scores 
the general criteria our underwriting staff uses in classifying loan applicants are set forth in the following table

chapter involuntary dismissal date follows the same guidelines as chapter discharge 
we use these categories and characteristics as guidelines only 
on a case by case basis  we may determine that the prospective borrower warrants an exception from the guidelines if sufficient compensating factors exist 
examples of compensating factors we consider include the following o low debt ratio  o long term stability of employment and or residence  o excellent payment history on past mortgages  o a significant reduction in monthly expenses  or o low loan to value ratio 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our originations of first and second mortgage loans by borrower classification  along with weighted average coupons  for the periods shown and highlights the improved credit quality of our originations

the mortgage loans we originate have amortization schedules ranging from five years to years  generally bear interest at fixed rates and require equal monthly payments  which are due as of a scheduled day of each month 
substantially all of our mortgage loans are fully amortizing loans 
the principal amounts of the loans we originate generally range from a minimum of  to a maximum of  and we will lend up to of the combined loan to value ratio 
our loans are generally secured by one to four family residences  including condominiums and town houses  and these properties are usually occupied by the owner 
it is our policy not to accept commercial properties or unimproved land as collateral 
however  we will accept mixed use properties  such as a property where a portion of the property is used for residential purposes and the balance is used for commercial purposes  and we will accept small multifamily properties of five to eight units  both at reduced loan to value ratios 
we do not originate loans where any senior mortgage contains open end advance  negative amortization or shared appreciation provisions all of which could have the effect of increasing the amount of the senior mortgage  thereby increasing the combined loan to value  or ltv  and increasing the risk of the loan to us 
documentation and review 
our mortgage loan program includes o a full documentation program  o a limited documentation program  o a no income verification program for self employed borrowers  and o a stated income program 
our borrowers total monthly debt obligations which include principal and interest on the new loan and all other mortgages  loans  charge accounts and scheduled indebtedness generally are or less of the borrower s monthly gross income 
some of our borrowers will qualify using our maximum debt to income ratio of 
for loans to borrowers who are salaried employees  we require current employment information in addition to employment history 
we verify this information based on one or more of the following items written confirmation from employers  recent pay stubs  recent w tax forms  recent tax returns  bank statements and telephone confirmation from the employer 
for our limited documentation program  we require either six months of bank statements or a job letter to be submitted which contains substantially the same information one would find on a standard verification of employment form  including o job position  o length of time on job  o current salary  and o the job letter should appear on the employer s letterhead and include the telephone number and signature of the individual completing the letter on behalf of the employer 
for our no income verification program  we require proof of self employment in the same business for two years 
we only offer our stated income program  which represents a very small percentage of our loans  for better credit quality borrowers where a telephone verification is performed by an underwriter to verify that the borrower is employed 
we usually require lower combined loan to value ratios with respect to loans made under programs other than the full documentation program 
we assess a borrower s credit worthiness primarily based on the borrower s mortgage history and credit score  and we generally adjust our pricing and loan to value ratios based on many other risk parameters 
our borrowers often have either a mortgage or other credit delinquencies  b problems providing documentation required by traditional lenders  and or c collateral types that traditional lenders will not lend against 
qualification for a loan is based primarily upon our risk based pricing model and guidelines  which we have developed over our year history and our extensive database of prior loan performance 
because there are compelling circumstances with some borrowers  we employ experienced non conforming mortgage loan credit underwriters to review the applicant s credit profile and to evaluate whether an impaired credit history is a result of adverse circumstances or a continuing inability or unwillingness to meet credit obligations in a timely manner 
an applicant s credit record will often be impaired by personal circumstances  including divorce  family illnesses or deaths and temporary job loss due to layoffs and corporate downsizing 
as part of our settlement agreements with new york state regulators ie  the remediation agreement and stipulated order on consent we agreed to modify certain aspects of our underwriting guidelines 
these agreements expired in september  however  we are voluntarily abiding by these underwriting guidelines and intend to continue to originate loans in accordance with these agreements in the foreseeable future 
we have a staff of underwriters with an average of years of non conforming lending experience and five years working for us 
all underwriting functions for broker originations are conducted in our woodbury  new york headquarters and our cincinnati  ohio underwriting office 
all underwriting functions for retail originations are conducted in our retail underwriting hub  located in cincinnati  ohio  our phoenix  arizona origination center and our woodbury  new york headquarters 
we do not delegate underwriting authority to any third party 
our underwriting department functions independently of our business development and sales departments and does not report to any individual directly involved in the sales origination process 
none of our underwriters are compensated on an incentive or commission basis 
our underwriters are trained to review all components of the loan to determine its compliance with our underwriting guidelines 
we have instituted underwriting internal controls that are designed to ensure that loans are generally reviewed and approved by a minimum of two underwriters 
the underwriting department employs underwriters with different levels of experience and authority 
loans generally must receive a secondary review by an underwriter of equal or higher rank 
although the most senior underwriters do not require a secondary review in some circumstances  the vast majority of our loans are reviewed by at least two underwriters 
similarly  maximum loan amount and loan to value approval authorities are assigned to each level  ensuring that loans at the highest dollar or ltv limits we offer are reviewed and approved only by the underwriting department s most senior members 
appraisals and quality control 
we underwrite every loan submitted by thoroughly reviewing credit and by performing the following o a separate appraisal review conducted by our underwriter and or appraisal review department on appraisals that were not centrally ordered by us  and o a full compliance review  to ensure that all documents have been properly prepared  all applicable disclosures given in a timely fashion  and proper compliance with all federal and state regulations 
we require appraisals to be performed by third party  fee based appraisers or by our approved appraisers and to conform generally to current fannie mae and freddie mac secondary market requirements for residential property appraisals 
each appraisal includes  among other things  an inspection of both the exterior and interior of the subject property and data from sales within the preceding months of similar properties within the same general location as the subject property 
we perform an appraisal review on each loan prior to closing on appraisals that were not centrally ordered by us 
we do not believe that the general quality control practices of many conventional mortgage lenders  which is to perform only drive by appraisals after closings  provides sufficient protection for non centrally ordered appraisals 
as such  in addition to reviewing each of these appraisals for accuracy  we access alternate sources to validate sales used in the appraisals to determine market value 
these sources include o multiple listing services  o assessment and sales services  such as comps  inc  pace  st american and transamerica  o on line internet services such as realtor 
com  and o other sources for verification  including broker price opinions and market analyses by local real estate agents 
for quality control purposes  using the criteria that we have developed over time  we actively track and grade all appraisers from whom we accept appraisals 
we do not accept work from appraisers who have not conformed to our review standards 
after completing the underwriting and processing of a brokered loan  we schedule the closing of the loan with an approved closing attorney or settlement agent 
we hold the closing attorney or settlement agent responsible for completing the loan closing transaction in accordance with applicable law and our operating procedures 
we also require title insurance that insures our interest as a lender  and evidence of adequate homeowner s insurance naming us or our servicing agent as an additional insured party on all loans 
we perform a post funding quality control review to monitor and evaluate our loan origination policies and procedures 
the quality control department is separate from the underwriting department and reports directly to a member of senior management 
our quality control department samples at least of all loan originations and performs a full quality control re underwriting and review  the results of which are reported to senior management on a quarterly basis 
on a daily basis  should the need arise  the manager of quality control underwriting will notify senior management of any critical loan findings 
the sample of loans reviewed are selected in the following manner o all early default payments and customer complaints  o at least of the loans reviewed are selected on a random basis  and o targets  which may be based on sources of business both internal branches teams and external brokers  areas or other third parties or products perceived riskier products and newly offered products 
if any discrepancies are discovered during the review process  a senior quality control underwriter re reviews the loan and proceeds with any necessary follow up actions 
discrepancies noted by the review are analyzed and corrective actions are instituted 
a typical quality control underwriting review currently includes o obtaining a new verification of value and or photo for each property  o re verifying the credit report  o reviewing loan applications for completeness  signature  and consistency with other processing documents  o obtaining new written and or verbal verification of income and employment from employer  o obtaining new written and or verbal verification of mortgage to re verify any outstanding mortgages  if necessary  and o analyzing the underwriting and program selection decisions 
we update the quality control process from time to time as our policies and procedures change 
click close r 
click close c c is a proprietary web based system that we developed internally to streamline and integrate our origination process 
click close  or c c  opens an online channel of communications between us  brokers  borrowers and a wide range of other mortgage information sources 
we currently use c c to automate and facilitate many of our origination processes  including but not limited to o logging in and tracking applications in our retail and wholesale channels  o increasing the amount of internal loan origination processes that can be handled electronically  which reduces paper flow between account managers  loan processors and underwriters and allows us to become more paperless  o generating pre approvals utilizing our risk based pricing model  o generating stipulation sheets  preliminary disclosures and other documents  and o easy  real time supervisory oversight to ensure all applications are being worked on in a timely manner 
we are continuing to improve c c to further streamline our processes and to reduce the paper flow required throughout the mortgage origination process 
our goal is to become paperless and  ultimately  lower our cost to originate 
loan securitizations and sales we securitize or sell virtually all of the mortgage loans we originate 
as a fundamental part of our present business and financing strategy  we securitize almost all of our mortgage loans 
we may also choose to sell a small number of our loans as whole loans when we believe that market conditions present an opportunity to achieve a better return through such sales 
in  securitizations and whole loan sales comprised approximately and  respectively  of our loan sales 
securitizations 
during  we issued four securitizations totaling billion in collateral  of which we delivered a total of billion of mortgage loans during we delivered the remaining million of mortgage loans in january using a pre funding feature 
all of our securitizations received ratings on various classes of securities ranging from aaa aaa to bbb baa by s p  fitch and moody s  respectively 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our securitizations by offering size  which includes pre funded amounts  duration weighted average pass through rate and type of credit enhancement 
initial duration offering size collateral weighted average credit securitization issued millions millions pass through rate enhancement senior sub senior sub senior sub senior sub whole loan sales without recourse 
we have found that  from time to time  we can receive better economic results by selling some of our mortgage loans on a whole loan basis  without retaining servicing rights  generally in private transactions to financial institutions or consumer finance companies 
we recognize a gain or loss when we sell loans on a whole loan basis equal to the difference between the cash proceeds received for the loans and our investment in the loans  including any unamortized loan origination fees and costs 
we generally sell these loans without recourse  except that we provide standard representations and warranties to the purchasers of such loans 
in and  we sold whole loans without recourse on a servicing released basis of million and million  respectively 
loan servicing prior to may  we serviced substantially all of the loans that we originated and purchased since our inception in in january  we entered into an agreement with ocwen to transfer our servicing portfolio to it 
in may  we physically transferred our entire servicing portfolio to ocwen  and laid off our servicing staff 
we no longer service loans nor do we have a servicing operation 
we do  however  maintain several employees to assist third parties with delinquent and defaulted loans  as well as portfolio retention 
currently  ocwen services our loans while in inventory pending securitization or whole loan sale 
we make the determination to have either ocwen or other similar servicers service the loans at the time we securitize our mortgage loans 
if we choose a servicer other than ocwen  then ocwen will  on our behalf  transfer the mortgage loans electronically to the other servicer 
we anticipate that a servicing transfer can be completed within days following the close of the securitization 
we will continue to make on going determinations as to who the servicer will be on each of our securitizations 
competition as an originator of mortgage loans  we face intense competition  primarily from diversified consumer financial companies and other diversified financial institutions  mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loans  mortgage reits and finance companies 
many of these competitors in the financial services business are substantially larger  have more capital and substantially greater resources than we do  a lower cost of funds and a more established market presence that we have 
in addition  we have experienced increased competition over the internet  where barriers to entry are relatively low 
competition can take many forms  including interest rates and costs of the loan  less stringent underwriting standards  convenience in obtaining a loan  customer service  amount and term of a loan and marketing and distribution channels 
furthermore  the level of gains realized by us and our competitors on the sale of the type of loans originated has attracted additional competitors into this market  which has lowered the gains that may be realized by us on future loan sales 
in addition  efficiencies in the asset backed market have generally created a desire for even larger transactions  giving companies with greater volumes of originations a competitive advantage  including a pricing advantage 
if our competitors increase their marketing efforts to include our target market of borrowers  we may be forced to reduce the rates and fees we currently charge in order to maintain and expand our market share 
any reduction in our rates or fees could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
over the past several years  many larger finance companies  financial institutions and conforming mortgage originators have adapted their conforming origination programs and allocated resources to the origination of non conforming loans 
some of these companies have begun to offer products similar to those offered by us to customers in our target market 
for example  the government sponsored entities  fannie mae and freddie mac  have begun to adapt some of their programs to include some products similar to those offered by us  and have begun to expand their presence into the non conforming market 
these government sponsored entities have a size and cost of funds advantage that allows them to purchase loans with lower rates or fees than we are willing to offer 
a material expansion of their involvement in the market to purchase subprime loans could change the dynamics of the industry in which we operate in ways adverse to us by virtue of their size  pricing power and the inherent advantages of a government charter 
in addition  if as a result of their purchasing practices  these government sponsored entities experience higher than expected losses  overall investor perception of the subprime mortgage industry may suffer 
the entrance of these government sponsored entities and other larger and better capitalized competitors into our market may reduce our market share and or our overall level of loan originations 
we depend primarily on independent mortgage brokers for the origination of our wholesale mortgage loans  which constitute the majority of our loan production 
these independent mortgage brokers have relationships with multiple lenders and are not obligated by contract or otherwise to do business with us 
we compete with these lenders for the independent brokers business on the basis of pricing  service  loan fees  costs and other factors 
competition from other lenders could negatively affect the volume and pricing of our wholesale loans  which could reduce our loan production 
regulation we must comply with the laws and regulations  as well as judicial and administrative decisions  in all of the jurisdictions in which we are licensed to originate mortgage loans  as well as an extensive body of federal law and regulations 
our business is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
our consumer lending activities are subject to  among other laws and regulations  the following o the federal truth in lending act and regulation z including the home ownership and equity protection act of  o the equal credit opportunity act of  as amended ecoa  o the fair credit reporting act of  as amended  o the real estate settlement procedures act respa  and regulation x  o the home mortgage disclosure act  o the federal debt collection practices act  and o other federal  state and local statutes and regulations affecting our activities 
we also are subject to the rules and regulations of  and examinations by  the department of housing and urban development hud and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating  processing and underwriting loans and servicing loans prior to may 
these rules and regulations  among other things o impose licensing obligations on us  o establish eligibility criteria for mortgage loans  o prohibit discrimination  o provide for inspections and appraisals of properties  o require credit reports on loan applicants  o regulate assessment  collection  foreclosure and claims handling  investment and interest payments on escrow balances and payment features  o mandate specified disclosures and notices to borrowers  and o in some cases  fix maximum interest rates  fees and mortgage loan amounts 
failure to comply with these requirements can lead to  among other things  loss of approved status  demands for indemnification or mortgage loan repurchases  rights of rescission for mortgage loans  class action and other lawsuits  and administrative enforcement actions 
several states and local municipalities have recently enacted so called high cost mortgage laws and or regulations 
while many of these laws and regulations contain some provisions that are similar to one another  there are a variety of provisions that vary from state to state and municipality to municipality  which has significantly increased the costs of compliance 
in addition  dozens of other state and local laws and regulations are currently under consideration  with more likely to be proposed in the foreseeable future  that are intended to further regulate our industry 
many of these laws and regulations seek to impose broad restrictions on a number of commonly accepted lending practices  including some of our practices 
there can be no assurance that these proposed laws  rules and regulations  or other similar laws  rules or regulations  will not be adopted in the future 
adoption of these laws  rules and regulations could harm our business by o substantially increasing the costs of compliance with a variety of potentially inconsistent federal  state and local laws  o substantially increasing the risk of litigation or administrative action associated with complying with these proposed federal  state and local laws  particularly those aspects of such proposed laws that contain subjective  as opposed to objective  requirements  o restricting our ability to charge rates and fees adequate to compensate us for the risk associated with a portion of our loans  or o if the law  rule or regulation is too onerous  potentially limiting our ability or willingness to operate in a particular geographic area 
there are also several potential federal bills being proposed  at least one of which may provide for federal preemption over these existing and proposed state and local laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that any federal law will be passed addressing this matter  or that  if passed  it will contain a provision that preempts these state and local laws and regulations 
o in july  regulations adopted by the office of thrift supervision became effective 
these regulations eliminated the ability of state chartered financial institutions and bankers to charge prepayment penalties on alternative mortgages under the federal alternative mortgage transactions parity act  while federally regulated entities still enjoy that right 
as a result  these regulations provide a competitive disadvantage for state chartered entities  such as our company  in certain states with respect to alternative mortgages 
in september  we settled allegations by the new york state banking department  or the nysbd  and a lawsuit by the new york state office of the attorney general  or the nyoag  alleging that we had violated various state and federal lending laws 
the global settlement was evidenced by a a remediation agreement by and between our subsidiary  delta funding  and the nysbd  dated as of september  and b a stipulated order on consent by and among delta funding  us and the nyoag  dated as of september  as part of the settlement  among other things  we agreed to the following o we have implemented agreed upon changes to our lending practices  o we are providing reduced loan payments aggregating million to a group of borrowers identified by the nysbd  and o we created a fund managed by the nysbd and financed by the grant of  shares of our common stock 
each month  on behalf of borrowers designated by the nysbd  we make subsidy payments to the related securitization trusts 
these subsidy payments fund the difference between the original loan payments and the reduced loan payments 
as part of the second exchange offer we completed in august see note summary of regulatory settlement and note corporate restructuring  debt modification and debt restructuring to notes to the consolidated financial statements  the llc is obligated to satisfy these payment subsidies out of the cash flows generated by the mortgage related securities it owns 
if the llc s cash flows are insufficient to pay this obligation  we remain responsible to satisfy our obligations under the remediation agreement 
the proceeds of the stock fund will be used to pay borrowers and to finance a variety of consumer educational and counseling programs 
we do not manage the fund created for this purpose 
the number of shares of common stock deposited in the fund does not adjust to account for fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
changes to the market price of these shares of common stock deposited in the fund do not have any impact on our financial statements 
we did not make any additional financial commitments between the settlement date and march  or at any time thereafter 
the stipulated order on consent and the remediation agreement both expired by their terms in september we remain obligated as discussed above to continue to make subsidy payments on behalf of borrowers identified by the nysbd for so long as these borrowers continue to make payments under the applicable mortgage loans 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
environmental matters to date  we have not been required to perform any environmental investigation or clean up activities  nor have we been subject to any environmental claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will remain the case in the future 
although we primarily lend to owners of residential properties  in the course of our business  we may acquire properties securing loans that are in default 
there is a risk that we could be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at these properties  and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury and investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
in addition  the owner or former owners of a contaminated site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees including both full time and part time employees 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item properties our executive and administrative offices are located at woodbury road  woodbury  new york  where we lease approximately  square feet of office space at an aggregate annual rent of approximately million

our retail operation currently maintains four retail call centers in woodbury  new york  pittsburgh  pennsylvania  charlotte  north carolina and phoenix  arizona  and seven retail mortgage origination offices in illinois  missouri  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee and kansas 
we also maintain one telemarketing hub and one underwriting hub in ohio 
the terms of these leases vary as to duration and rent escalation provisions  with the latest expiring in item legal proceedings because the nature of our business involves the collection of numerous accounts  the validity of liens and compliance with various state and federal lending laws  we are subject  in the normal course of business  to numerous claims and legal proceedings  including class actions 
the current status of these class actions and other litigation is summarized below

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements set forth therein 
please see information regarding forward looking statements 
general we are a specialty consumer finance company that originates  securitizes and sells and  prior to may  serviced non conforming mortgage loans 
our loans are primarily secured by first mortgages on one to four family residential properties 
throughout our year operating history  we have focused on lending to individuals who generally do not satisfy the credit  documentation or other underwriting standards set by more traditional sources of mortgage credit  including those entities that make loans in compliance with conventional mortgage lending guidelines established by fannie mae and freddie mac 
we make loans to these borrowers for purposes such as debt consolidation  refinancing  education and home improvements 
our mortgage business has two principal components 
first  we make mortgage loans to individual borrowers  which is a cash and expense outlay for us  because our cost to originate a loan exceeds the fees we collect at the time we originate the loan 
at the time we originate a loan  and prior to the time we securitize or sell the loan  we either finance the loan by borrowing under a warehouse line of credit or self fund it 
second  we securitize loans and sell loans on a whole loan basis  and use the net proceeds from these transactions to repay our warehouse lines of credit and for working capital 
we traditionally have structured our securitizations as sales  which requires us to record cash and non cash revenues as gain on sale at the time the transactions are completed 
we began structuring our securitizations as financings in  which requires us to record revenues from these transactions over time 
when we sell whole loans  we record the premiums received upon sale as revenue 
summary of critical accounting policies excess cashflow certificates 
our excess cashflow certificates primarily consist of the right to receive the future excess cash flows from pools of securitized mortgage loans  in securitizations structured as off balance sheet sales 
these future excess cash flows generally consist of o the positive difference between the interest paid on the underlying mortgage loans and the interest paid on the pass through certificates sold to investors in the securitization which  when we sell net interest margin nim notes in a simultaneous transaction to the underlying securitization is only received after the nim notes are paid in full  o in most of our securitizations  prepayment penalties received from borrowers who pay off their loans generally within the first few years of their lives which  when we sell nim notes  is only received after the nim notes are paid in full  and o additional mortgage loans pledged as collateral in excess of the principal amount of certificates issued and outstanding  the overcollateralization  or o c  is designed to provide additional assurance that the securities sold in the securitization will be paid according to their terms and which we describe in greater detail under securitizations 
the excess cash flows we receive are highly dependent upon the interest rate environment  because basis risk exists between the securitization trust s assets and liabilities 
for example  in each of the securitizations that we issued since  the interest cost of the pass through certificates sold to investors is indexed against one month libor 
as a result  each month  the interest rate received by the pass through certificate holders from the securitization trust may adjust upwards or downwards as one month libor changes liability while the majority of the underlying mortgage loans in the securitization trust have a fixed note rate for at least two to three years asset 
as a result  as rates rise and fall  the amount of our excess cash flows will fall and rise  respectively  which in turn will increase or decrease the value of our excess cashflow certificates 
although we are not currently acquiring new excess cashflow certificates  we retain those that we acquired before we began to structure our securitizations as financings in in each of our securitizations in which we sold nim note s  we purchased an interest rate cap  which helps mitigate the basis risk for the approximate time that the nim notes are anticipated to be outstanding 
the accounting estimates we use to value excess cashflow certificates are a critical accounting estimate because they can materially affect our net income 
the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates requires us to forecast interest rates  mortgage principal payments  prepayments and loan loss assumptions  each of which is highly uncertain and requires a large degree of judgment 
the rate used to discount the projected cash flows is also critical in the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates 
management uses internal  historical mortgage loan performance data and published forward libor curves to value future expected excess cash flows 
we believe that the value of our excess cashflow certificates is fair  but can provide no assurance that future prepayment and loss experience  changes in libor or changes in their required market discount rate will not require write downs of our excess cashflow certificate asset 
we have written down the value of our excess cashflow certificates in the past 
write downs would reduce our income in future periods 
a more detailed discussion of our excess cashflow certificates can be found under excess cashflow certificates  net below 
accounting for hedging activities 
we do not use derivatives to speculate on interest rates 
rather  we use derivatives in conjunction with planned or existing balance sheet instruments in such a way as to alter the performance characteristics of virtually any such instrument 
authorized applications may a offset some or all of the price or income effects of the associated instrument due to interest rate changes  or b be applied with the expectation that they will serve either to enhance the yield or lower the cost relative to those that would otherwise be generated 
authorized derivatives are limited to those that trade with active secondary markets  such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and exchange traded interest rate futures contracts 
the relevant accounting guidance is the financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although this statement became effective in january  its implementation had no impact for us  because we did not hedge during the years and for the year ended december   we recorded a small hedge gain 
sfas no 
calls for all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at market value 
when used as hedges  special treatment may be permitted  but only if a hedging relationship is properly documented and qualifying criteria are satisfied 
for derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments  all gains or losses  whether realized or unrealized  are recognized in current period earnings 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on management s belief that operating income will more likely than not be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance takes into consideration our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of taxable income in the near term 
significant judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our current trend of positive operating income changes  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize all of our deferred tax assets if we believe  on a more likely than not basis  that all of the benefits of the carryforward losses and other deferred tax assets will be realized 
management believes that  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit from our deferred tax assets 
securitizations securitizations  whether structured as off balance sheet sales or on balance sheet financings  effectively provide us with a source of long term financing 
in a securitization  we pool together loans  typically each quarter  and sell these loans to a newly formed securitization trust  which is a qualified special purpose entity  or qspe 
these trusts are established for the limited purpose of buying our mortgage loans 
we carry no contractual obligation related to these trusts or the loans sold to them  nor do we have any direct or contingent liability related to the trusts  except for the standard representations and warranties typically made as part of a sale of loans on a non recourse basis 
furthermore  we provide no guarantees to investors with respect to cash flow or performance for these trusts 
the securitization trust raises cash to purchase the mortgage loans from us by selling securities to the public 
these securities  known as asset backed pass through securities  are secured  or backed  by the pool of mortgage loans purchased by the securitization trust from us 
these asset backed securities  or senior certificates  which are usually purchased by insurance companies  mutual funds and or other institutional investors  represent senior interests in the cash flows from the mortgage loans in the trust 
in our securitizations  the securitization trust issues senior certificates  which entitle the holders of these senior certificates to receive the principal collected  including prepayments of principal  on the mortgage loans in the trust 
in addition  holders receive a portion of the interest paid on the loans in the trust equal to the pass through interest rate on the remaining principal balance of the pass through certificates 
depending upon the structure  the securitization trust may also issue interest only certificates  which entitle the holders to receive payments of interest at a pre determined rate over a fixed period of time 
the securitization trust also issues a subordinate certificate or bio certificate referred to as an excess cashflow certificate  and a p certificate 
each month  the p certificate holder is entitled to receive prepayment penalties received from borrowers who payoff their loans early 
for any monthly distribution  the holder of an excess cashflow certificate receives payments only after all required payments have been made on all the other securities issued by the securitization trust 
in addition  before the holder of the excess cash flow certificate receives payments  cash flows from the excess cashflow certificates are applied in a waterfall manner as follows o first  to cover any losses on the mortgage loans in the related mortgage loan pool  because the excess cashflow certificates are subordinate in right of payment to all other securities issued by the securitization trust  o second  to reimburse the bond insurer  if any  of the related series of pass through certificates for amounts paid by or otherwise owing to that insurer  o third  to build or maintain the overcollateralization provision described below for that securitization trust at the required level by being applied as an accelerated payment of principal to the holders of the pass through certificates of the related series  o fourth  to reimburse holders of the subordinated certificates of the related series of pass through certificates for unpaid interest and for any losses previously allocated to those certificates  and o fifth  to pay interest on the related pass through certificates that was not paid because of the imposition of a cap on their pass through rates these payments are called basis risk shortfall amounts 
the overcollateralization provision is a credit enhancement that is designed to protect the securities sold to the securitization pass through investors from credit losses  which arise principally from defaults on the underlying mortgage loans 
in short  overcollateralization occurs when the amount of collateral ie  mortgage loans owned by a securitization trust exceeds the aggregate amount of senior pass through certificates 
the o c is created to absorb losses that the securitization trust may suffer  as loans are liquidated at a loss 
historically  we built up the o c typically over the first to months of a securitization with the specific timing depending upon the structure  amount of excess spread  and performance of the securitization  by utilizing the cash flows from the excess cashflow certificates to make additional payments of principal to the holders of the pass through certificates until the required o c level was reached 
beginning in our securitizations  and in each of our securitizations  we created the o c by initially selling pass through securities totaling approximately of the total amount of mortgage loans sold to the trust 
in doing so  we created the full amount of the o c required by the trust at the time we complete the securitization  instead of over time 
for example  if a securitization trust contains collateral of million principal amount of mortgage loans  we sell approximately million in senior pass through certificates 
prior to our securitization transactions  we typically issued pass through certificates for a par purchase price  or a slight discount to par with par representing the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans backing the asset backed securities 
for example  if a securitization trust contains collateral of million of mortgage loans  we typically received close to million in proceeds from the sales of these certificates  depending upon the structure we use for the securitization 
the o c is generally expressed as a percentage of the initial mortgage loan or collateral principal balance sold to the securitization trust 
the required o c is initially determined by either the rating agencies and or the bond insurer  if any  using various factors  including o characteristics of the mortgage loans sold to the trust  such as credit scores and loan to value ratios  o the amount of excess spread between the interest rate on the pool of mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust and the interest paid to the pass through certificate holders  less the servicing fee  and other related expenses such as trustee fees and bond insurer fees  if any  and o the structure of the underlying securitization eg  issuing bbb certificates creates greater credit enhancement in the securitization transaction  which generally results in a lower o c 
our securitizations have typically required an o c of between and of the initial mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust 
the required o c can increase or decrease throughout the life of the transaction depending upon subordination levels  delinquency and or loss tests and is subject to minimums and maximums  as defined by the rating agencies and or the bond insurer insuring the securitization 
in our securitizations prior to  after the o c requirement is reached  the cash flows from the excess cashflow certificates are then distributed to us as the holder of the excess cashflow certificates  in accordance with the waterfall described above 
over time  if the cash collected during the periods exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the required o c  all other required distributions have been made  and there is no shortfall in the related required o c  the excess is paid to us as holder of the excess cashflow certificate 
each securitization trust has the benefit of either a financial guaranty insurance policy from a monoline insurance company or a senior subordinated securitization structure  which helps ensure the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal of the credit enhanced investor certificate  or both 
this form of securitization is referred to as a hybrid 
in senior subordinated structures  the senior certificate holders are protected from losses by subordinated certificates  which absorb any such losses first 
in addition to this credit enhancement  the excess cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the excess cashflow certificate is used when and if it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain or maintain required overcollateralization limits 
overcollateralization is used to absorb losses prior to making a claim on the financial guaranty insurance policy or the subordinated certificates 
we began utilizing a new securitization structure in  in which we completed a concurrent net interest margin  or nim  transaction 
in a nim transaction  we sell the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate to a nim trust  which is also a qspe 
the nim trust 
in turn  issues interest bearing nim note s and a nim owner trust certificate 
we sell the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate without recourse  except that we provide standard representations and warranties to the nim trust 
one or more investors purchase the nim note s for a cash price and we receive the net proceeds of the sale of the note s  together with the nim owner trust certificate in consideration of our selling the excess cashflow certificate and p certificates to the nim trust 
the nim note s entitles the holder to be paid a specified interest rate  and further provides for all cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate to be used to pay all principal and interest on the nim note s until paid in full 
this typically occurs approximately months from the date the nim note s were issued 
the nim owner trust certificate entitles us to all cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificate and p certificate after the holder of the nim note s has been paid in full 
as such  for securitizations structured as off balance sheet sales  we classify the nim owner trust certificate on our balance sheet as an excess cashflow certificate and value the nim owner trust certificate using the same assumptions that we utilize in valuing excess cashflow certificates 
as part of a nim transaction  we were required by the rating agencies  and the nim structure itself  to fully fund the o c at closing as opposed to having it build up over time as we had in past securitizations which is why we sold senior pass through certificates totaling approximately to less than the collateral sold to the securitization trust 
we use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from selling nim note s to make up for the difference between the principal amount of the mortgage loans sold and the proceeds from selling the senior pass through certificates 
nim transactions have enabled us to generate positive upfront cash flow when we securitized our mortgage loans ie  the cash proceeds that we receive when the securitization and related nim transaction close  net of funding the upfront overcollateralization  securitization and nim costs  exceed our cost to originate the loans included in the transaction 
these transactions have yielded cash proceeds in amounts comparable to  and in most cases higher than  whole loan sales 
in the securitizations and related nim transactions we completed in and  the underlying securitization was structured as an off balance sheet sale under sfas no 
in these transactions  we recorded the net cash proceeds generated from the sale of the nim notes as a component of our net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
under this structure  we also retained  and recorded as a component of our net gain on sale of mortgage loans  a relatively small excess cashflow certificate 
we recorded this certificate at its estimated fair value  ranging from to of the securitized collateral 
conversely  beginning with our securitizations in which the securitization will be structured as an on balance sheet financing  no gain on sale will be recorded  but rather the amount of the nim notes will be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
in short  structuring the underlying securitization as either an off balance sheet sale or an on balance sheet financing does not change the overall economics of the transaction  rather  it changes the timing of income recognition and how it is recorded on our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
however  the use of portfolio based accounting structures will result in differences in our future expected results of operations as compared to historic results 
off balance sheet securitizations 
through the end of  we have structured our securitizations as off balance sheet transactions 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 we have recorded a gain on sale of mortgage loans upon completion of each such securitization 
for example  in each of the four securitizations that we issued in  we derived  and recorded as revenue  the following economic interests o we received a cash purchase price from the sale of the nim note s issued by a nim trust  to which we sold the excess cashflow certificates  o we received a cash purchase price from the sale of interest only certificates  which entitle the holders to receive payments of interest at a pre determined rate and over a fixed period of time  o we received a cash premium from selling the right to service the loans that we securitized 
this right entitles the contractual servicer to service the loans on behalf of the securitization trust  and earn a contractual servicing fee  and ancillary servicing fees  including prepayment penalties relating to the servicing rights we previously sold  in that capacity  o we retained a nim owner trust certificate  which entitles us to receive cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificates and the p certificate issued in connection with the securitization after the holder of the nim note s has been paid in full 
although the cash flows generated by excess cashflow certificates are received over time  under gaap  we must report as income at the time of the securitization the present value of all projected cash flows we expect to receive in the future from these excess cashflow certificates based upon an assumed discount rate 
our valuation of these excess cashflow certificates is primarily based on our estimate of the amount of expected losses or defaults that will take place on the underlying mortgage loans over the life of the mortgage loans  the expected amount of prepayments on the mortgage loans due to the underlying borrowers of the mortgage loans paying off their mortgage loans prior to the stated maturity  the libor forward curve  using current libor as the floor rate  and a discount rate 
while we retained an excess cashflow certificate on our million securitization completed in the quarter ended september  and our million securitization completed in the fourth quarter ended december   we did not record it as an asset and corresponding revenue item due to the securitization structure we used to maximize cash revenues 
historically  in our securitizations  we have sold pass through certificates with credit ratings from the rating agencies that were rating the securitization transactions ranging from aaa to bbb 
in our securitization completed in the third quarter of  we issued a limited principal amount of certificates rated bbb 
this structure reduced the amount of overcollateralization required  compared to a structure without a bbb certificate  because the bbb certificate replaces credit enhancement that would have otherwise been achieved solely through overcollateralization and the corresponding excess cashflow certificate 
had we not sold a bbb certificate  the same credit enhancement would have been produced through a higher overcollateralization  which would have correspondingly led to a higher valued excess cashflow certificate 
the bbb certificate made possible a lower upfront overcollateralization than if we did not sell a bbb certificate  which  in turn  resulted in our receiving higher cash proceeds from the securitization  as the senior certificates represent a larger percentage of the aggregate value of the mortgage loans sold eg  a o c results in million of certificates being sold against every million of mortgage loans purchased by the securitization trust  whereas a o c results in million of certificates being sold against every million of mortgage loans purchased by the securitization trust rating agencies and the securitization structure require us to sell more mortgage loans collateral than the amount of certificates issued 
hence  the lower the upfront overcollateralization  the greater the upfront cash proceeds received 
as a result of the cash flow needed to pay the interest on and principal amount of bbb rated certificates  coupled with less overcollateralization and based upon our gain on sale assumptions  we ascribed no value to the excess cashflow certificate that we retained in the securitizations for those two quarters 
however  if the loans underlying these securitization transactions perform better than our expectations  we will recognize excess cash flows from the excess cashflow certificates and record the cash and interest income as received 
as with all of our most recent securitization structures  we will not receive excess cash flows  if any  from the excess cashflow certificate until the nim note is paid off in full 
at the time we completed the securitizations  we recognized as revenue each of the economic interests described above  which were recorded as net gain on sale of mortgage loans in our consolidated statement of income 
our net investment in the pool of loans sold at the date of the securitization represents the amount originally paid to originate the loans  adjusted for the following o any direct loan origination costs incurred an increase in the investment and loan origination fees received a decrease in the investment in connection with the loans  which are treated as a component of the initial investment in loans  o the principal payments received  and the amortization of the net loan fees or costs  during the period we held the loans prior to their securitization  and o any gains a decrease in the investment or losses an increase in the investment we incur on any hedging instruments that we may have utilized to hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates during the period we hold the loans prior to their securitization see hedging 
we allocate our basis in the mortgage loans and excess cashflow certificates between the portion of the mortgage loans and excess cashflow certificates sold through securitization and the portion retained the nim owner trust certificate since based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of sale 
we may recognize gains or losses attributable to the changes in fair value of the excess cashflow certificates  which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as trading securities 
since there is no active market for the excess cashflow certificates  we determine their estimated fair value by discounting the expected cash flows 
on balance sheet securitizations 
beginning in the first quarter of  we completed our first on balance sheet securitization 
we intend to utilize this structure going forward 
this securitization was structured for accounting purposes as a financing under sfas no 
portfolio based accounting 
this securitization does not meet the qualifying special purpose entity criteria under sfas no 
and related interpretations because  after the loans are securitized  we have the right to repurchase from the trust up to one percent of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the securitization closing date at a fixed purchase price 
accordingly  the securitization trust and the underlying mortgage loans it owns referred to as securitized loans are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the securitized loans  therefore  effectively remain on our balance sheet  with the securitization financing replacing the warehouse financing originally associated with the securitized loans 
in this structure  no excess cashflow certificates are recorded at the time the securitization is completed 
rather  we record interest income on securitized loans and interest expense on the bonds issued in the securitization over the life of the securitization instead of recognizing a one time gain 
deferred debt issuance costs and discount related to the bonds are amortized on a level yield basis over the estimated life of the bonds 
we also add to our balance sheet the incremental direct fees and costs to originate the loans  in addition to the servicing rights sold on the mortgage loans  which are amortized on a level yield basis over the estimated life of the related loans using the interest method calculation 
because our securitizations beginning in will utilize portfolio based accounting  we expect there to be significant differences in our future results of operations  compared to historical results 
as such  we do not expect historical results will provide a particularly meaningful comparison to results 
we believe that portfolio based accounting treatment  however  more closely matches the recognition of income with the receipt of cash payments on the individual loans 
despite carrying the securitized loans and the securitization financing on our financial statements  we are generally not legally obligated to make payments to the holders of the asset backed pass through securities issued as part of our securitizations 
rather  the holders of the asset backed securities receive repayment only from the cash flows from the mortgage loans specifically collateralizing the debt 
in short  structuring securitizations as on balance sheet financings does not materially alter our contractual responsibilities in a securitization 
excess cashflow certificates  net we classify excess cashflow certificates that we receive upon the securitization of a pool of loans as trading securities 
the amount initially allocated to the excess cashflow certificates at the date of a securitization reflects their fair value 
the amount recorded for the excess cashflow certificates is reduced for distributions which we receive as the holder of these excess cashflow certificates  and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of the excess cashflow certificates we hold 
at the time each securitization transaction closes  we determine the present value of the related excess cashflow certificates which  in the securitizations we have issued since  includes nim owner trust certificates  and the underlying bio certificates and p certificates  using assumptions we make regarding the underlying mortgage loans 
the excess cashflow certificate is then recorded on our consolidated financial statements at an estimated fair value 
our estimates primarily include the following o future rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans the expected amount of prepayments on the mortgage loans due to the underlying borrowers paying off their mortgage loan prior to the loan s expected maturity  o credit losses on the mortgage loans our estimate of the amount of expected losses or defaults that will take place on the underlying mortgage loans over the life of the mortgage loans because the excess cashflow certificates are subordinated to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
consequently  any losses sustained on mortgage loans comprising a particular securitization trust are first absorbed by the excess cashflow certificates  o the libor forward curve using current libor as the floor rate our estimate of future interest rates  which affects both the rate paid to the floating rate pass through security investors primarily the one month libor index and the adjustable rate mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust which provide for a fixed rate of interest for the first or months and a six month variable rate of interest thereafter using the six month libor index  and o a discount rate used to calculate present value 
the value of each excess cashflow certificate represents the cash flow we expect to receive in the future from the certificate based upon our best estimate 
we monitor the performance of the loans underlying each excess cashflow certificate  and any changes in our estimates and any resulting changes in value of the excess cashflow certificates are reflected in the line item called excess cashflow certificate income in the quarter in which we make the change in our estimate 
although we believe that the assumptions we use are reasonable  there can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates 
in determining the fair value of each of the excess cashflow certificates  we make the following underlying assumptions regarding mortgage loan prepayments  mortgage loan default rates  the libor forward curve and discount rates a prepayments 
we base our prepayment rate assumptions upon our ongoing analysis of the performance of the mortgage pools we previously securitized  and the performance of similar pools of mortgage loans securitized by others in the industry 
we apply different prepayment speed assumptions to different loan product types because it has been our experience that different loan product types exhibit different prepayment patterns 
generally  our loans can be grouped into two loan products fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans 
with fixed rate loans  an underlying borrower s interest rate remains fixed throughout the life of the loan 
our adjustable rate loans are a hybrid between fixed and adjustable rate loans  in that the interest rate generally remains fixed  typically for the first two or three years of the loan  and then adjusts  typically every six months thereafter 
within each product type  factors other than interest rates can affect our prepayment rate assumptions 
these factors include o whether or not a loan contains a prepayment penalty  which is the amount a borrower must pay to a lender if the borrower prepays the loan within a certain time after the loan was originated 
loans containing a prepayment penalty typically are not repaid as quickly as those without a penalty  and o as is customary in our industry with adjustable rate mortgage loans  the introductory interest rate we charge to the borrower is artificially lower  between one and two full percentage points  than the rate for which the borrower would have otherwise qualified 
generally  once the interest rate begins to adjust  the interest rate payable on that loan increases  at times fairly substantially 
this interest rate increase can be exacerbated if there is an absolute increase in interest rates 
as a result of these increases and the potential for future increases  adjustable rate mortgage loans typically are more susceptible to early prepayments 
there are several reasons why a loan may prepay prior to its maturity  including  but not limited to o a decrease in interest rates  o improvement in the borrower s credit profile  which may allow the borrower to qualify for a lower interest rate loan  o competition in the mortgage market  which may result in lower interest rates being offered to the borrower  o the borrower s sale of his or her home  o the borrower s need for additional funds  and o a default by the borrower  resulting in foreclosure by the lender 
it is unusual for a borrower to prepay a mortgage loan during the first few months because o it typically takes at least several months after the mortgage loans are originated for any of the above events to occur  o there are costs involved with refinancing a loan  and o the borrower does not want to incur prepayment penalties 
the following table shows our current prepayment assumptions for the month one and peak speed 
the assumptions have not changed since september loan type month one peak speed fixed rate adjustable rate if mortgage loans prepay faster than anticipated  we will earn less income in connection with the mortgage loans and receive less excess cash flow in the future because the mortgage loans have paid off 
conversely  if mortgage loans prepay at a slower rate than anticipated  we earn more income and more excess cash flow in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flows from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
b default rate 
at december  and  on each newly issued securitization  we apply a default reserve for both fixed and adjustable rate loans sold to the securitization trusts totaling of the amount initially securitized 
we apply a default or loss rate to the excess cashflow certificate because it is the first loss piece and is subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
if defaults are higher than we anticipate  we will receive less income and less excess cash flow than expected in the future 
conversely  if defaults are lower than we expected  we will receive more income and more excess cash flow than expected in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flows from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
c libor forward curve 
the libor forward curve is used to project future interest rates  which affects both the rate paid to the floating rate pass through security investors primarily one month libor and the adjustable rate mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust a fixed rate of interest for either the first or months then a variable rate of interest thereafter using six month libor 
a significant portion of our loans are fixed rate mortgages  and a significant amount of the securities sold by the securitization trust are floating rate securities the interest rate adjusts based upon an index  such as one month libor 
as such  our excess cashflow certificates are subject to significant basis risk and a change in libor will  impact our excess spread 
if libor is lower than anticipated  we will receive more income and more excess cash flows than expected in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flows from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
conversely  if libor is higher than expected  we will receive less income and less excess cash flows than expected in the future 
in each of our securitizations in which we sold nim note s  we purchased an interest rate cap  which helps mitigate the basis risk for the approximate time that the nim notes are outstanding 
d discount rate 
we use a discount rate that we believe reflects the risks associated with our excess cashflow certificates 
because quoted market prices on comparable excess cashflow certificates are not available  we compare our valuation assumptions and performance experience to our competitors in the non conforming mortgage industry 
our discount rate takes into account the asset quality and the performance of our securitized mortgage loans compared to that of the industry and other characteristics of our securitized loans 
we quantify the risks associated with our excess cashflow certificates by comparing the asset quality and payment and loss performance experience of the underlying securitized mortgage pools to comparable industry performance 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of cash flows from excess cashflow certificates reflects increased uncertainty surrounding current and future market conditions  including without limitation  uncertainty concerning inflation  recession  home prices  interest rates and conditions in the equity markets 
we utilized a discount rate of at december  and on all excess cashflow certificates 
prior to the quarter ended september   we used an discount rate on a nim transaction we consummated in november we increased the discount rate on these excess cashflow certificates during the period that the senior nim securities remained outstanding  to account for the potentially higher risk associated with the residual cash flows expected to be received by the holder of the certificated interest in the nim trust  which was subordinated to the multiple senior securities sold in the nim transaction 
as part of the second exchange offer  all of the excess cashflow certificates that were subject to the november nim transaction were transferred to the llc 
we did not increase the discount rate on the excess cashflow certificates from our latest securitizations despite issuing nim securities because the nim securities in the most recent transactions were o issued from a single securitization as compared to the november nim transaction  which was backed by a combination of six securitizations issued between september and march resulting in more volatility or variability in determining the timing of cash flows to be received by the nim  and o issued from a new securitization as compared to the november nim transaction  which was backed by several seasoned securitization trusts 
the predictability in determining the timing of cash flows for the first two years on a newly issued securitization is typically higher than securitizations that have been outstanding for a greater period of time because defaults or losses to the trust within the first few years of issuance are typically lower and more predictable compared to a more seasoned securitization that has been outstanding for a longer period of time 
additionally  prepayment speeds are more predictable compared to more seasoned transactions  which is aided by the presence of prepayment penalties  which typically expire within the first few years after a mortgage loan is originated 
therefore  there is a higher probability in determining the timing of cash flows to the nim investor on a new issuance securitization as compared to a seasoned transaction 
at march  we sold five of our excess cashflow certificates with a carrying value of million at a discount for a cash purchase price of million 
as a result  we recorded a loss on the transaction of million 
at september   we recorded a charge to impairment of excess cashflow certificates to reflect a valuation adjustment to our excess cashflow certificates totaling million 
our change in assumptions at september   primarily reflect recent unforeseen market events relating to the terrorist attacks on september   that further accelerated an economic downturn in the us economy  and which  together with the hostilities in afghanistan and related uncertainties  we believe may have a significant adverse impact on the economy for the foreseeable future 
at march   we recorded a million charge to impairment of excess cashflow certificates to reflect a valuation adjustment to our excess cashflow certificates 
the charge relates to the timing of excess cashflow that are to be received by our excess cashflow certificates after the release or stepdown of the overcollateralization account 
in august  we sold three of our excess cashflow certificates  which had a million carrying value in the aggregate  for million in cash 
we recorded the gain earned from the sale in gain loss of excess cashflow certificates  and reduced the value of our excess cashflow certificates on our balance sheet accordingly 
the following table summarizes the excess cashflow activity for the years ended december as follows dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year    new excess cashflow certificates    net accretion amortization of excess cashflow certificates   fair value adjustments   sales   second exchange offer  balance  end of year    the second exchange offer was consummated on august  in the second exchange offer  holders of approximately million of million in principal amount of our senior secured notes and million of million in principal amount of our senior notes exchanged their notes for commensurate interests in voting membership interests in the llc  a newly formed limited liability company unaffiliated with us  to which we transferred all of the mortgage related securities previously securing the senior secured notes primarily comprised of excess cashflow certificates million 
our valuation of retained excess cashflow certificates is highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictiveness of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation model 
the assumptions we utilize  described above  are complex  as we must make judgment calls about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more complex 
in volatile markets  like those we have experienced over the past several years  there is increased risk that our actual results may vary significantly from our assumed results 
the longer the time period over which the uncertainty will exist  the greater the potential volatility for our valuation assumptions and the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
for example  assumptions regarding prepayment speeds  defaults and libor rates are used in estimating fair values of our excess cashflow certificates 
if loans prepay faster than estimated  or loan loss levels are higher than anticipated  or libor is higher than anticipated  we may be required to write down the value of such certificates 
while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable estimates using our historical loan performance and the performance of similar mortgage pools from other lenders in addition to accessing other public information about market factors such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and real estate market values  among other things these are just estimates and it is virtually impossible to predict the actual level of prepayments and losses  which are also driven by consumer behavior 
deferred tax asset as of december   we carried a net deferred tax asset of million on our consolidated financial statements 
this asset is based upon our assumed effective tax rate 
our deferred tax asset is comprised primarily of federal and state net operating losses  or nols  net of the tax impact 
at september   we reversed a valuation allowance that we had established in against our deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a gross deferred tax asset of million  a gross deferred tax liability of million and a valuation allowance of million 
management and the audit committee of the board of directors believed that the reversal was appropriate principally because of our eight consecutive quarters of profitability and positive cash flow  together with the planned retirement of all our long term unsecured debt 
we have recorded minimal taxes in our results of operations over the prior seven quarters from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of as a result of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  which was primarily generated by nols in and the reversal of the valuation allowance has two significant effects  as follows o first  we have recorded additional income equal to the amount of the valuation allowance reversal in the third quarter which was partially offset by a change in our effective tax rate reflected in our statement of income in the line item income tax benefit  and o second  going forward  our financial statements will reflect an effective income tax rate of  even though we expect to continue to pay only minimal cash taxes either alternative minimum tax amt or excess inclusion income tax  as well as minimal state taxes until our net operating losses are fully utilized 
our deferred tax asset of million consists primarily of nols  net of tax  totaling million  which can be used to offset the tax liability generated from approximately million of pre tax income the nols principally expire in  and the excess of the tax basis over book basis on our excess cashflow certificates  net of tax  of million 
non gaap presentation in  and the first two quarters of prior to our reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  our financial statements included only a minimal tax provision 
because the foregoing effects of the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may make it difficult for investors to make a meaningful period over period comparison  we have provided a non gaap presentation in addition to our gaap results to assist investors

net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher loan production resulting in a greater amount of loans securitized and sold on a whole loan basis in  compared to  partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average net gain on sale margin for the year ended december  to from in interest income 
interest income primarily represents the sum of the gross interest we earn on loans held for sale  securitization accrued bond interest income received from the securitization trust for fixed rate pass through certificates at the securitization settlement date  cash interest earned on bank accounts  and miscellaneous interest income  including prepayment penalties received on several of our securitizations prior to year ended december  interest income dollars in thousands interest earned on loans held for sale   securitization accrued bond interest   miscellaneous interest income  total interest income   interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is due to the higher average loan balance on the loans we originated and held for sale  partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate for our loans held for sale during the year ended december  and  consequently  less interest earned on these loans  compared to 
in addition  we received less prepayment penalties miscellaneous interest income and securitization bond interest in the year ended december  compared to excess cashflow certificate income 
excess cashflow certificate income primarily represents the sum of the cash we receive from our excess cashflow certificates  and the non cash mark to market of our excess cashflow certificates 
excess cashflow certificate income increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  impairment of excess cashflow certificates 
impairment of certificates represents the write down of the fair value of excess cashflow certificates

other income represents the sum of distributions from delta funding residual exchange company  llc the llc  and any other miscellaneous income 
other income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of lower income collected from the llc 
we have a non voting membership interest in the llc  which entitles us to receive of the net cash flows from the llc through june and  thereafter  of the net cash flows from the llc 
we have not received our distributions since the second quarter of due to a dispute with the llc s president  which has led us to commence a lawsuit to recover all of the amounts due to us

expenses total expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to higher payroll and related cost required to support the significant increase in our mortgage loan production 
payroll and related costs 
payroll and related costs include salaries  benefits and payroll taxes for all non production related employees and non deferrable production related employees cost 
payroll and related costs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher compensation and related payroll costs related to the increase in our staff  including payroll taxes  k match  medical benefits and related costs

interest expense includes the borrowing cost under our warehouse credit facility to finance loan originations  equipment financing and the senior notes 
year ended december  interest expense dollars in thousands interest expense on loans financed in warehouse   capital lease senior notes  other total interest expense   on october   we redeemed  at par  all of our outstanding senior notes due august the aggregate redemption price  including principal and accrued interest  was approximately million 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is due to the higher average financed balance on the loans we originated and held for sale  partially offset by a lower borrowing cost under warehouse facilities 
the average one month libor rate  which is the benchmark used to determine our cost of borrowed funds  decreased on average to for the year ended december   compared to an average of for the year ended december  the increase was partially offset by the redemption of all our outstanding senior notes in october and the corresponding interest we saved by redeeming these notes early 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of office rent  insurance  telephone  depreciation  legal reserves and fees  license fees  accounting fees  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and the provision for loan losses on the inventory of loans held for sale and recourse loans 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with higher loan production and ongoing expansion of our wholesale and retail divisions 
this was partially offset by lower depreciation expenses resulting from fully depreciated assets 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on the income reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are paid 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying current enacted tax rates 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   which was primarily related to our reversing a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and expenses for the change in our effective tax rate 
see deferred tax asset above 
for the same period in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to our obtaining a favorable resolution to tax issues for which we had previously reserved and do not expect to recur 
this was offset by a tax provision of million  which primarily related to excess inclusion income generated by our excess cashflow certificates 
excess inclusion income cannot be offset by our nols under the real estate mortgage investment trust  or remic  tax laws 
it is primarily caused by the remic securitization trust utilizing cash that otherwise would have been paid to us as holder of the excess cashflow certificate  in order to make payments to other security holders  to create and or maintain overcollateralization by artificially paying down the principal balance of the asset backed securities 
in the future  we expect to continue to incur a modest amount of excess inclusion income  which we will be unable to offset with our nols

revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily the result of two charges we incurred in that significantly reduced revenues in that year 
first  we recorded a million loss of five excess cashflow certificates sold for a cash purchase price significantly below their carrying value 
second  we recorded an adjustment to our remaining excess cashflow certificates due to changes in our valuation assumptions totaling million 
the increase in revenues in was also attributable to higher net gain on sale due to us completing securitizations  net of pre funding  of million in  compared to million in the increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in interest income from our retained excess cashflow certificates  as we transferred the majority of these certificates in connection with our second exchange offer in  and our not receiving any servicing fees following the transfer of our servicing portfolio to ocwen in may see corporate restructuring  debt modification and debt restructuring

income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december   primarily due to a special tax benefit of million related to our obtaining a favorable resolution to tax issues for which we had previously reserved and do not expect to recur 
this was offset by a tax provision of million  which was primarily related to excess inclusion income generated by our excess cashflow certificates 
in  we recorded a tax provision of million  which was primarily related to excess inclusion income

financial condition december  compared to december  cash and interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this increase was primarily related to timing of cash received and disbursed from normal operations 
accounts receivable increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this increase is primarily due to the timing of interest on mortgage loans collected by our loan servicing provider  which is paid to us in the following period 
loans held for sale  net  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this asset represents mortgage loans held in inventory awaiting either a whole loan sale or securitization 
this increase was primarily directly related to our strategy of increasing the loans in inventory to earn the additional spread income or carry for additional periods 
excess cashflow certificates  net decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to our sale of three excess cashflow certificates with an aggregate carrying value of million  and to a lesser extent the change in fair value of our excess cashflow certificates  partially offset by our recording two new excess cashflow certificates  totaling million from loans securitized during in  we did not record an excess cashflow certificate on our million third quarter and million fourth quarter securitizations due to the securitization structure we utilized

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by periods less than to to more than total year years years years operating leases     capital leases    as of december   we did not have any long term debt  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities  as defined under gaap 
liquidity and capital resources we require substantial amounts of cash to fund our loan originations  securitization activities and operations 
we have increased our working capital over the last nine quarters  mainly by generating substantial cash proceeds from our quarterly securitization and related nim transactions  as our loan originations expanded 
prior to that  however  we operated generally on a negative cash flow basis 
embedded in our current cost structure are many fixed costs  which are not likely to be significantly affected by a relatively substantial increase in loan originations 
if we can continue to originate a sufficient amount of mortgage loans and generate sufficient cash proceeds from our securitizations and sales of whole loans to offset our current cost structure and cash uses  we believe we can continue to generate positive cash flow in the next several fiscal quarters 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard 
to do so  we must generate sufficient cash from o the premiums we receive from selling nim and or interest only certificates in connection with our securitizations  o the premiums we receive from selling our mortgage servicing rights in connection with our securitizations  o the premiums we receive from selling whole loans  servicing released  o origination fees on newly closed loans  o excess cashflow certificates we retained in connection with our securitizations prior to  and o interest income we receive on our loans held for sale prior to securitization and or whole loans sales 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue generating positive cash flow in or at all 
currently  our primary uses of cash requirements include the funding of o mortgage loans held for sale which are not financed  o interest expense on warehouse lines of credit and other financing  o scheduled principal pay downs on other financing  o transaction costs  credit enhancement o c and bond discount incurred in connection with our securitization program  o general ongoing administrative and operating expenses  including the cost to originate loans  o tax payments on excess inclusion income generated from our excess cashflow certificates  and o preferred stock dividends 
historically  we have financed our operations utilizing various secured credit financing facilities  issuance of corporate debt  issuances of equity  and the sale of interest only certificates and or nim notes and mortgage servicing rights sold in conjunction with each of our securitizations to offset our negative operating cash flow and support our originations  securitizations  and general operating expenses 
currently  our primary sources of liquidity  subject to market conditions  continue to be o on balance sheet warehouse financing and other secured financing facilities  such as capital leasing  o securitizations of mortgage loans and our corresponding sale of nim certificates and or interest only certificates  depending upon the securitization structure  and mortgage servicing rights  o sales of whole loans  o cash flows from retained excess cashflow certificates  o origination fees  interest income and other cash revenues  and o utilizing nim securitizations and or selling or financing our retained excess cashflow certificates 
in addition to our common stock  as of december   we currently have outstanding series a preferred stock having an aggregate preference of million  for which we are required to pay a annual dividend  payable semi annually  commencing in july we are required to comply with restrictive covenants in connection with our series a preferred stock 
we believe we are in compliance with these covenants as of december  in connection with our financing plans for  we intend to use a portion of any such future offering proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding series a preferred stock 
we have repurchase agreements with several institutions that have purchased mortgage loans from us 
currently  some of the agreements provide for the repurchase by us of any of the mortgage loans that go to foreclosure sale 
at the foreclosure sale  we will repurchase the mortgage  if necessary  and make the institution whole 
the dollar amount of loans that were sold with recourse and are still outstanding totaled million at december  and million at december  included in accounts payable is an allowance for losses on loans sold with recourse of million at december  and million at december   respectively 
in august  we sold three of our excess cashflow certificates to a third party purchaser for million  a slight gain to our carrying value of million 
the net proceeds of this sale will be used for working capital 
we may  from time to time  if opportunities arise that we deem to be appropriate  repurchase in the open market some of our outstanding capital stock and or sell some or all of our remaining excess cashflow certificates 
on october   we redeemed  at par all of our outstanding senior notes due august the aggregate redemption price  including principal and accrued interest was approximately million 
we used our existing cash to fund the redemption transaction 
any unexercised warrants  which were issued in connection with the issuance of our senior notes on december   have expired pursuant to their terms 
see note no 
 warrants  to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
subject to our ability to execute our business strategy and the various uncertainties described above and described in more detail in forward looking statements and risk factors below  we anticipate that we will have sufficient cash flows from operations  short term funding and capital resources to meet our liquidity obligations for at least the next months 
financing facilities we need to borrow substantial sums of money each quarter to originate mortgage loans 
we have relied upon a limited number of counterparties to provide us with financing facilities to fund our loan originations 
our ability to fund current operations and accumulate loans for securitization depends to a large extent upon our ability to secure short term financing on acceptable terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to either renew or replace these warehouse facilities at their maturities at terms satisfactory to us or at all 
if we are not able to obtain financing  we will not be able to originate new loans and our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
to accumulate loans for securitization  we borrow money on a short term basis through committed secured warehouse lines of credit and committed repurchase agreements 
the material terms and features of our financing facilities in place at december  are as follows greenwich capital repurchase facility 
we have a million facility with greenwich capital financial products  inc  which bears interest based on a margin over one month libor 
this facility provides the ability to borrow against first and second lien loans and wet collateral  which are loans that have closed and have been funded  but for which we have not yet received the loan documents from the closing agent 
the facility provides the ability to borrow at the lesser of of fair market value or of the par amount of the mortgage loans between days delinquent 
mortgage loans between days delinquent may be financed at lower borrowing percentages 
in march  we increased the facility to million 
this facility expires in october and bears interest based on a margin over one month libor 
as of december   the outstanding balance under the facility was million 
citigroup warehouse line of credit 
we have a million facility with citigroup global markets  inc  which bears interest based on a margin over one month libor 
this facility provides the ability to borrow against first and second lien loans and wet collateral 
the facility provides the ability to borrow at the lesser of of fair market value or of the par amount of the mortgage loans between days delinquent 
mortgage loans between days delinquent may be financed at lower borrowing percentages 
in march  we increased the facility to million and extended the expiration date to march this facility bears interest based on a margin over one month libor 
as of december   the outstanding balance under the facility was million 
our warehouse agreements require us to comply with various operating and financial covenants 
the continued availability of funds provided to us under these agreements is subject to  among other conditions  our continued compliance with these covenants 
we believe we are in compliance with these covenants as of december  securitization financing beginning in march  we have financed  and expect to continue to finance  our mortgage loan portfolio on a long term basis by issuing asset backed securities 
we believe that issuing asset backed securities provides us a low cost method of financing our mortgage loan portfolio 
in addition  it allows us to reduce our interest rate risk on our fixed rate loans by securitizing them 
our ability to issue asset backed securities depends on the overall performance of our mortgage loans  as well as the continued general demand for securities backed by non conforming mortgages and home equity loans 
we are generally not legally obligated to make payments to the holders of the asset backed securities issued as part of our securitizations 
instead  the holders of the asset backed securities can expect repayment only from the cash flows from mortgage loans specifically collateralizing the debt 
interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
our results of operations may be significantly affected by the level of and fluctuation in interest rates  which affect our ability to earn a spread between interest received on our loans and the cost of our borrowings  including the cost of interest rate caps  if any  that are tied to various interest rate swap maturities  libor  and other interest rate spread products  such as mortgage  auto and credit card backed receivable certificates 
our profitability is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to originate loans 
a significant decline in interest rates could increase the level of loan prepayments  thereby decreasing the size of the loan servicing portfolio underlying our securitizations 
to the extent excess cashflow certificates have been capitalized on our financial statements  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require us to write down the value of such excess cashflow certificates  adversely impacting our earnings 
in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk  we periodically review our various mortgage products and identify and modify those that have proven historically more susceptible to prepayments 
however  there can be no assurance that these modifications to our product line will mitigate effectively any interest rate risk in the future 
periods of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates  and or other volatility or uncertainty regarding interest rates  also can adversely affect us by increasing the likelihood that asset backed investors will demand higher spreads than normal to offset the volatility and or uncertainty  which decreases the value of the excess cashflow certificates we receive in connection with a securitization 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income we earn  resulting from the difference between the yield we receive on loans held pending sale and the interest paid by us for funds borrowed under our warehouse facility 
in the past  from time to time  we have undertook to hedge our exposure to this risk by using various hedging strategies  including fannie mae mortgage securities  treasury rate lock contracts and or interest rate swaps 
see hedge accounting below 
fluctuating interest rates also may significantly affect the excess cash flows from our excess cashflow certificates  as the interest rate on some of our asset backed securities change monthly based on one month libor  but the collateral that backs such securities are comprised of mortgage loans with either fixed interest rates or hybrid interest rates fixed for the initial two or three years of the mortgage loan  and adjusting thereafter every six months which creates basis risk 
see excess cashflow certificate  net 
with our transition to on balance sheet portfolio securitizations in  we may undertake to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk as described below in hedge accounting 
hedge accounting we do not use derivatives to speculate on interest rates 
rather  we use derivatives in conjunction with planned or existing balance sheet instruments in such a way as to alter the performance characteristics of virtually any such instrument 
authorized applications may a offset some or all of the price or income effects of the associated instrument due to interest rate changes  or b be applied with the expectation that they will serve either to enhance the yield or lower the cost relative to those that would otherwise be generated 
authorized derivatives are limited to those that trade with active secondary markets  such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and exchange traded interest rate futures contracts 
the relevant accounting guidance is the financial accounting standard no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although this statement became effective in january  its implementation had no impact for us  because we did not hedge during the years and for the year ended december   we recorded a hedge gain of million 
sfas no 
calls for all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at market value 
when used as hedges  special treatment may be permitted  but only if a hedging relationship is properly documented and qualifying criteria are satisfied 
for derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments  all gains or losses  whether realized or unrealized  are recognized in current period earnings 
two distinct hedging types might apply to interest rate exposures fair value hedges and cash flow hedges 
the former applies to recognized assets or liabilities  where market values are subject to change as a consequence of an interest rate changes 
the latter are appropriate in connection with uncertain interest revenues or expenses associated with forthcoming periods whether as a consequence of an existing variable rate asset or liability or an intended purchase or sale 
for a fair value hedge  all gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in earnings 
in addition  the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted due to changes in the market value attributable to the risk being hedged  and this change in value is also recorded in current income 
we exercise our discretion to choose to designate the risk being hedged as a the full price change of the hedged item  b the price change due to changes in a benchmark rate which is either the risk free us treasury rate or the libor based swap rate  or c the price change due to the changes in the interest rate associated with the hedged item ie  the benchmark rate plus a credit spread  depending on the specifics of the hedge application in question 
to qualify for fair value accounting treatment o hedges must be documented at the inception of the hedge  with the objective and strategy stated  along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness  o the hedge must be expected to be highly effective  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis effectiveness measures must relate the gains or losses of the derivative to those changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are due to the risk being hedged  o if the hedged item is a portfolio of similar assets or liabilities  each component must share the risk exposure  and each item is expected to respond to the risk factor in comparable proportions  o portions of a portfolio may be hedged if they are a a percentage of the portfolio  b one or more selected cash flows  c an embedded option provided it is not accounted for as a stand alone option  d the residual value in a lessor s net investment in a direct financing or sale type lease  and o a change in the fair value of the hedged item must present an exposure to the earnings of the reporting entity 
for a cash flow hedge  derivative results are divided into the effective portion and the ineffective portion 
the ineffective component of the hedge result is realized in current income  while the effective portion is initially posted to other comprehensive income  or oci  and later re classified as income in the same time frame in which the forecasted cash flow affects earnings 
to qualify for cash flow accounting treatment o hedges must be documented at the inception of the hedge  with the objective and strategy stated  along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness  o dates or periods for the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure must be explicitly documented  o the hedge must be expected to be highly effective  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
effectiveness measures must relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows associated with the hedged item  o the forecasted transaction must be probable  and o the forecasted transaction must be made with a different counterparty than the reporting entity 
if and when hedge accounting is discontinued most likely because it is determined that the hedge no longer qualifies as being sufficiently effective the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value  with gains or losses being recorded in earnings 
inflation inflation most significantly affects our loan originations and values of our excess cashflow certificates  because of the substantial effect inflation can have on interest rates 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation

forward looking statements and risk factors except for historical information contained in the report  certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act  or pslra  of  which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in our operations and business environment  and are subject to change on a variety of important factors 
a forward looking statement may contain words such as anticipate that  believes  continue to  estimates  expects to  hopes  intends  plans  to be  will be  will continue to be  or similar words 
such statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
we caution readers that numerous important factors discussed below  among others  in some cases have caused  and in the future could cause  our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made in the report 
the following include some  but not all  of the factors or uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from our projections o our ability or inability to earn a sufficient spread between our cost of funds and our average mortgage rates to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to offset our current cost structure and cash uses  o our ability or inability to return to profitability in  after recording losses in  o the effects of interest rate fluctuations and our ability or inability to hedge effectively against these fluctuations in interest rates  the effect of changes in monetary and fiscal policies  social and economic conditions  unforeseen inflationary pressures and monetary fluctuation  o our ability or inability to originate a sufficient amount of mortgage loans  and subsequent sale or securitization of such loans  to offset our current cost structure and cash uses  o our ability or inability to continue our practice of securitizing mortgage loans held for sale  as well as our ability to utilize optimal securitization structures including the sale of nim and or interest only certificates  and the sale of servicing rights  at the time of securitization at terms favorable to us to generate sufficient cash proceeds to offset our current cost structure  o our ability or inability to continue to access lines of credit at favorable terms and conditions  including without limitation  warehouse and other credit facilities used to finance newly originated mortgage loans held for sale and our ability or inability to comply with covenants contained in these lines of credit  o the potential effect that possible conflicts with other sovereign nations  including the conflict in iraq  or terrorist acts and or threats  may have on the us economy and capital markets  and in particular the asset backed market  o the effect that the adoption of new  or amendments in  federal  state or local lending laws and regulations and the application of these laws and regulations may have on our ability to originate loans within a particular area  or to ultimately sell those loans through securitization or on a whole loan basis 
many states and local municipalities have adopted and or are considering adopting laws that are intended to further regulate our industry 
many of these laws and regulations seek to impose broad restrictions on certain commonly accepted lending practices  including some of our practices 
in addition  enacted federal  state and local laws could impact overcollateralization requirements set by the ratings agencies  which could decrease the cash proceeds we may receive from our securitizations 
o the ftc s do not call registries may limit our ability to utilize telemarketing to generate retail leads and originate retail loans  and our ability or inability to find alternative methods of generating retail leads and originating retail loans 
our marketing operations are or may become subject to various federal and state do not call list requirements 
the ftc has recently amended its rules to provide for a national do not call registry 
under these new federal regulations  consumers may have their phone numbers added to the national do not call registry 
generally  we are prohibited from cold calling anyone on that registry 
the ftc implemented this registry in these regulations may restrict our ability to market effectively our products and services to new customers 
furthermore  compliance with these regulations may prove costly and difficult  and we may incur penalties for improperly conducting our marketing activities  o costs associated with litigation and rapid or unforeseen escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance  generally including but not limited to  the adoption of new  or changes in  federal  state or local lending laws and regulations and the application of such laws and regulations  licenses  environmental compliance  the adoption of new  or changes in accounting policies and practices and the application of such polices and practices 
failure to comply with various federal  state and local regulations  accounting policies and or environmental compliance can lead to the loss of approved status  rights of rescission for mortgage loans  class action lawsuits  demands for indemnification or loan repurchases by purchasers of our loans and administrative enforcement action against us  o our ability or inability to detect misrepresentations  fraudulent information or negligent acts on the part of loan applicants  mortgage brokers  other vendors or our employees in our loan originations prior to funding and the effect it may have on our business  including potentially harming to our reputation  resulting in poorer performing loans and or demands for indemnification or loan repurchases by purchasers of our loans  among other things  o our ability or inability to continue monetizing our existing excess cashflow certificates  including without limitation  selling  financing or securitizing through nim transactions such assets  o our ability or inability to access the equity and debt markets upon terms favorable to us  or at all  if necessary to raise additional capital to fund our business  o the impact of changes in our accounting policies  including our change to on balance sheet treatment of our securitizations  o shares of our common stock available for future sale could harm our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  including shares held by members of management or previously issued in unregistered transactions  or the perception that these sales could occur  could harm prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  a substantial number of shares of our common stock will  under our employee benefit plans  be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time  and these shares of common stock will be available for sale in the public markets 
moreover  the issuance of additional shares of our common stock in the future would be available for sale in the public markets  o periods of general economic slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining real estate values 
because of our focus on credit impaired borrowers  the actual rate of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses on loans affected by the borrowers reduced ability to use home equity to support borrowings could be higher than those generally experienced in the mortgage lending industry 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  foreclosure  losses or increased costs could adversely affect our ability to securitize or sell loans in the secondary market  o increased competition within our markets  o the effect that poor servicing or collections by third party servicers who service the loans we originate  and or regulatory actions and class action lawsuits against these servicers  could have on the value of our excess cashflow certificates and or our ability to sell or securitize loans in the future  o the effect that an interruption in  or breach of  our information systems could have on our business  o our ability or inability to adapt to and implement technological changes to become and or remain competitive and or efficient  o unpredictable delays or difficulties in the development of new product programs  o the unanticipated expenses of assimilating newly acquired businesses into our structure  as well as the impact of unusual expenses from ongoing evaluations of business strategies  asset valuations  acquisitions  divestitures and organizational structures  o regulatory actions  which may have an adverse impact on our lending  and o changes in regulations issued by the office of thrift supervision may limit our ability to charge prepayment penalties on some of the mortgage loans we originate  which could have an adverse impact on our securitizations  nim transactions and excess cashflow certificates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we originate mortgage loans and then sell the mortgage loans through whole loan sales and securitizations 
as a result  our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
in turn  interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including o governmental monetary and tax policies  o domestic and international economic and political considerations  and o other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general interest rate levels between the time we originate mortgage loans and the time when we sell the mortgage loans in securitization transactions or whole loan sales can affect their value and  consequently  our net gain on sale revenue by affecting the excess spread between the interest rate on the mortgage loans and the interest rate paid on the pass through certificates issued by the securitization trusts 
if interest rates rise between the time we originate the loans and the time we sell the loans in a securitization transaction  the excess spread generally narrows  resulting in a loss in value of the loans and a lower net gain on sale for us 
since we close and fund mortgage loans at a specified interest rate with an expected gain on sale to be booked at the time of their sale  our exposure to decreases in the fair value of the mortgage loans arises when moving from a lower to a higher interest rate environment 
a higher interest rate environment results in our having higher cost of funds 
this decreases both the fair value of the mortgage loans  and the net spread we earn between the mortgage interest rate on each mortgage loan and our cost of funds under available warehouse lines of credit used to finance the loans prior to their sale in a securitization transaction 
as a result  we may experience a lower gain on sale 
the following table illustrates the impact on our earnings resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates 
historically  such a basis point increase has resulted in an approximately basis point change in the excess spread or yield 
the product of basis points in yield and the duration of years equals a basis point or change in the net gain on sale as shown below 
basis point decrease in basis point increase in description interest rates base interest rates securitization amount    net gain on sale net gain    the table below demonstrates the sensitivity  at december   of the estimated fair value of our excess cashflow certificates caused by an immediate and  respectively  adverse change in the key assumptions we use to estimate fair value fair value of excess impact to cashflow certificates earnings dollars in thousands fair value as of  increase in prepayment speed   increase in prepayment speed   increase in credit losses   increase in credit losses   increase in discount rates  increase in discount rates   increase in one and six month libor   increase in one and six month libor   these sensitivities are hypothetical and are presented for illustrative purposes only 
changes in the fair value resulting from a change in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the resulting change in fair value may not be linear 
each change in assumptions presented above was calculated independently  without changing any other assumption 
however  in reality  changes in one assumption may result in changes in another assumption  which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
for example  a change in market interest rates may simultaneously impact prepayment speeds  credit losses and the discount rate 
it is impossible to predict how one change in a particular assumption may impact other assumptions 
to reduce our financial exposure to changes in interest rates  we may hedge our mortgage loans held for sale through hedging products that are correlated to the pass though certificates issued in connection with the securitization of our mortgage loans eg  interest rate swaps see hedging 
changes in interest rates also could adversely affect our ability to originate loans and or could affect the level of loan prepayments thereby impacting the size of the loan portfolio underlying our excess cashflow certificates and  consequently  the value of our excess cashflow certificates
