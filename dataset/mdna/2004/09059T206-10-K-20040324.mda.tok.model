overview we develop needle free injection systems that improve the way patients take medications and vaccines 
in fiscal  we changed our fiscal year end from march to december the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto prepared in accordance with us gaap contained elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion and analysis explains trends in our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  unaudited and for the nine months ended december  and the nine months ended december  unaudited 
during  we had the largest number of patents granted in our history  with a total of seven patents issued in the us in addition  another eight us patents were applied for 
the patents issued and applied for reflect new technology for needle free products  as well as innovations which are extending existing technology platforms 
among the patents granted are important innovations with our single use  pre filled iject and an evolution of the iject platform to allow it to be reusable 
other patents included an evolution of the iject which has fewer parts and is easier to manufacture  as well as a high work load injector for biodefense and mass immunization 
our long term goal is to become the leading supplier of needle free injection systems to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
in  we will continue to focus our business development efforts on new and existing licensing and supply agreements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
by bundling customized needle free delivery systems with partners injectable medications and vaccines  we can enhance demand for these products in the healthcare provider and end user markets 
in  our clinical research efforts will continue to be aimed primarily at clinical research collaborations in the areas of vaccines and drug delivery 
currently  we are involved in collaborations with institutions 
in  our other research and development efforts will focus on moving our ml and our ml iject from the clinical phase to the production phase  which includes bringing on line our sterile fill capabilities 
in addition  we continue to work on product improvements to existing devices and development of products for our strategic partners 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
various factors may affect quarterly and yearly operating results including i the length of time to close product sales  ii customer budget cycles  iii the implementation of cost reduction measures  iv uncertainties and changes in product sales due to third party payer policies and proposals relating to healthcare cost containment  v the timing and amount of payments under licensing and technology development agreements  and vi the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
cash requirements for based on our financial position at december  and our projected revenues  we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures through cash requirements for are estimated to total approximately million as follows estimated cash required for operations current portion of long term debt current portion of capital leases estimated cash capital expenditures financial outlook for the twelve months ending december   we currently estimate revenues of approximately million to million and a net loss of approximately million to million  or approximately to per share based upon approximately million shares outstanding 
the estimates are based upon projected revenues from existing customers and anticipated revenues from potential new partners  which agreements we feel are likely to close during  as well as anticipated expenses for results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the fiscal year end change to december  the fiscal year ended december  is comprised of only nine months 
in order to provide a more meaningful comparison and discussion of trends in revenues and expenses  the consolidated financial data for the twelve month periods ended december  and december  are presented in the following table and the results of these two periods are used in the discussion thereafter 
year ended december  year ended december  unaudited revenue net sales of products licensing and technology fees operating expenses manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss interest income other expense net loss allocable to common shareholders basic and diluted net loss per common share shares used in per share calculations product sales increased primarily due to increased vial adapter sales to amgen 
amgen packages the vial adapter with one of their drugs for resale to the end user 
the increase was partially offset by reduced serojet sales  which were  in compared to  in we expect increased biojector sales in as a result of our continued work with the us military and the national institutes of health 
license and technology revenues decreased primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition see discussion of deferred revenue below and the recognition of a million non refundable development fee in  which was received from amgen 
this fee was received in the quarter ended december  and was to be recognized over the term of the agreement with amgen 
however  in the quarter ended march   amgen terminated its license and development agreement and  accordingly  we recognized the entire million in that quarter 
we currently have active licensing and or development agreements with serono and merial  whereas in  we also had agreements with amgen and elan 
manufacturing expense is made up of the cost of products sold and manufacturing overhead expense related to excess manufacturing capacity 
at our current facility  we do not have adequate space to add additional manufacturing lines necessary to fulfill our projected iject and other product requirements in future years 
however  we are scheduled to move to a new facility in april  at which time we will add such manufacturing capacity 
the decreased manufacturing expense in is primarily due to  of costs related to inventory scrap and obsolescence in that were not incurred in this decrease was partially offset by increased sales volume and expenses related to the start up and validation of our vial adapter line 
included in our anticipated capital expenditures are amounts to further automate and streamline certain manufacturing processes 
research and development expense in primarily relates to costs incurred in relation to the development of the iject  including sterile fill and clinical studies  the vetjet for merial and for enhancements to our vitajet spring powered product 
the million increase in research and development expense in compared to was due to approximately  in initial set up costs for our sterile fill capabilities and a  increase in amounts spent on further development of our iject product 
as discussed above  in we plan to focus on moving our ml and our ml iject from the clinical phase to the production phase  including the completion of our automated sterile fill capabilities 
the slight increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to increases in labor and legal costs being mostly offset by lower consulting costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs to remain relatively constant in compared to interest income decreased due primarily to lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances in compared to the lower cash and investment balances are due to the fact that we have not raised any capital since december and  therefore  have been utilizing existing cash and investment balances for operations 
nine months ended december  compared to nine months ended december due to the fiscal year end change to december  the fiscal year ended december  is comprised of only nine months 
in order to provide a more meaningful comparison and discussion of trends in revenues and expenses  the consolidated financial data for the nine month periods ended december  and december  are presented in the following table and the results of these two periods are used in the discussion thereafter

in addition to selling in the us  in september  serono began selling saizen for administration with the cool 
click worldwide 
license and technology revenues increased for the nine month period ended december   compared to the same period in due primarily to licensing and technology development fees received from merial during the period 
in addition to merial  we received license fees or technology development fees from serono  alkermes and elan during the period 
manufacturing expense is made up of the cost of products sold and manufacturing overhead expense related to excess manufacturing capacity 
manufacturing expense increased in the nine month period ended december  due to a increase in unit sales volumes  which was partially offset by lower unit costs for the product mix sold 
research and development expense increased by million in the period compared to the period due to increased payroll and related expenses and expenses associated with research collaborations  the development of the iject disposable product  the iject r reusable product  development of vetjet for merial and various other new product developments 
approximately  of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the period compared to the period resulted from non cash charges relating to the issuance of common stock  stock options and warrants for consulting services and the issuance of restricted stock to each current non employee director in lieu of cash compensation 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees 
interest income decreased by  in the period compared to the period as a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash and investment balances 
we did not raise any capital during the period and therefore have been utilizing our existing cash and investment balances for operations 
preferred dividends of million in the period include a million non cash charge related to the changes made to the rights of the outstanding series a preferred stock held by elan 
in connection with the agreement  dividend charges ceased on a prospective basis  beginning with the quarter ended march  liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily from private placements of securities  the exercise of stock options and warrants  proceeds received from our initial public offering in  proceeds received from a public offering of common stock in november  licensing and technology revenues and revenues from sales of products

working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities during resulted primarily from million used in operations  million used for capital expenditures and  used for other investing activities  primarily patent applications 
net accounts receivable increased to million at december  from  at december  due primarily to the timing of payments received from and shipments to amgen 
included in the balance at december   was million due from amgen related to vial adapter sales   of which was past due 
subsequent to december   we received all million due from amgen 
we do not anticipate a problem with collecting the entire amount due from amgen 
receivable from related party  current and long term  totaling  at december   relates to a three year  non interest bearing loan to our chief executive officer related to his relocation from oregon to new jersey 
the note is being forgiven over the three year term of the note  beginning january  so long as he remains our chief executive officer 
inventories of million at december  primarily include raw materials and finished goods for the vial adapter and the cool 
click product line 
we anticipate building an extra  of inventory in the first quarter of prior to our move in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply to our customers 
capital expenditures of million excluding  of equipment purchased with capital leases in were primarily for the purchase of production molds for manufacturing and production automation for sterile fill for our iject disposable product and our vial adapter product 
we anticipate spending up to a total of million in for production molds and manufacturing capabilities 
accounts payable increased to million at december  from  at december  due primarily to inventory purchases and purchases related to capital expenditures late in the quarter 
deferred revenue totaled  at december  compared to  at december  the balance at december  represents amounts received from serono and merial pursuant to the terms of their development and licensing agreements and non refundable deposits received from potential licensing partners

in november  we entered into a million loan agreement with us bank for the purpose of purchasing capital equipment  which bears interest at the prime rate at december  and is due may  at december   million was outstanding under this agreement and we had a million certificate of deposit collateralizing the loan amount 
we also have a financing commitment from us bank to convert the million loan to a five year term loan bearing interest at us bank s cost of funds rate plus prior to may  at december   this rate would have been 
interest is due monthly on this loan 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands contractual obligation payments due by period total and and and beyond long term debt capital commitments operating leases capital leases purchase order commitments new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues  inventory valuation  and long lived asset impairment 
revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  product development revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis as qualifying expenditures are incurred and licensing revenues  if separable  are recognized over the term of the license agreement 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf accounting for multiple element arrangements requires arrangements with multiple elements to be broken out as separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only if the amount due can be reliably measured and the earnings process is substantially complete 
any units that cannot be separated must be accounted for as a combined unit 
our accounting policy is consistent with eitf should agreements be terminated prior to completion or our estimates of percentage of completion be incorrect  we could have unanticipated fluctuations in our revenue on a quarterly basis 
amounts received prior to meeting recognition criteria are recorded on our balance sheet as deferred revenues and are recognized according to the terms of the associated agreements 
the balance of  at december  represents amounts received from serono and merial pursuant to their agreements and non refundable deposits received from potential licensing partners 
inventory valuation we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including the following historical and forecasted sales and usage rates  anticipated technology improvements and product upgrades  as well as other factors 
all inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices and if certain components have become obsolete 
we record valuation adjustments for inventory based on the above factors 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
long lived asset impairment we regularly evaluate our long lived assets and certain identified intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
based on these analyses  we did not recognize any impairment on our long lived assets during the periods presented 
if circumstances related to our long lived assets change  we may record an impairment charge in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included cash  cash equivalents and marketable corporate debt securities of million and federal government debt securities of million 
the debt securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
