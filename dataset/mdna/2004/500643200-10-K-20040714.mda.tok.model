executive summary we are a leading provider of recruitment and leadership development services with the broadest global presence in the recruitment industry 
our services include executive recruitment  middle management recruitment through futurestep  leadership development solutions and executive coaching 
over half of the executive recruitment searches we performed in our fiscal year were for board level  chief executive and other senior executive positions and our  clients included approximately of the fortune companies 
we have established strong client loyalty  more than of the executive recruitment assignments we performed in our fiscal were on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted previous assignments over the last three fiscal years 
to reach our objective of expanding our position as a leading provider of recruitment and leadership development services  our strategic objectives for the fiscal year and beyond include broadening our product and service offering  better coordination in global recruiting and increased operational efficiencies  expanding our market reach and presence through technology and assessment solutions and leveraging our leadership and brand name in executive recruitment 
we will continue to develop new products and services  refine our technology and aggressively market our proven global recruitment expertise 
our fee revenue increased in our fiscal year to million with increases in all regions  with the exception of europe 
the north america region experienced the largest increase in fee revenue in both executive recruitment and futurestep 
in our fiscal year  we also experienced an operating profit of million with an increase in operating income from executive recruiting of million and improved operating losses from futurestep 
our total long term debt at april  was approximately million  and our working capital increased million to approximately million at april  from million at april  cash provided by operating activities increased in our fiscal year to million as a result of improved operating results 
capital expenditure decreased in the fiscal year to million as a result of reduced spending efforts 
in our fiscal year we issued an additional million of convertible subordinated notes in lieu of interest paid in cash and million of convertible series a preferred stock in lieu of cash dividends 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  this statement required mandatorily redeemable instruments be classified as liabilities 
we adopted this statement in the first quarter of fiscal and classified our convertible mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as a liability 
the prior year balance sheet has been reclassified to conform to this statement 
we reported our accretion on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense in the current year 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is resolved 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to review these assumptions periodically in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our liability for deferred compensation and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare or obtain valuations are goodwill and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations as a percentage of fee revenue fiscal year ended april  fee revenue reimbursed out of pocket engagement expenses total revenue compensation and benefits general and administrative expenses out of pocket engagement expenses depreciation and amortization asset impairment and restructuring charges operating income loss net income loss excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges in fiscal  and  operating income loss as a percentage of fee revenue was  and  respectively

we present these amounts as alternative measures to the actual amounts 
we use these adjusted amounts to analyze our operating results since we believe that asset impairment and restructuring charges do not reflect  and make it difficult to compare  our ongoing operations year over year

as of april   we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have million of borrowings against the cash surrender value of coli contracts as of april  bearing interest primarily at variable rates
