net loans receivable increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  excluding the loans acquired in the rfc acquisition  first defiance s total loans increased by million or from december  to december  a portion of that loan growth was funded with assets from the company s investment securities portfolio  which dropped from million at december  to million at december  loans held for sale declined from million at december  to million at december   a function in lower mortgage refinance activity at the end of compared to the end of also  goodwill and other intangibles increased to million at december  from million at december   the result of recording million in goodwill and other intangibles in conjunction with the rfc acquisition 
also premises and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december the increase in loans receivable was primarily in the non residential real estate loan  home equity and improvement loan  single family residential real estate loan and commercial loan categories 
non residential real estate loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  of that increase  million related to the rfc acquisition 
home equity and improvement loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  only million of home equity and improvement loans were acquired in the rfc acquisition 
single family residential loans increased by million  or to million at december  from million at december  million of loans were acquired in the rfc acquisition 
commercial loan balances increased by million  or to million at december  from million at december  million in commercial loans were acquired in the rfc acquisition 
the decline in the company s investment portfolio is due to a combination of significant amortization of mortgage related securities due to the interest rate environment and management taking advantage of the rate environment by selling investments and realizing gains during the runoff of the portfolio was used to fund the company s significant loan growth 
the remaining million portfolio has an average duration of years 
the company s total deposits increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of 
this growth is a result of the acquisition of million of deposits as part of the rfc acquisition 
excluding the deposits acquired as part of the rfc acquisition  deposits have actually dropped by million between the end of and the end of however  million of that decline is the result of brokered certificates of deposit maturing during such cds were not renewed 
of that reduction in brokered cds  million were acquired as part of the rfc acquisition and the balance of million had been acquired in prior years by first defiance 
in addition to deposit growth  first defiance had an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements  a product that is offered to commercial deposit customers 
the balance of that product increased from million at december  to million at december  first defiance also had an increase in its fhlb advance balances  which increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in advances  which included both long term advances with call options dependent on the libor rate and short term overnight advances  was used to fund growth in the company s loan balances and for income enhancement strategies 
average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amounts of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin

the average balance of such loans was  million and million in  and while the average balance of such securities was million  million and million in  and respectively 
in order to compare the tax exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields  the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre tax equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 
at december   the yields earned and rates paid were as follows loans receivable   securities   fhlb stock   total interest earning assets   deposits   fhlb advances   other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   and interest rate spread  
interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected first defiance s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii change in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii total change in rate and volume 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume

before cumulative effect adjustment for change in accounting for goodwill and in net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the increase in the margin between and is due to an improved interest rate spread  which increased from in to in  a result the cost of interest bearing liabilities dropping basis points compared to the yield on interest earning assets  which fell by just basis points 
the margin between and also improved because of growth in non interest bearing deposits between the two periods 
the decline in net interest margin from to was due to significant growth in lower yielding interest earning assets resulting from the sale of the leader 
the proceeds from the sale were invested primarily in investment securities  which lowered the average yield on total interest earning assets 
the average balance of investment securities was million in compared to just million in the yield on those securities was in compared to in the basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets is due to an basis point decline in the yield on the company s loan portfolio from in to in the drop in loan yields was slightly offset by an improved mix of loans  securities and interest earning deposits in compared to the overall decline in rates for both assets and liabilities in compared to was due to the low rate environment that existed throughout the entire twelve month period in  the result of cuts by the federal reserve to its federal funds rate during the year 
in compared to  the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points  to from while the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points to from 
a portion of the decline in the yield on assets was due to the mix change caused by the growth in the investment securities portfolio as well as a million increase in the average balance of interest earning deposits that first defiance maintained in other banks 
the decline in rates for both assets and liabilities was due to the low level of interest rates throughout compared to  the results of cuts by the federal reserve to its federal funds rate implemented throughout the cost of brokered certificates of deposit and a portion of the cost of fhlb advances were used to finance operations of the leader throughout and the first quarter of the cost associated with those brokered certificates of deposit and advances was included in discontinued operations 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in for the year ended december   non interest income was million compared to million for and million for non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in income was due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable  to million for the twelve months of compared to million for during the same period  the average balance of investment securities increased to million from million but that increase was offset by a decline in the average balance of funds held in interest bearing accounts at other financial institutions  which dropped to million for compared to million for while the average balance of total interest earning assets including fhlb stock increased by million in compared to  the yield on those total assets fell to in from in the average balance of non residential real estate loans  multi family real estate loans  non owner occupied residential mortgage loans and commercial loans increased by million  or in  to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in these portfolios is the result of first defiance s june acquisition of branches in findlay  ottawa and mccomb  ohio from rfc banking company 
the growth was also a result of continued strong growth in this type of lending throughout first defiance s market area 
the company also had an increase in the average balance of home equity and improvement loans  which averaged million in  up from s average balance of million 
the average balance of the company s residential mortgage loan portfolio decreased  to million for compared to million for a total of million of residential mortgage loans were recorded in june as a result of the acquisition of the three banking offices 
the company s average balance of consumer loans also remained steady in  at the same million level as in a total of million in consumer loans was acquired as part of the rfc acquisition 
interest income from the investment portfolio increased slightly for  to million from million in the increase is due to a higher average balance in the portfolio in  at million for the full year  compared to million for the higher average balance for is actually due to the low average balance in the investment portfolio during the first quarter of just million prior to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the leader 
overall the balance in the portfolio declined from million at the end of to million at the end of the yield on the investment portfolio was for  a basis point drop from the yield in first defiance also had a significant decline in the balance of interest earning deposits maintained at other banks  which averaged million  a drop from the million average balance carried during those deposits were used to fund loan growth and national cd run off 
the yield on those interest bearing deposits  which is closely tied to the federal funds rate  declined to for compared to in in  total interest income declined slightly  to million from million in income from loans decreased to million in million on a tax equivalent basis compared to million in million on a tax equivalent basis 
that decline was the result of a basis point drop in the average yield on the loan portfolio as rates dropped dramatically in compared to following numerous federal reserve rate cuts in the decline in interest income from the loan portfolio was offset by a million increase in interest earnings from the investment portfolio in compared to million increase on a tax equivalent basis  the result of the average portfolio balance increasing to million in from just million in that increase was due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of leader 
earnings on interest bearing deposits held at other financial institutions also increased significantly in as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of leader 
the average balance of those deposits was million in compared to just million in the yield on those balances  which is generally tied to the fed funds rate  was in and in interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in interest expense on interest bearing deposits was million lower in compared to despite an million increase in the average balance of such deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits dropped to in from in the drop in the interest rates paid on deposits occurred in both core deposit accounts  which include money market accounts and interest bearing checking accounts  and in certificates of deposit 
the average cost of savings and interest bearing checking accounts dropped from in to in while the average cost of cds declined from to between the same time periods 
the decline in interest expense on deposits was partially offset by an increase in expense on fhlb advances  which increased to million in from million in part of the increase is due to the fact that the interest expense on approximately million of fhlb advances was allocated to discontinued operations during the first quarter of as those advances were used to fund operations of the leader 
at the completion of the sale of leader  million of those advances were prepaid and the remaining advances were maintained to fund operations of first federal 
in  interest expense declined by million  or  to million compared to million for the decline is due to a basis point drop in total interest bearing liabilities  to in from in deposit balances were up significantly in compared to million compared to million while costs were lower by basis points compared to 
fhlb advances included in continuing operations were higher in compared to million compared to million while other borrowings which were primarily securities sold under repurchase agreements in and borrowings from another bank in declined in compared to million compared to million 
as a result of the foregoing  first defiance s net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net interest margin from continuing operations calculated on a tax equivalent basis was for compared to in and in in addition to the factors cited above  net interest margin is also favorably impacted by an increase in non interest bearing deposits  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average of million in and million in provision for loan losses first defiance s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  the amount of assets graded by management as substandard  doubtful  or loss  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of first defiance s loan portfolio 
continued growth in the non residential loan and commercial loan portfolios at first defiance  which have an inherently higher level of risk than other types of loans  as well as ongoing concerns about economic conditions both nationally and within the northwest ohio market areas has caused the provision for loan losses to increase in from and levels 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  while the allowance for loan losses grew by from december  to december   the loan balances before the allowance increased by between those same periods 
total loan charge offs were  in compared to  and million in and respectively while recoveries in those same years were   and  respectively 
as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs were for the year ended december  compared to and for and respectively 
management does not believe there has been any deterioration in the overall quality of its loan portfolio during the percentage of the allowance for loan losses to total loans declined to at december  compared with at december  because the overall quality of the loan portfolio increased in and because in conjunction with the rfc acquisition  management recorded a discount of million to offset expected credit losses in the acquired portfolio 
given that discount  no allowance for loan losses was required for the million of loans remaining in that portfolio at december  as of december   management believes the remaining discount of million will be adequate to cover any future losses in that portfolio 
first defiance s non performing assets at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due and all real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
non performing assets at december  and by category were as follows december in thousands non performing loans single family residential non residential and multi family residential real estate   commercial consumer finance total non performing loans   real estate owned and repossessed assets total non performing assets   non performing loans in the single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent  and of the total loans in those categories respectively at december  compared to  and respectively for the same categories at december  non performing assets increased by approximately between december  and december  while loans increased by approximately between those same periods 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential losses from non performing assets 
non interest income non interest income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million in and million in of that increase  million is attributable to higher gains from sales of mortgage loans  which totaled million in compared to million in the higher level of gains is due to high mortgage origination volume through first federal s branch network during most of in response to historically low mortgage interest rates 
in first defiance originated a total of million of mortgage loans compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in gain on sale income is due not only to the increased volume  but also to more efficient management of the mortgage pipeline  which resulted in better pricing on the loans sold 
first defiance also realized million in securities gains during compared to just  of gains in as management took advantage of high bond prices resulting from the low interest rate environment and locked in gains in the portfolio 
also in  the company realized a full year of earnings on its investment in bank owned life insurance boli  which is included in non interest income 
boli earnings  which are exempt from income tax  totaled  compared to  recognized in following the october purchase of that product 
loan and deposit fees at first defiance increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
also  insurance and investment sales commissions recognized in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
in first defiance realized million in gains from mortgage loan sales  million in loan and deposit service fees and million from commission income 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million increase from to is attributable primarily to increases in compensation and benefits  which increased by million  to million for from million for amortization of mortgage servicing rights also increased significantly in  to million compared to million in those increases were offset by a recovery of previously recorded impairment of mortgage servicing rights of  in compared to an impairment charge of  in  a net change of more than million 
the increase in wages and benefits is attributable to added staff as a result of the acquisition of the three branches from rfc banking company in june  the addition of several commercial lenders beginning in mid and continuing through late  the addition of staff in the company s central operations departments in response to the increased workload resulting from a growing branch network and a growing loan portfolio  normal wage increases for existing staff which averaged between and  and a increase in the company s total group health insurance cost 
first defiance services a growing portfolio of mortgage loans for others  comprised of loans originated in its banking offices which are subsequently sold in the secondary market 
at december   first defiance serviced a total of  loans for others with a principal balance of million 
the total servicing portfolio at december  was  loans with balances of million 
the mortgage servicing rights associated with those loans had a net value of million as of december  after subtracting a  reserve for impairment  compared to million as of december  after subtracting million of impairment 
first defiance recognized a recovery of impairment reserves in totaling  compared to impairment expense of  in the impairment recovery in is the result of values increasing for mortgage servicing rights late in the year in response to increased mortgage loan rates 
those values dropped sharply in when mortgage rates initially fell 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights also increased significantly in  to million from million in  a direct result of the high volume of mortgage refinancing in the increase in non interest expense from to was primarily in compensation and benefits  which increased by million and in amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  which increased by  income taxes income taxes amounted to million in compared to million and million of income taxes from continuing operations in and respectively 
the effective tax rates for those years were  and respectively 
the tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate for the company because of investments in tax exempt securities and in boli 
the earnings on such investments are not subject to federal income tax 
discontinued operations first defiance s results included income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
the amount included million related to the after tax gain on the sale of the leader  million of income earned by leader during the three months the subsidiary was operated by first defiance  and  of other expenses associated with discontinued operations 
for the operating results of leader have been reported as discontinued operations 
for both and  interest expense recorded at first federal which was associated solely with financing activities of the leader  primarily interest on brokered cds and a portion of the company s fhlb advances  has been reported as part of discontinued operations 
total discontinued operations for were million or per share 
change in accounting for goodwill effective january   first defiance adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required under the standard  management evaluated goodwill recorded at its first insurance investments subsidiary for the purpose of measuring impairment and determined that such goodwill was impaired by   or per share after tax as of january  as required  that amount was reflected in the income statement as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of statement no 
 first defiance is no longer required to recognize goodwill amortization as an expense 
such amortization totaled  in management is required to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis to determine if the recorded value is impaired 
during  first defiance paid additional consideration of  to settle a contingent payout clause under an agreement entered into in when first insurance was acquired 
because the settlement was reached after january   the goodwill created by the settlement was deemed to be impaired in and was recorded as part of non interest expense in goodwill was evaluated at the end of and at the end of and no additional impairment charges were required 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio market area 
there are no industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with unused wholesale sources of funding and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
cash generated from operating activities was million in and cash used in operating activities was million and million in and respectively 
excluding the gain from the sale of discontinued operations and net changes in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  first defiance used million in and generated cash from operations of million in the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  the origination  amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
in a typical year  the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities 
in addition to the ordinary investing activities  in  first defiance completed the rfc acquisition  which increased cash from investing activities by million as deposits acquired exceeded the purchase price plus loans acquired 
in  first defiance realized proceeds from the sale of the leader of million 
in considering other investing activities  during million and million was realized from the maturity of investment securities and sale of investment securities respectively while million was used to fund loan growth and million was used to purchase available for sale securities 
during  a total of million was used to purchase available for sale securities  million in proceeds were received from the maturing of available for sale securities and million was used to fund loan growth 
in only million was invested in investment securities  million in proceeds were received from the maturing of available for sale securities and the reduction in the loan portfolio provided million in cash 
principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits  the utilization of fhlb advances  the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other banks 
in addition  first defiance also purchased common stock for its treasury 
for the year ended december   deposits declined by million  primarily do to the company not replacing million of maturing brokered certificates of deposit which were no longer needed 
first defiance also had a million decline in deposits in due to the maturing of million of brokered cds 
cash generated from increased deposit balances was million in also in  first defiance borrowed million from the fhlb under long term advance agreements and an additional million was borrowed on short term advances 
in  the company repaid million of existing advances from the fhlb  borrowed million of new advances from the fhlb and repaid million of borrowings from other banks 
also  the company repurchased million and million of common stock for treasury in and respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from first defiance s operating  investing and financing activities  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   first defiance had the following commitments to fund deposit  advance and borrowing obligations maturity dates by period at december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands savings  checking and demand accounts   certificates of deposit      fhlb overnight advances   fhlb fixed advances including interest      securities sold under repurchase agreements   lease obligations   total contractual cash obligations      includes principal payments of  and interest payments of  at december   first defiance had the following commitments to fund loan or line of credit obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total amounts less than after commitments committed year years years years in thousands mortgage loans in process   commercial loans in process   single family mortgage loan originations nonmortgage loan originations   consumer lines of credit      commercial lines of credit    total commitments      in addition to the above commitments  at december  first defiance had commitments to sell million of loans held for sale to freddie mac 
to meet its obligations  management can adjust the rate of savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments  it can sell or securitize mortgage and non mortgage loans  and it can turn to other sources of financing including fhlb advances  the federal reserve bank  bank lines and brokered certificates of deposit 
at december  first defiance had million capacity under its agreements with the fhlb and other banks

the decrease in the unrealized gains on available for sale securities decreased equity by million 
the vesting of management recognition plan shares and the release of esop shares increased equity by  and million respectively 
stock option exercises increased equity by approximately million

the book value of first defiance s common stock was per share at december  compared to per share at december  the tangible book value excluding goodwill and core deposit intangibles per share was and per share at december  and the decline in tangible book value in is the result of goodwill acquired as part of the rfc acquisition 
first defiance is subject to various capital requirements of the office of thrift supervision 
at december   first federal had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered well capitalized 
for additional information about first federal s capital requirements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pro forma income statement management does not believe that the reported income from continuing operations for the year ended december  accurately represented the true financial picture of first defiance because continuing operations for the first three months of and for all prior periods did not reflect the reinvestment of any of the net proceeds realized from the sale of the leader 
the following pro forma income statement attempts to present what first defiance s results from continuing operations would have been for had the sale of the leader occurred as of january  and the proceeds invested for the period from january  to april  management has estimated that additional assets added to the balance sheet as a result of the sale would have been reinvested to yield a weighted average rate of for the first quarter of also  to the extent possible  management has assumed that proceeds from the sale were used to prepay advances

income tax on  increase in net interest income at critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio region in which the company does business 
factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment  and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers and other matters than may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customer s who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the company s market area  and other factors in providing reserves against loan balances that have not been specifically classified 
while management believes its allowance for loan losses is conservatively determined based on the above factors  it does not believe the allowances to be excessive or unnecessary 
refer to the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a further description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuations of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note  statement of accounting policies  and note  mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s valuation process  methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses 
sfas deferral of fees first defiance believes that sfas no 
deferral of fees is a critical accounting policy that utilizes estimates in its preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance accounts for loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs by deferring the net fees  or net costs  and amortizing them as an adjustment of the related loan s yield 
while the amount of fees to be deferred is generally apparent in the origination of a loan  the amount of costs  especially indirect or allocated costs to defer is a judgment that management makes based various time studies and cost accounting assumptions 
refer to note  statement of accounting policies  for a description of first defiance s process and methodology 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by just over the base case scenario 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would decrease by only 
it should be noted that other areas of first defiance s income statement  such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income 
first defiance has increased its lending activities in the non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  first federal sells approximately of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table 
in prior years  the rate shock considered a basis point rate shock 
however with the low relative level of rates  as of december  a basis rate decline is not meaningful 
december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a increase in its economic value of equity 
if rates would fall by basis points its economic value of equity would decline by 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is generally negligible because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations and the durations are fairly closely matched 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
