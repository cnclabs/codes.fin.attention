item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  while the termination of the b 
braun clave agreement has had a short term adverse effect on us  we do not believe there will be any material adverse long term effects 
we believe many of b 
braun s customers prefer the clave to b 
braun s products and that many of them will continue to buy clave products through either abbott or our independent distributors when they are no longer available from b 
braun 
we have contracts to supply b 
braun a protected needle product  and b 
braun pays us under the safeline revenue sharing agreement 
we expect both of these revenue streams to continue to decrease as the market shifts to one piece  swabable  needleless technology 
independent domestic distributors we currently have approximately independent distributors in the united states and canada who employ approximately salespeople in the aggregate and which accounted for approximately of our net revenues in we include canada as domestic for administrative purposes 
distributors purchase and stock our products for resale to healthcare providers 
no single independent distributor accounts for as much as of net sales 
although the loss of one or more of our larger distributors could have an adverse affect on our business  we believe we could readily locate other distributors in the same territories who could continue to distribute our products to the same customers 
for several years before  our sales to independent distributors had been declining 
in  they showed a modest increase in sales after we took steps to provide better field support for independent distributors in order to increase our net sales to them 
in  sales to our independent distributors grew in total  and without the inclusion of sales originating with bio plexus 
while we believe that the declining trend in sales to the independent distributors has been reversed  and that sales to them will grow in  there is no assurance that continuing growth will be achieved  or that sales to them will not decline in the future 
international we distribute products in the principal countries in western europe  the pacific rim  latin america and in south africa 
foreign sales excluding canada accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in each of the years  and respectively 
the international division currently has approximately distributors 
we have three business development managers in europe  one each in new zealand and australia who together serve the entire pacific rim  southeast asia  the middle east  africa and south america 
we expect to add several more business development managers in administrative operations are in roncanova in northern italy at the site of our assembly plant and san clemente 
currently  we export from the united states substantially all the products sold internationally 
all sales from the united states are denominated in us dollars and sales from italy are denominated in euros 
we believe it will be necessary for us to establish production facilities in a number of locations outside north america to meet local demands and avoid high transportation costs 
manufacturing manufacturing of our products involves injection molding of plastic and silicone parts  manual and automated assembly of the molded plastic parts  needles and other components  quality control inspection  packaging and sterilization 
we mold all of our proprietary components  and perform all assembly  quality control  inspection  packaging  labeling and shipping of our products 
our manufacturing operations function as a separate group  producing products for the marketing and sales groups 
we own a fully integrated medical device manufacturing facility in two adjacent buildings totaling  square feet in san clemente  california 
a mold maintenance shop supports the repair and maintenance needs of our molding operation and manufactures some of our production molds 
in addition  the mold maintenance shop serves as a research and development prototype shop  and utilizes advanced computer assisted design systems and automated machining equipment 
the state of the art medical device molding facility includes a  square foot class  clean room in which all molding and automated assembly of our proprietary medical components is performed 
the clean room is equipped with injection molding machines and ancillary equipment including robots designed to minimize human intervention  and sophisticated  highly automated assembly systems to assemble the clave  clave integrated y site  microclave  clave vial access spike  clc  o valve  rf and the mcgaw protected needle products 
the assembly systems are custom designed and manufactured for us 
we assemble our punctur guard products in our  square foot manufacturing facility in vernon  connecticut near hartford  which includes two clean rooms 
the assembly processes for both the bcn and the winged set use custom made automated assembly systems 
molding of punctur guard components  which had been done by outside custom molding companies  will all be transfered in our san clemente facility by the end of the second quarter of most of our manual assembly is done at our facilities in ensenada  baja california  mexico 
those facilities include approximately  square feet of production and warehousing space and an electron beam sterilizer 
principal products assembled manually are iv therapy systems  the lopez valve  and clave ancillary products and accessories 
we also assemble iv therapy systems in our approximately  square foot leased facility in northern italy that we acquired in june our state of the art injection molding technology and highly automated assembly systems are designed to maintain a high level of product quality and achieve high volume production at low unit manufacturing costs 
to achieve these advantages and to gain greater control over raw material and finished product delivery times  we mold our entire requirements of proprietary molded components 
the raw materials for our molding operation are principally resins and silicones  and these materials are available from several sources 
generic  off the shelf items are purchased from outside vendors unless significant cost savings can be achieved by molding in house 
we are not dependent on any individual vendor for purchased parts and have no contracts with our suppliers beyond the terms of purchase orders issued 
our products are sterilized in processes which use either gamma or electron beam e beam radiation 
most of the sterilization is by e beam  which is less expensive and quicker than gamma radiation sterilization 
while all sterilization was performed by independent companies through the end of  we commenced limited operation of our own sterilization facility at our plant in mexico in february and we will sterilize all of our products that are assembled in mexico at that facility 
we will continue to use independent contractors to sterilize products assembled in san clemente and italy 
we have an ongoing program to increase systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiency  reduce labor costs  reduce time needed to produce an order  and minimize investment in inventory 
in the third quarter of we commenced use of automated assembly equipment for the o valve and commenced use of automated assembly equipment for the clc in the fourth quarter of throughout and through mid we added molding and automated assembly capacity for clave production 
in the third quarter of we commenced a significant expansion of our manual assembly capacity in mexico  clean room and warehouse space was completed in june  and we completed construction and installation and limited production start up of an electron beam sterilizer in the first quarter of in late and early  we commenced moving plastic injection molding done for our connecticut division formerly bio plexus to our san clemente facility  which is scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter of  the purpose of the move is to ensure more consistent quality in our molded components and decrease costs 
ongoing steps also include automation of the production of new products and other products for which volume is growing 
we have been considering establishment of production facilities outside north america for some time  and in june we acquired a manufacturer of iv sets in italy 
we continue to consider establishment of production facilities in other areas 
because significant innovation is required to achieve these goals  there is no assurance that these steps will achieve the desired results 
further  our connecticut and  more recently  our italian facilities are transitioning to our manufacturing methods  but there is no assurance as to the completion or success of those transitions 
government regulation government regulation is a significant factor in the development  marketing and manufacturing of our products 
the fda regulates medical product manufacturers and their products under a number of statutes including the fdc act  and we and our products are subject to the regulations of the fda 
the fdc act provides two basic review procedures for medical devices 
certain products may qualify for a submission authorized by section k of the fdc act  under which the manufacturer gives the fda a pre market notification of the manufacturer s intention to commence marketing the product 
the manufacturer must  among other things  establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a letter finding substantial equivalence 
if a medical device does not qualify for the section k procedure  the manufacturer must file a pre market approval pma application 
this requires substantially more extensive pre filing testing than the section k procedure and involves a significantly longer fda review process 
fda approval of a pma application occurs only after the applicant has established safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda 
each of our current products has qualified  and we anticipate that any new products that we are likely to market will qualify  for the expedited section k clearance procedure 
there is no assurance  however  that new products that we develop or any manufacturers that we might acquire  or claims that we may make concerning those products  will qualify for expedited clearance rather than the more time consuming pma procedure or that  in any case  they will receive clearance from the fda 
fda regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive 
uncertainties as to time required to obtain fda clearances or approvals could adversely affect the timing and expense of new product introductions 
all of the regulated products that we currently manufacture are classified as class ii medical devices by the fda 
class ii medical devices are subject to performance standards relating to one or more aspects of the design  manufacturing  testing and performance or other characteristics of the product in addition to general controls involving compliance with labeling and record keeping requirements 
we must comply with fda regulations governing medical device manufacturing practices 
the fda and the california department of health services dhs require manufacturers to register and subject manufacturers to periodic fda and dhs inspections of their manufacturing facilities 
we are an fda registered medical device manufacturer  and must demonstrate that we and our contract manufacturers comply with the fda s current quality system regulations qsr 
under these regulations  the manufacturing process must be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures and the ability to produce devices that meet the manufacturer s specifications must be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every critical aspect of the process 
they also require investigation of any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced and detailed record keeping 
further  the fda s interpretation and enforcement of these requirements has been increasingly strict in recent years and seems likely to be even more stringent in the future 
failure to adhere to qsrs would cause the products produced to be considered in violation of the applicable law and subject to enforcement action 
the fda monitors compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the fda  and by subjecting them to periodic fda inspections of manufacturing facilities 
if an fda inspector observes conditions that might be violative  the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily  or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace 
we believe that our products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable fda and dhs regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will be cleared by the fda and classified as class ii products  or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the fda or dhs 
in addition  changes in fda  dhs or other federal or state health  environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect our business 
to market our products in the european community ec  we must conform to additional requirements of the ec and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives 
as a manufacturer that designs  manufactures and markets its own devices  we must comply with the quality management standards of en iso en 
those quality standards are similar to the qsr regulations but incorporate the quality requirements for product design and development 
manufacturers of medical devices must also conform to ec directives such as council directive eec medical device directive and their applicable annexes 
those regulations assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the ec 
once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the medical device directive  the ce mark may be affixed to its devices 
the ce mark gives devices an unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the ec 
we have demonstrated conformity to the regulations of both iso en  iso and the medical device directive and we affix the ce mark to our device labeling for product sold in member countries of the ec 
we believe our products and systems are in compliance with all ec requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will conform or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the ec 
competition the market for iv products is intensely competitive 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our continued product innovation  the quality  convenience and reliability of our products  access to distribution channels  patent protection  and pricing 
we encounter significant competition in this market both from large established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies 
our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to differentiate our products based on safety features  product quality  cost effectiveness  ease of use and convenience  as well as our ability to perceive and respond to changing customer needs 
in the long term  we expect that our ability to compete will continue to be affected by our ability to reduce unit manufacturing costs through higher volume production 
in addition to competing with conventional needle iv connection systems and protected needle connection systems marketed by companies such as baxter healthcare corporation baxter and abbott  our present and future products will compete with needleless iv connection systems like those marketed by baxter  becton dickinson and company bd  b 
braun  alaris corporation and others 
although we believe that our needleless clave has distinct advantages over competing systems  there is no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully with these products 
the blood collection needle market is highly competitive  and a large segment of the market continues to use non safety devices that are generally less expensive than safety devices such as the punctur guard products 
the largest share of the blood collection needle market is held by bd 
manufacturers of products with which we currently compete  or might compete in the future  include large companies with an established presence in the healthcare products market and substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution  managerial and other resources 
in particular  baxter  abbott and b 
braun are leading distributors of iv therapy systems  while bd dominates the blood collection needle market 
several of these competitors have broad product lines and have been successful in obtaining full line contracts with a significant number of hospitals to supply substantially all of their iv product requirements 
in order to penetrate more of these hospitals  we have established a strategic supply and distribution relationship with abbott 
we believe the success of the clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors  which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
we are aware of a number of such products 
we believe most of those products were developed primarily by companies who currently do not have the distribution or financial capabilities that we have  although some of those products may be distributed in the future by larger companies that do have such capabilities 
we believe these products have had a modest impact on our clave business to date  but there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with these or future products developed by others 
we believe that our ability to compete in the custom iv systems market depends upon the same factors affecting our existing products  but will be particularly affected by cost to the customer and delivery times 
while we believe we have advantages in these two areas  there is no assurance that other companies will not be able to compete successfully with our custom iv systems 
patents we have united states and certain foreign patents on the clave  clc  punctur guard technology  click lock  and piggy lock iv connectors and have united states patents on the lopez valve connector 
we have applications pending for additional united states and foreign patents on the o valve  clc  clave  punctur guard  click lock and piggy lock iv connectors 
the expiration dates of our patents range from to while we no longer manufacture and sell the click lock and piggy lock  the patents have considerable value for potential use in other devices 
our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
while we have obtained certain patents and applied for additional united states and foreign patents covering certain of our products  there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will prevent competitors from introducing similar devices or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
we also believe that patents on the click lock and the lopez valve products may have been  and that patent protection on the clave may be  important in preventing others from introducing competing products that are as effective as our products 
the loss of patent protection on clave  clc  punctur guard  click lock or lopez valve products could adversely affect our ability to exclude other manufacturers from producing effective competitive products and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
the fact that a patent is issued to us does not eliminate the possibility that patents owned by others may contain claims that are infringed by our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which would result in substantial cost to us and in diversion of our resources  may be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in such litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we have initiated litigation  and will continue to initiate litigation in the future  to enforce our intellectual property rights against those we believe to be infringing on our patents 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources

item legal proceedings 
in an action filed august  entitled icu medical  inc 
v 
b braun medical  inc 
pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california  we allege that b 
braun infringes icu s patent by the manufacture and sale of its ultrasite medical connector 
on december   we were awarded an additional patent and on december  we filed an additional action against b 
braun for patent infringement and moved to amend the action to include that allegation 
the action has since been amended to include our claim of infringement of the additional patent 
we seek monetary damages and injunctive relief and intend to vigorously pursue this matter 
the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time 
we are from time to time involved in various other legal proceedings  either as a defendant or plaintiff  most of which are routine litigation in the normal course of business

we are a leader in the development  manufacture and sale of proprietary  disposable medical connection systems for use in intravenous iv therapy applications 
our devices are designed to protect healthcare workers and their patients from exposure to infectious diseases such as hepatitis b and c and human immunodeficiency virus hiv through accidental needlesticks 
we are also a leader in the production of custom iv systems and low cost generic iv systems and we incorporate our proprietary products on many of those custom iv systems 
we also manufacture and sell the punctur guard line of blood collection needles  which we acquired in october critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and our critical accounting policies are summarized below 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the expected amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
investment securities are all marketable and considered available for sale 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our current investment policies  the securities in which we invest have no significant difference between cost and fair value 
if our investment policies were to change  and there were differences between cost and fair value  that difference  net of tax effect  would be reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we record sales and related costs when ownership of the product transfers to the customer 
under the terms of most purchase orders  ownership transfers on shipment  but in some cases it transfers on delivery 
if there are significant doubts at the time of shipment as to the collectibility of the receivable  we defer recognition of the sale in revenue until the receivable is collected 
most of our customers are medical product manufacturers or distributors  although some are end users 
our only post sale obligations are warranty and certain rebates 
we warrant products against defects and have a policy permitting the return of defective products 
we provide a reserve for warranty returns as an expense  amounts have been insignificant 
customers  with certain exceptions  do not retain any right of return and there is no price protection with respect to unsold products  returns from customers with return rights have not been significant 
we accrue rebates as a reduction in revenue based on contractual commitments and historical experience 
adjustments of estimates of warranty claims  rebates or returns  which have not been  and are not expected to be material  affect current operating results when they are determined 
accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value 
an allowance is provided for estimated collection losses based on specific past due accounts for which we consider collection to be doubtful 
loss exposure is principally with international distributors for whom normal payment terms are long in comparison to those of our other customers and  to a lesser extent  domestic distributors 
many of these distributors are relatively small and we are vulnerable to adverse developments in their businesses that can hinder our collection of amounts due 
if actual collection losses exceed expectations  we could be required to accrue additional bad debt expense  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the accrual occurs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we need to carry many components to accommodate our rapid product delivery  and if we misestimate demand or if customer requirements change  we may have components in inventory that we may not be able to use 
most finished products are made only after we receive orders  but for those that are not  we need to estimate what may not be saleable 
we regularly review inventory for slow moving items and write off all items we do not expect to use in manufacturing  or finished products we do not expect to sell 
if actual usage of components or sales of finished goods inventory is less than our estimates  we would be required to write off additional inventory  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the write off occurs 
property and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
the estimates of useful lives are significant judgments in accounting for property and equipment  particularly for molds and automated assembly machines that are custom made for us 
we may retire them on an accelerated basis if we replace them with larger or more technologically advanced tooling 
the remaining useful lives of all property and equipment are reviewed regularly and lives are adjusted or assets written off based on current estimates of future use 
as part of that review  property and equipment is reviewed for other indicators of impairment  but to date we have not encountered circumstances indicating the carrying amount of an asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
an unexpected shortening of useful lives of property and equipment that significantly increases depreciation provisions  or other circumstances causing us to record an impairment loss on such assets  could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the related charges are recorded 
new accounting pronouncements we have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business overview until the late s  our primary emphasis in product development  sales and marketing was disposable medical connectors for use in iv therapy  and our principal product was the clave 
in the late s  we commenced a transition from a product centered company to an innovative  fast  efficient  low cost manufacturer of custom iv systems  using processes that we believe can be readily applied to a variety of disposable medical devices 
this strategy enables us to capture revenue on the entire iv system  and not just a component of the system 
we are also increasing our efforts to acquire new products 
we acquired the punctur guard line of blood collection needles in and are continuing to seek other opportunities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding acquisition opportunities  or in acquiring companies or products 
custom iv systems and new products will be of increasing importance to us in future years 
we expect clave products to continue to grow in the us  but at a slower percentage growth rate than in the past because of our large market penetration 
growth of all our products outside the us could be substantial  although to date it has been modest 
therefore  we will be directing increasing product development  acquisition  sales and marketing efforts to custom iv systems and new products in the iv and increasing our emphasis on the markets outside the us our relationship with abbott has been and will continue to be of singular importance to our growth 
in  approximately of our revenue was from sales to abbott  and we expect this percentage to increase in the future 
abbott has a significant share of the iv set market in the iv  and provides us access to that market 
we expect that abbott will be important to our growth for clave  custom iv systems  and our other products in the iv and also outside the us we believe that achievement of our growth objectives  both within the us  and outside the us  will require increased efforts by us in sales and marketing and product development  and we expect to increase expenditures for those starting in there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy 
the custom iv systems market is still small and we could encounter customer resistance to custom products 
further  we could encounter increased competition as other companies see opportunity 
product development or acquisition efforts may not succeed  and even if we do develop or acquire products  there is no assurance that we will achieve profitable sales of such products 
an adverse change in our relationship with abbott  or a deterioration of abbott s position in the market  could have an adverse effect on us 
increased expenditures for sales and marketing and product acquisition and development may not yield desired results when expected  or at all 
while we have taken steps to control all these risks  there are certain of those risks which may be outside of our control  and there is no assurance that steps we have taken will succeed 
overview of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net revenues by product as a percentage of total net revenues product line clave custom and generic iv systems punctur guard clc other products license  royalty and revenue share total most custom iv systems include one or more claves 
total clave sales including custom iv systems with at least one clave were of net revenue in and of net revenue in we sell our products to independent distributors and through agreements with abbott the abbott agreements and certain other medical product manufacturers 
most independent distributors handle the full line of our products 
abbott purchases clave products  principally bulk  non sterile connectors  and the clc in addition  we sell custom iv systems to abbott under a program referred to as setsource 
in january  we announced the execution of amendments to our existing agreements with abbott 
the amendments extend the terms of our agreements to and provide abbott with rights to distribute all existing icu medical products worldwide 
we signed another contract amendment with abbott in january to distribute our punctur guard line of blood collection needles in the us and the rest of the world 
we also sell certain other products to a number of other medical product manufacturers 
in august  abbott announced that it will spin off its core hospital products division to its stockholders as an independent company 
the hospital products business  which will become hospira  inc  accounts for virtually all of our sales to abbott 
we believe the spin off is a positive development for us and will result in new business opportunities with the new hospira 
we believe that as healthcare providers continue to either consolidate or join major buying organizations  our success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on our ability  either independently or through strategic relationships such as our abbott relationship  to secure long term clave contracts with large healthcare providers and major buying organizations 
as a result of this marketing and distribution strategy we derive most of our revenues from a relatively small number of distributors and manufacturers 
the loss of a strategic relationship with a customer or a decline in demand for a manufacturing customer s products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we believe the success of the clave has motivated  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece  swabbable  needleless connectors that may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
we are aware of a number of such products 
in response to competitive pressure  we have been reducing prices to protect and expand our market  although overall pricing has been stable recently 
the price reductions to date have been more than offset by increased volume 
we expect that the average price of our clave products may continue to decline 
there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
the federal needlestick safety and prevention act  enacted in november  modified standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration to require employers to use safety iv systems where appropriate to reduce risk of injury to employees from needlesticks 
we believe this law has had and will continue to have a positive effect on sales of our needleless systems  although we are unable to quantify the current or anticipated effect of the law on our sales 
we are taking steps to reduce our dependence on our current proprietary products 
we are seeking to substantially expand our custom iv systems business through increased sales to medical product manufacturers and independent distributors 
under one of our abbott agreements  we manufacture all new custom iv sets for sale by abbott and jointly promote the products under the name setsource 
we expect continuing significant increases in sales of custom iv systems under this agreement 
we also contract with group purchasing organizations and independent dealer networks for inclusion of our products among those available to members of those entities 
custom iv systems accounted for approximately million of net sales in  including net sales under the abbott setsource program of approximately million 
there is no assurance that either one of these initiatives will continue to succeed 
in the fourth quarter of we acquired bio plexus 
inc for approximately million before expenses  net of cash acquired  and bio plexus has been included in our consolidated financial statements since october  bio plexus s principal products are blood collection needles  under the punctur guard name  that are designed to eliminate exposure to sharp  contaminated needles 
bio plexus s revenues in  including royalties  were million  and its effect on net income was immaterial 
we have an ongoing program to increase systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiency  reduce labor costs  reduce time needed to produce an order  and minimize investment in inventory 
these include use of automated assembly equipment for new products and other products for which volume is growing  use of larger molds and molding machines  centralization of all proprietary molding in san clemente  expansion of our production facility in mexico  and the establishment of other production facilities outside the us we distribute products through three distribution channels 
net product revenues for each distribution channel were as follows channel medical product manufacturers independent domestic distributors international total quarterly results the healthcare business in the united states is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and activity tends to diminish somewhat in the summer months of june  july and august  when illness is less frequent than in winter months and patients tend to postpone elective procedures 
this typically causes seasonal fluctuations in our business 
in addition  we can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers  which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels  and less by seasonality 
our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales  which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue 
year to year comparisons we present summarized income statement data in item selected financial data 
the following table shows  for the three most recent years  the percentages of each income statement caption in relation to revenues  and the percentage change in each caption in each year 
we currently calculate our gross profit percentage based on net sales  which includes only product sales and excludes non product revenue such as license fees 
see below for more information on non product revenue 
we present the alternative calculation based on total revenue for the convenience of readers who prefer to view it that way 
percentage of revenues changes v

revenue net sales other total revenues cost of sales gross profit percentage of net sales percentage of all revenues selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses total operating expenses income from operations investment income income before income taxes income taxes net income as further explained below  our growth in net income of in was less than our revenue growth of  principally because our gross margin decreased and the decrease was only partially offset by a reduction of operating expenses and income taxes as a percentage or revenues 
comparison of to in we had total revenues of  which was  or  higher than the total revenues of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of custom iv systems  which increased  punctur guard  which increased by  and clave products  which increased by  distribution channels net sales to abbott were  in  compared to  in  an increase of 
clave sales to abbott increased to  from  principally because of an increase in unit volume as the clave product penetration of abbott customer accounts increased 
sales of custom iv systems to abbott under the setsource program approximated  for the year  up from  in principally because of an increase in the number of units sold 
we expect a continued increase in clave unit and dollar sales volume with abbott  as well as a significant increase in setsource unit and dollar sales volume in net sales of the clc to abbott increased to approximately  from  in and we expect sales of the clc to abbott will continue to increase in the future 
net sales of rhino decreased to  for sales of rhino started to decline in early  and they are expected to continue to decline in the future as the market shifts to swabbable technology 
there is no assurance as to the amount of any of the future sales increases to abbott 
in connection with the november settlement of our contract litigation against b 
braun  we terminated the manufacture and supply agreement under which we sold clave products to b 
braun effective december  we sold virtually no clave products to b 
braun in as compared with  in  and will not sell clave product sales to b 
braun in the future 
revenue derived from b 
braun was  in compared to  in the termination of the clave agreement has had a short term adverse effect on us because b 
braun has been filling customer orders from its inventory of clave products  with the result that some former b 
braun customers may not order from alternative clave distribution channels until b 
braun s clave inventory is exhausted 
we do not believe the termination of the b 
braun agreement will have any material long term adverse effect on us 
we have lost some sales unit volume to b 
braun products that compete with clave  but we believe many of b 
braun s customers prefer the clave to b 
braun s products and will continue to buy clave products from alternative distribution channels  which are either abbott or our independent distributors 
we estimate  based on information from distribution channels  that b 
braun customers that accounted for approximately of the unit volume of clave products formerly sold by b 
braun were purchasing clave products from alternative distribution channels by december  we believe that the unit volume to former b 
braun clave customers through other clave distribution channels will increase when clave products are no longer available from b 
braun 
to the extent that customers needs are filled through independent distributors  we generate higher revenue and profit per clave connector  because independent distributors purchase packaged sterilized products  often complete iv sets  from us at higher prices than the bulk nonsterile clave sites which accounted for most of the claves that we sold to b 
braun 
we have contracts to supply b 
braun a protected needle product  and b 
braun pays us under the safeline revenue sharing agreement 
we expect both of these revenue streams to continue to decrease as the market shifts to one piece  swabbable  needleless technology 
net sales to independent domestic distributors including canada increased approximately to  in from  in the increase was due principally to the inclusion of  of punctur guard product sales which included months of revenue compared to  in  which included revenue only for the last two months of the year following our acquisition of bio plexus on october  also contributing to this increase is a increase in custom iv systems  and a increase in clave product sales  both principally due to an increase in unit volume 
we believe this increase in sales of clave and custom iv systems with claves is because of acquisition by our independent distributors of market share from b 
braun and we expect a continued increase in unit sales of clave and custom iv systems with claves to independent distributors 
there is no assurance as to the amount of any future sales increases to the independent domestic distributors 
net sales to international distributors excluding canada were  in  as compared with  in the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in clave product sales as distributors slowed their orders to reduce their inventory levels 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in custom iv system product sales and punctur guard product sales 
we expect increases in foreign sales in the future in response to increased sales and marketing efforts including additional business development managers 
also  we believe we will see a positive impact beginning late in or from our recently announced abbott contract amendments with rights to distribute all icu medical products and punctur guard products outside the united states 
there is no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
product and other revenue total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to  in from  in total net sales of clave products including custom iv systems with clave increased from  in to  in  or 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in unit shipments of clave products to abbott and our domestic distributors  offset by a decrease in unit shipments to our international distributors and the absence of shipments to b 
braun 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in changed little from and while we expect some decrease in  we expect the decreases to be minimal 
we expect continued growth in clave unit and dollar sales volume in  notwithstanding the termination of distribution through b 
braun  because of the growth that we expect in our other distribution channels 
however  there is no assurance that the expectations will be realized 
in october  we commenced production of the microclave 
it is smaller than the existing clave but is functionally similar 
we market it as an extension of the clave product line for use where its smaller size is advantageous  such as pediatric care 
sales are included in clave product sales 
net sales of custom and generic iv systems  which included custom iv sets  both with a clave and without a clave  were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the setsource program with abbott accounted for approximately of the increase  with most of the balance in sales to independent domestic and international distributors 
we acquired the punctur guard product line and technology with the purchase of bio plexus on october  we now produce the punctur guard line of products and also license the technology to two medical device manufacturers for use in catheters 
after our acquisition of bio plexus on october   we made significant improvements to the punctur guard products and manufacturing processes 
we did not actively promote sales of those products until completion of those product improvements 
we completed improvements on the winged set products and re launched them on march  we completed improvements on the bcn and started selling the improved product in late september sales of punctur guard products excluding royalties were  in compared to  for the last two months of we expect sales of these products to increase in the future  but we give no assurance that such increases will be achieved 
net sales of the clc grew slightly from  in to  in  an increase of 
sales to abbott and domestic distributors accounted for all the growth offset by a decrease in sales to foreign distributors 
we expect sales of the clc to increase in and later years through all of our distribution channels  but there is no assurance as to the amount or timing of future clc sales 
other products consist principally of the lopez valve and protected needle products 
increases in lopez valve sales in were offset by decreases in protected needle sales as the safe connector market continues its shift to needleless technology 
other revenue consists of license  royalty and revenue share income  and has been presented separately in our financial statements since the fourth quarter of  amounts were not significant prior to this 
the principal component was ongoing royalties received for other companies use of punctur guard technology of  safeline revenue share payments from b 
braun of approximately  and one time license fees of  we expect to receive ongoing royalties for the use of punctur guard technology and safeline revenue share payments from b 
braun as well as additional payments under another license of approximately  per quarter for four years starting in the first quarter of we may receive other license fees or royalties in the future for the use of our technology 
we give no assurance as to amounts or timing of any future payments  or whether such payments will be received 
we expect revenue growth in to be lower than it was in the percentage growth in our clave business including custom i 
v 
systems in is expected to be lower than in  although similar in dollar amount 
we expect significant growth in custom iv systems and in the punctur guard product line and modest growth in our international markets 
we do expect significant new revenues under the amendments to the abbott contracts signed in january  but we cannot  at this time  estimate how quickly such revenues will be achieved or whether they will have any significant effect on results 
we do expect to have a greater percentage of revenue growth in than our current expectations for however  there can be no assurance that our expectations for and will be achieved 
gross margin for  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  was as compared to in we believe approximately half of this difference is due to several temporary factors  the principal one relating to improvements in our automated production in san clemente during the third quarter which resulted in a period of unabsorbed overhead 
the other half relates principally to gross margins in our punctur guard products being lower than most of our other products 
in the fourth quarter of gross margin had improved to 
we expect margins on the punctur guard products to improve over the next year as we continue to improve sales and fully convert this product line to our manufacturing techniques 
we anticipate that improvements in the punctur guard margin and improvements in our automated production in san clemente will result in a modest increase in the gross margin in  but we do not expect it to be as high as it was in we give no assurance as to the amount or timing of future improvements to our gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in  excluding research and development expenses  increased to  and was approximately of revenue in as compared with  or of revenue in a portion of the increase was because of the inclusion of bio plexus and a small increase in sales and marketing costs related to increased sales 
administrative costs were higher because of personnel additions and increased information technology expenses  but those higher costs were offset by decreased litigation expenses 
we expect sg a costs to increase in because of growth in the company  and addition of new sales personnel and additional sales and marketing expenses in order to support sales growth  including support of the expanding business with abbott 
research and development expenses r d in increased to  and was of revenue in as compared to in spending was principally on new product development  product improvements to punctur guard  and software development to support manufacturing and distribution of custom and generic iv systems 
we estimate that r d costs will increase in to support on going new product development and various product and process improvements 
however  r d costs could differ from these estimates and the r d may not be completed as expected 
income from operations increased  or and was of revenues as compared to in the decline in income from operations as a percentage of revenue was because of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the effect of that decrease was partially offset by the level of operating expenses  which increased only while net revenue increased 
investment income decreased in as compared with  principally because of a decrease in the investment portfolio and declines in interest rates slightly offset by higher interest rates through our finance loans receivable 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in was  a decrease from in principally because of savings in state income taxes 
we expect a slight increase in the effective tax rate in net income in increased 
while revenues increased  gross margin decreased from to 
that decrease caused the amount of gross profit to increase only 
operating expenses increased slightly more than that   causing income from operations to increase only 
the drop in investment income caused the increase in revenue before income taxes to be only  and this was partially offset by a savings in income taxes  leaving the overall increase at 
net income per share diluted increased or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was more than that of net income because there were fewer shares outstanding due to our stock repurchase of common shares and there were fewer dilutive shares as a result of the lower average market price of our common stock 
comparison of to in  we had total revenues of  which was  or  higher than the total revenues of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of clave products  which increased by  and custom iv systems  which increased net sales to abbott were  in  compared to  in clave sales to abbott increased to  from  principally because of an increase in unit volume as the clave product penetration of abbott customer accounts increased 
sales of custom iv systems to abbott under the setsource program approximated  for the year  up from  in  the year the program was initiated 
net sales of the clc to abbott almost tripled to approximately million from the low levels of when abbott was balancing its inventory position 
net sales of rhino were virtually unchanged  at just below million for revenue from b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in the decrease was principally because of a decrease in sales of clave products from  to  on lower unit volume 
clave product sales to b 
braun in the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately of b 
braun s annual clave volume  as b 
braun made its final purchases under the agreement to purchase clave products 
most of the balance of the decrease in net revenue from b 
braun was in sales of the mcgaw protected needle 
safeline revenue sharing payments decreased slightly from last year 
net sales to independent domestic distributors increased approximately to  in from  in these sales include  of punctur guard sales after we acquired bio plexus on october  the increase was due principally to an increase in custom iv systems  the inclusion of punctur guard sales for two months  and a increase in clave product sales 
the increase in sales of custom iv systems was attributable to an increase in unit volume 
the increase in clave product sales was also because of higher unit volume 
we believe the increase in sales of clave products to independent distributors was principally because of acquisition of market share from b 
braun 
total sales to international distributors excluding canada were  in  as compared with  in we have distribution arrangements in the principal countries in western europe  the pacific rim and latin america and in south africa 
total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to  in from  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over abbott accounted for of the growth in dollar sales of clave  international approximately  partially offset by the decline in sales to b 
braun 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in was virtually the same as in net sales of custom iv systems were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the setsource program with abbott accounted for about of the increase  with most of the balance in sales to independent domestic distributors 
net sales of the clc grew from  in to  an increase of 
abbott accounted for approximately of the increase  with the balance among domestic and international distributors 
other products consist principally of the lopez valve and protected needle products 
net sales of the lopez valve increased in to  on higher unit volume to domestic and international distributors 
net sales of protected needle products decreased  principally because of a decrease in sales of the mcgaw protected needle 
sales of click lock and piggy lock products were the same in both years at approximately  we discontinued sales of click lock and piggy lock products in the first quarter of  and sales of the other protected needle products decreased in as the safe connector market continues its shift to needleless technology 
other revenue consisted primarily of a payment for a fully paid up license to use certain of our patents of million received in december  royalties received for other companies use of punctur guard technology of  and safeline revenue share fourth quarter only of approximately million 
gross margin for  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  declined from in to in because of significant unabsorbed overhead in the fourth quarter of this occurred because of three weeks of substantially reduced production in mexico as a result of difficulty in processing orders and preparing production orders at the time we implemented our new enterprise software  and because of a planned two week shutdown of the automated production facility in san clemente for preventive maintenance in december 
until the fourth quarter  gross margins had been at selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in sg a costs were of net revenue in compared to in sales and marketing costs increased approximately million  but decreased as a percentage of sales from to 
increases were principally in salaries and related costs and travel 
general and administrative costs increased approximately million  and were approximately of net revenue in both years 
increases were principally in salary and benefits 
research and development r d costs increased in by  to  and were approximately of net revenue in both and the principal increase in spending was on product development for the punctur guard product line to make product improvements that we felt were necessary to successfully market and sell the products 
spending on new product development also increased from the operating margin increased to in  compared to in  principally because operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income decreased by  in  notwithstanding an increase in the investment portfolio  because of the effect of continuing declines in interest rates since the beginning of our effective income tax rate in was  up from in principally because state tax credits were lower in than in and tax exempt investment income declined as a percentage of taxable income 
net income in increased from principally because the gross profit increased  but operating expenses increased only 
this resulted in a increase in operating margin that was partially offset by the decline in investment income and the increase in the effective income tax rate 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income because there were more shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources during  our working capital increased slightly by  to  from  the increase was due to working capital generated by operations which was virtually offset by the purchases of treasury stock  investment in property and equipment  acquisitions and new finance loans 
our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities position decreased in by  to  from  at december  this is because the purchase of  of treasury stock  purchases of property and equipment of  net advances of  made under finance loans and cash payment of  for acquisitions exceeded the aggregate of cash provided by operating activities excluding the tax benefits from exercise of stock options of  and cash provided by the company s employee equity plans of  during  our working capital increased approximately  to  from  our cash and cash equivalents and liquid investment securities increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities excluding tax benefits from exercise of stock options and  from exercise of stock options including tax benefits  partially offset by  used to purchase property and equipment and  used to acquire bio plexus net of cash acquired 
investing activities capital expenditures continued at a relatively high rate in principally because of our expansion in mexico  including an electron beam sterilizer  and investment in molds  molding equipment  automated assembly equipment  computers and software 
capital expenditures increased in principally for investment in molding machines  molds and automated assembly machines  as well as recurring facilities improvements and acquisition of computer equipment and software 
we also replaced our enterprise software with oracle corporation s ri business suite in upon completing an evaluation of the design and capacity of our manufacturing facilities  we estimate that our current facilities will be adequate through  but that production after may require additional clean room facilities for molding and automated assembly 
we expect to decide in the future how to meet the need for any additional facilities and the location of additional clean room facilities for molding and automated assembly 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million and will be paid from cash we generate from operations 
we expect the million will be spent on molds  molding equipment and automated assembly equipment  computers and software to maintain current capacity including targeted growth for of those amounts  approximately million was committed under contracts at december   and we expect to commit the balance in amounts of spending are estimates and actual spending may substantially differ from those amounts 
in june we acquired the assets of two affiliated manufacturers of iv systems located in northern italy for a cash payment of approximately million 
principal assets acquired are assembly facilities and related equipment and inventories and intangible assets 
the acquired assets and related operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements since june  their effect on our financial statements is immaterial 
we may acquire other businesses or product lines in the future 
icu finance  inc is a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary that we established in as a licensed commercial lender to provide financing to companies involved in distribution of healthcare products and provision of healthcare services 
loans are made only to credit worthy healthcare entites and are fully secured by real and personal property 
at december   it had  in loans outstanding 
scheduled maturities are     and  weighted average maturity principal and interest at december  was years and the weighted average interest rate was 
in october  we discontinued new lending activities 
we will honor unfunded lending commitments on existing credit facilities  which totaled approximately  at december  financing activities in we purchased  shares of our common stock for  until those purchases  we had not purchased treasury stock since october  except for a small amount in march we may purchase additional shares in the future 
however  future purchases  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
cash provided by stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  including tax benefits  was  in as compared with  in  options were exercised on  shares in as compared with  shares in operating activities our cash provided by operating activities tends to increase over time because of increases in our net income 
however  it is subject to fluctuations  principally from changes in accounts receivable  inventories  current liabilities and tax benefits from exercise of stock options 
normally the substantial majority of our accounts receivable are current or no more than thirty days past due 
in recent years  the majority of each quarter s sales have been in that last half of the quarter with the result that the amount of accounts receivable reported as of the end of each quarter tend to be higher than the amounts at other times during a quarter 
accounts receivable increased from  at december  to  at december   or  the increase was because of a increase in fourth quarter revenue from year to year  and because shipments in the fourth quarter of were generally made later in the quarter than in we generally try to maintain a minimal amount of inventory of finished goods and work in process  but will maintain larger amounts of components classified as raw material acquired from third parties to avoid production delays if deliveries by our suppliers are late 
however  in order to avoid production inefficiencies caused by fluctuating production levels  we will level out our production volumes and build finished goods of our standard non custom products to meet future orders 
this may cause fluctuations in our quarterly inventory levels 
inventories decreased from  at december  to  at december  principally because of a  decrease in finished goods offsetting the effect of shipments that were deferred from december to early and a  decrease in raw materials because of better inventory controls 
our current liabilities tend to fluctuate based on the timing of when liabilities are incurred and paid 
the largest single source of fluctuation has been income tax liabilities  and those fluctuations are generally a function of the timing and amount of estimated tax payments in relation to actual tax liabilities 
the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  which we believe is more properly related to the sale of our stock which is a financing activity  fluctuates based principally on when employees choose to exercise their vested stock options 
tax benefits from the exercise of stock options fluctuated from  in to  in to  in options exercised were   and  in the respective years  with the balance in the fluctuation related to differences between the market prices at date of exercise and exercise prices in each year 
we expect that sales of our products will continue to grow in if sales continue to increase  accounts receivable and inventories are expected to increase as well 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect the use of working capital to fund our operations to continue to increase 
we have a large cash and liquid investment position generated from profitable operations and stock sales  principally from the exercise of employee stock options 
we maintain this position to fund our growth  meet increasing working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  and potentially to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that may arise 
our primary investment goal is capital preservation  as further described in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  our liquid investments have very little credit risk or market risk 
we believe that our existing working capital  supplemented by income from operations  will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we have agreed to indemnify officers and directors of the company to the maximum extent permitted under delaware law and to indemnify customers as to certain intellectual property matters related to sales of our products 
there is no maximum limit on the indemnification that may be required under these agreements 
we have never incurred  nor do we expect to incur  any liability for indemnification 
except for indemnification agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations of approximately the following amounts 
these amounts exclude purchase orders for goods and services for current delivery  we do not have any long term purchase commitments for such items 
payments due less than year total from december  property and equipment   forward looking statements various portions of this report  including this management s discussion and analysis  describe trends in our business and finances that we perceive and state some of our expectations and beliefs about our future 
these statements about the future are forward looking statements  and we identify them by using words such as believe  expect  estimate  plan  will  continue  could  may  and by similar expressions and statements about aims  goals and plans 
the forward looking statements are based on the best information currently available to us and assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but we do not intend the statements to be representations as to future results 
they include  among other things  statements about o future operating results and various elements of operating results  including sales and unit volumes of products  future license  royalty and revenue share income  production costs  gross margins  sg a  and r d expense and income taxes  o factors affecting operating results  such as shipments to specific customers  expansion in international markets  selling prices  the market shift to needleless technology  future increases or decreases in sales of certain products and in certain markets and distribution channels  impact of safety legislation  increases in systems capabilities  introduction and sales of new products  manufacturing efficiencies  unit manufacturing costs  acquisition and use of production equipment and expansion of facilities and assembly capacity  expansion of markets and the need for additional facilities  business seasonality and fluctuations in quarterly results  and customer ordering patterns  o new or extended contracts with manufacturers and buying organizations  and dependence on a small number of customers  effect of abbott s spin off of its hospital products division  effect of contract amendments with abbott  long term effects of termination of the b 
braun clave agreement  ability to replace distributors  and the outcome of our strategic initiatives  o regulatory approval and outcome of litigation  competitive and market factors  including continuing development of competing products by other manufacturers  consolidation of the healthcare provider market and downward pressure on selling prices  and working capital requirements  changes in accounts receivable and inventories  current liabilities  capital expenditures  acquisitions of other businesses or product lines  indemnification liabilities  contractual liabilities and common stock repurchases 
the kinds of statements described above and similar forward looking statements about our future performance are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which one should consider in evaluating the statements 
first  one should consider the factors and risks described in the statements themselves 
those factors are uncertain  and if one or more of them turn out differently than we currently expect  our operating results may differ materially from our current expectations 
second  one should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk factors in our current report on form k to the securities and exchange commission dated february  which is incorporated by reference 
third  our actual future operating results are subject to other important factors that we cannot predict or control  including among others the following o general economic and business conditions  o the effect of price and safety considerations on the healthcare industry  o competitive factors  such as product innovation  new technologies  marketing and distribution strength and price erosion  o unanticipated market shifts and trends  o the impact of legislation affecting government reimbursement of healthcare costs  o changes by our major customers and independent distributors in their strategies that might affect their efforts to market our products  o unanticipated production problems  and o the availability of patent protection and the cost of enforcing and of defending patent claims 
we disclaim any obligation to update the statements or to announce publicly the result of any revision to any of the statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a portfolio of corporate preferred stocks and federal tax exempt state and municipal government debt securities 
the securities are all investment grade and we believe that we have virtually no exposure to credit risk 
dividend and interest rates reset at auction for most of the securities from between seven and forty nine day intervals  with some longer but none beyond twelve months  so we have very little market risk  that is  risk that the fair value of the security will change because of changes in market interest rates  they are readily saleable at par at auction dates  and can normally be sold at par between auction dates 
our future earnings are subject to potential increase or decrease because of changes in short term interest rates 
generally  each one percentage point change in the discount rate will cause our overall yield to change by two thirds to three quarters of a percentage point  depending upon the relative mix of federal tax exempt securities and corporate preferred stocks in the portfolio and market conditions specific to the securities in which we invest 
at december  we had outstanding commercial loans of approximately  loans are made only to credit worthy parties and are fully secured by real and personal property 
we plan to hold the loans until maturity or payoff 
maturities are five years or less and the weighted average maturity principal and interest payments is years 
because of the relatively small amount of the commercial loans  market risk is not significant to our financial statements 
we do not have any significant foreign currency risk 
sales to foreign distributors are all denominated in us dollars 
cash and receivables in entities outside the united states  principally in mexico and italy  which are denominated in foreign currency are insignificant and are generally offset by accounts payable in the same foreign currency
