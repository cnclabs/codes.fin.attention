overview we are one of the nation s leading full service multi family finance companies 
we focus on providing both capital solutions to developers and owners of multi family rental housing throughout the country  as well as quality investment products to institutional and retail investors 
collectively  we and our subsidiaries offer financing for every part of a multi family property s capital structure 
we are a delaware statutory trust 
our subsidiaries which hold the tax exempt revenue bonds are either treated as partnerships or disregarded for federal income tax purposes  and therefore we pay no federal income taxes on this portion of our income 
this tax exempt income is passed along  in the form of distributions  to our shareholders 
conversely  our mortgage banking  fund management and credit enhancement activities are conducted in subsidiaries organized as corporations  and generate taxable income  which is also passed along  in the form of distributions  to our shareholders 
portfolio investing and low income housing tax credits a large portion of our business  as it currently structured  focuses on providing debt financing to developers of affordable  multi family housing  which we accomplish by investing in tax exempt revenue bonds issued by state and local governments or their agencies to finance affordable multi family housing 
these tax exempt revenue bonds have tax credits attached to them  which are passed along to investors 
typically  the investors acquire a direct limited partnership interest in an upper tier  or investment partnership 
the investment partnership  in turn  invests as a limited partner in one or more lower tier  or operating partnerships  that own and operate the housing projects 
the tax credits are allocated on a state by state basis for investments in qualifying affordable housing properties 
the tax credit rate is set by the internal revenue service and is earned over a ten year period starting at the point the construction or rehabilitation is completed 
the property must continue to qualify as an affordable housing property for an additional years  or a portion of the tax credits can be recaptured 
limited partners in the investment partnerships are most often corporations who are able to utilize the tax benefits and  in most cases  derive no economic benefit from the investment other than the expected tax credits and tax losses from the operations 
in some cases  in conjunction with the final disposition of the property  there may be some additional return to the limited partners 
investors  however  anticipate that the partnership will generate housing credits and tax losses  including depreciation and interest expense  over the life of the property  which will be almost entirely allocated to the limited partners 
we also guarantee third party mortgage loans and tax credit specified returns to investors in tax credit equity funds  for which we receive a fee 
the table below shows selected information regarding our portfolio investing activities for the year ended december  in thousands acquisitions weighted average interest net of revenue bonds acquired revenue bonds repaid revenue bond interest income interest expense and securitizations fees loss on impairment of revenue bonds gain loss on repayments of revenue bonds the fair value and gross unrealized losses of our revenue bonds aggregated by length of time that individual bonds have been in a continuous unrealized loss position  at december   is summarized in the table below in thousands less than months months or more total fair value gross unrealized loss our ability to find attractive investments have been strong and we expect it to continue to be so 
our intent is to diversify our revenue bond holdings  both in terms of geographic regions and relationships with developers 
we intend to maintain our current market share in states where we already have a strong presence and identify regions where we can increase our presence 
the low interest rate environment was extremely favorable for us in bma  the short term tax exempt index  continues to be at historic lows  having averaged only for the year ended december  and remaining under since the beginning of our weighted average cost of debt at december  was approximately  taking into effect our current hedging 
we continue to recognize healthy spreads between our cost of borrowing and the interest rates on our revenue bonds 
the interest rates on our tax exempt first mortgage bonds for had a weighted average permanent interest rate of and our entire tax exempt first mortgage bond portfolio had a weighted average interest rate of at year end 
based upon recent comments by the federal reserve board  we believe short term rates will remain relatively low throughout most of therefore  we have decided to focus our hedging activity on and beyond 
we have entered into six different tbma swap transactions with an aggregate notional amount of million  all which provide protection beginning in these swaps have a weighted average term of years 
we face increasing levels of competition both in terms of new competitors and new competing products 
some of our competitions have substantially greater financial and operational resources than we do 
however  we believe we are able to effectively compete based on our long standing relationships with developers  our direct purchase program and our broad array of product offerings 
we continually seek to develop new products that will compete not only with other tax exempt lending products  but with the expansive number of taxable products that exist in the market place 
mortgage banking through pwf  we are also a mortgage banker  originating and servicing multi family mortgage loans on behalf of government sponsored entities gses  including  among others  fannie mae  freddie mac  and fha 
pwf originates third party mortgage loans  for which it receives origination fees 
pwf initially funds the loans  which are subsequently purchased by the gses 
pwf retains the mortgage servicing rights msrs on mortgages that it originates and receives fees for providing that service 
we have exposure to loss related to the msrs pwf retains in connection with the loans originated for fannie mae  pursuant to the terms of a master loss sharing agreement with fannie mae 
the table below shows selected information regarding pwf s mortgage banking activities for the year ended december  in thousands originations total loans serviced mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing fees mortgage origination fees while pwf s loan originations declined in compared to  of the loans closed in  nearly three quarters were new loans rather than portfolio refinancings  which add valuable new servicing to the portfolio 
we are committed to aggressively growing pwf s market share as an agency lender and have begun to make strides to do so 
last year  pwf was selected as one of freddie mac program plus seller servicers approved to originate targeted affordable loans for freddie mac on a national basis  as part of freddie mac s push to increase their presence in the affordable housing market 
we believe that this designation should increase the amount of our freddie mac deal flow 
in november  pwf opened an office in kansas city  which should increase our presence in the midwest 
this individual will be focusing on managing our company s market rate multifamily product lines 
we continue to offer a wide array of competitive products to multi family developers  but are continually working with fannie mae  freddie mac  fha and ginnie mae to develop new  attractive products and to participate in new lending programs they may initiate 
fund management through our acquisition on november   of related  we now provide management services to real estate equity investment funds we sponsor and a publicly traded real estate investment trust that originates and acquires a variety of taxable construction  permanent  bridge  mezzanine and participating mortgage debt for multi family housing 
the funds we sponsor are the upper tier investment funds  discussed above  that provide low income housing tax credits for investors 
this is a new line of business for us  which we expect will generate significant revenues 
related s fund management activities generate origination and acquisition fees associated with originating real estate equities investment funds and acquiring the assets that will be included in these funds 
related also receives asset management fees and partnership management fees for the services we perform for the funds we sponsor once they are operating 
related had a record year in while related s efforts from january to november did not impact us directly  related raised over million in tax credit equity from institutional investors for its investment funds  which is a increase over this represents an approximate market share for all tax credit equity raised in  which clearly makes related one of the leading tax credit fund managers 
our acquisition of related has enabled us to accomplish many of our goals 
first  we are now internally managed  which has eliminated any perceived conflicts of interest in the market place and should broaden our access to capital 
internalizing management has also created a more effective cost structure for a company of our size 
second  the acquisition diversifies our revenue streams 
similar to our mortgage banking subsidiary  pwf  related derives its revenue from fee income  which is much less interest rate sensitive and much less capital intensive than our core portfolio investing business 
we face many competitors  some of whom have substantially greater financial and operational resources than we do 
however  we feel we can effectively compete due to our on going relationships with certain developers 
to the extent the economy softens in certain markets  we may not be able to find sufficient investments that meet our investment criteria 
additionally continued consolidation especially within the banking industry may decrease our investor pool 
results of operations the following is a summary of our operations for the years ended december   and net income for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  in thousands change change revenue bond interest income fee income mortgage banking fees n a n a fund management fees n a n a n a n a other income total revenues total revenues for the year ended december   increased by approximately or million over  primarily due to increases in revenue bond interest income of approximately or million and million in fund management fees 
the increase in revenue bond interest income is primarily due to new bonds acquired during the fourth quarter of and during the increase in fund management fees represents the fee income earned by related for the period from november  to december  total revenues for the year ended december   increased by approximately  or million over  primarily due to increases in revenue bond interest income of approximately or million and million in mortgage banking fees 
the increase in revenue bond interest income is primarily due to new bonds acquired during the fourth quarter of and during the increase in mortgage banking fees represents pwf s fees subsequent to our acquisition of pwf in december expenses for the year ended december  in thousands change change interest expense interest expense distribution to preferred shareholders of subsidiary n a n a n a n a recurring fees securitizations general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of assets total expenses total expenses increased approximately or million for the year ended december  versus  primarily due to increases of  or million in general and administrative expenses and million in interest expense represented by distributions to our preferred shareholders 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly due to our acquisition of related and the associated recognition of approximately million in expenses for the period from november  through december  the largest components of related s general and administrative expenses are approximately million in salaries and benefits and approximately million in origination and offering o o costs 
we initially record all o o costs associated with the set up of new investment partnerships as receivables and immediately charge the total to expense  due to the fact we are not able to reliably quantify the amount of o o expenses the investments will reimburse to us 
to the extent these costs are reimbursed by the investment funds  we reverse the expense 
the increase in interest expense distribution to preferred shareholders of subsidiary when compared to the reclassified amount of income allocated to preferred shareholders is approximately million  attributable to the preferred offering consummated on june  total expenses increased approximately  or million for the year ended december  versus  primarily due to increases of approximately million in general and administrative expenses and million in depreciation and amortization 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our acquisition of pwf and the growth of our company 
depreciation and amortization increased in from primarily due to the amortization of pwf s mortgage servicing rights 
other items for the year ended december  in thousands change change equity in earnings of arcap gain on sale of loans n a gain loss on repayment of revenue bonds n a income allocated to preferred shareholders of subsidiary income allocated to special common units loss income allocated to minority interest n a benefit provision for income taxes n a gains on sales of loans decreased approximately or million for the year ended december  versus  due to the decrease in pwf s loan origination activity in versus the total income allocated to preferred shareholders of subsidiary for the year ended december   including the portion reclassified to interest expense  increased approximately million as compared to  attributable to the preferred offering consummated on june  the income allocated to special common units represents the distributions payable to the holders of the scus for the period from november  to december  the change in the benefit provision for income taxes results from the receipt of guarantee fee  construction service fees  asset management and partnership management fees which are recognized currently for income tax purpose but earned over the time such services are preformed 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on repayment of revenue bonds of approximately million versus a loss of approximately  in  due to differences in the number and size of revenue bonds repaid 
income allocated to preferred shareholders of subsidiary increased or million due to preferred offerings consummated on october  and june  liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity provided by operations comes primarily from interest income from revenue bonds and promissory notes in excess of the related financing costs  mortgage origination and servicing fees  and fund management fees 
for the year ended december   we had net cash from operations of approximately million 
additionally  we have entered into three revolving warehouse facilities  one  in the amount of million  used by pwf  another  in the amount of million  used by us to fund mortgage loans and investments in revenue bonds on a short term basis and the third in the amount of million used by related to acquire equity interests in property ownership entities prior to the inclusion of these equity interests into investment funds 
the pwf facility is renewable annually  the chartermac facility matures march   with a one year extension at our option  and the related facility matures on october  on november   cm corp 
entered into million and million acquisition bridge loan facilities with wachovia bank in order to fund the cash portion  fees and expenses of our acquisition of related 
these bridge loan facilities have a nine month term with two day extension options 
we have pledged our common ownership interest in equity issuer as security under these facilities 
the facilities are pre payable at any time and bear interest at libor plus and  respectively 
our long term liquidity needs are met using primarily two sources of capital collateralized debt securitization and various types of equity offerings 
we believe that our financing capacity and cash flow from current operations are adequate to meet our current and projected liquidity requirements 
management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
the following table summarizes  on a gross basis  our and our subsidiaries capital raising activities

negative amount is due to the principal pay down of the pw acquisition facility 
negative amount is due to the principal pay down of the pw warehouse line 
convertible community reinvestment act preferred share offerings we first issued convertible cra shares during since then the program has become increasingly popular with a broad range of banks that invest in our shares to both make an investment in us and to make a qualifying community reinvestment act investment 
at december  different banks had invested in our convertible cra shares 
during we issued  convertible cra shares raising gross proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had  shares outstanding  of which  shares are convertible at the holders options into  common shares 
the remaining  shares are convertible on a one to one basis 
our convertible cra shares continue to be a viable method to raise capital  which we intend to continue to use in the future 
securitizations and debt financings we use floating rate securitization programs to leverage our portfolio of revenue bonds to generate capital for the acquisition of additional revenue bonds 
in each of our securitization programs  we contribute revenue bonds into trusts  which are generally credit enhanced by investment grade rated third party entities and then floating rate certificates are sold out of the trust 
we retain a residual interest in each of the trusts 
we use two primary securitization programs mbia securitizations and p floats rites p float program 
under our mbia securitizations  pools of bonds are contributed into trusts  which are credit enhanced by mbia  a large financial insurer  and then low floater certificates are sold 
the low floater certificates sold have an interest rate that is reset weekly floating rate or an interest rate that is reset periodically based on a dutch auction process auction rate securitizations 
mbia has agreed to provide us with up to million in credit enhancement through using the mbia credit enhancement we can complete up to million of floating rate securitizations and million of auction rate securitization 
at december   we had million of floating rate securitization and million of auction rate securitizations outstanding 
in the p floats program  merrill lynch deposits individual revenue bonds into a special purpose trust and provides a credit enhancement guarantee enabling the trust to sell a weekly reset floating rate security 
we are required to post additional bonds with merrill lynch as collateral for the credit enhancement provided 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding revenue bonds under the p floats program during  we completed an new fixed rate securitization  whereby we sold million of two year certificates with a fixed rate of collateralized by million bonds and requiring no credit enhancement 
our continued ability to raise capital through the use of securitization programs is dependent on the following factors i the availability of seasoned bonds to be used in securitizations or as excess collateral  ii the depth of the market of buyers for tax exempt floating rate investments and iii our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with credit enhancers 
we continue to actively manage our balance sheet and our relationships to mitigate the impact of the factors listed above and to continue to diversify our sources of capital 
we believe that our current financing capacity and cash flow from current operations are adequate to meet our current and projected liquidity requirements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions sometimes involve future events which cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  our determination of estimates requires that we exercise our judgment 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different results may actually occur and any such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
investment in revenue bonds we account for our investments in revenue bonds as available for sale debt securities under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas due to a provision in most of our revenue bonds under which we have a right to require redemption of the revenue bonds prior to their maturity  although we can and may elect to hold them up to their maturity dates unless otherwise modified 
as such  sfas requires us to classify these investments as available for sale 
accordingly  investments in revenue bonds are carried at their estimated fair values  with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
unrealized gains or losses do not affect the cash flow generated from property operations  distributions to shareholders  the characterization of the tax exempt income stream or the financial obligations under the revenue bonds 
if  in our judgment  it is determined probable that we will not receive all contractual payments required  when they are due  the revenue bond is deemed impaired and is written down to its then estimated fair value  with the amount of the write down accounted for as a realized loss 
because revenue bonds have a limited market  we estimate the fair value for each bond as the present value of its expected cash flows using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
this process is based upon projections of future economic events affecting the real estate collateralizing the bonds  such as property occupancy rates  rental rates  operating cost inflation  market capitalization rates and an appropriate market rate of interest  all of which are based on good faith estimates and assumptions developed by us 
changes in market conditions and circumstances may occur which would cause these estimates and assumptions to change  therefore  actual results may vary from the estimates and the variance may be material 
for certain revenue bonds  we believe that certain factors have impacted the near term fair value 
in these instances  the revenue bonds are valued at either the outstanding face amount of the bond or management s estimate of the fair value  whichever is lower 
mortgage banking activities pwf is an approved seller servicer of multi family mortgage loans for fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae 
for fannie mae  pwf is approved under the dus program 
under dus  upon obtaining a commitment from fannie mae with regard to a particular loan  fannie mae commits to acquire the mortgage loan based upon pwf s underwriting and pwf agrees to bear a portion of the risk of potential losses in the event of a default 
fannie mae commitments may be made to acquire the mortgage loan for cash or in exchange for a mortgage backed security backed by the mortgage loan 
as a program plus lender for freddie mac  freddie mac agrees to acquire for cash from pwf loans for which pwf has issued commitments 
ginnie mae agrees to exchange fha insured mortgages originated by pwf for ginnie mae securities 
mortgage loans originated for fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae are closed in the name of pwf  which uses corporate cash obtained by borrowing from a warehouse lender to fund the loans 
approximately a week to a month following closing of a loan  loan documentation and an assignment are delivered to fannie mae  freddie mac  ginnie mae  or a document custodian on its behalf and the cash purchase price or mortgage backed security is delivered to pwf 
pwf uses the cash it receives to repay its warehouse loans and the mortgage backed securities are sold pursuant to prior agreements for cash  which is also used to repay warehouse loans 
pwf also underwrites and originates multi family and commercial mortgages for insurance companies and banks 
pwf receives origination fees which are included in mortgage banking fees in the consolidated statements of income 
neither we nor pwf retains any interest in any of the mortgage loans  except for mortgage servicing rights msrs and certain liabilities under the loss sharing arrangement with fannie mae 
mortgage servicing rights pwf recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others  whether the msrs are acquired through a separate purchase or through loan origination  by allocating total costs incurred between the loan and the msrs retained based on their relative fair value 
msrs are being carried at their adjusted cost basis 
msrs are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
we have two areas of loss exposure related to pwf s lending activities 
first  while a loan is recorded on the balance sheet  there is exposure to potential loss if a loan becomes impaired and defaults 
second  we have exposure to loss due to the retention of a portion of credit risk within pwf s servicing contract under the fannie mae dus program 
when a loan is owned by pwf and recorded on the balance sheet  pwf identifies loans that are impaired and evaluates the allowance for loss on a specific loan basis for losses believed to currently exist in the recorded loan portfolio 
an impaired loan is defined  as noted within accounting guidance  when pwf determine it is probable that not all required contractual payments will be made when due 
pwf s primary tool for determining which loans are likely to currently have a loss associated with them is to evaluate the debt service coverage ratio based on pwf s historical experience of similar properties and the frequency of such losses 
loans that are impaired and specific loans that are not impaired but have debt service coverage ratios below a certain threshold  which indicates a high likelihood of future foreclosure and currently have an existing loss  are evaluated 
the estimate of currently existing loss includes the estimated severity of the loss which would include any advances made or existing property loss 
property maintenance costs when foreclosure occurs are expensed when incurred and not included in the loss estimate 
however  as most loans are sold very quickly after origination  there typically is not a significant amount of loan loss allowance recorded 
we have exposure to loss due to pwf s retention of a portion of credit risk within pwf s servicing contract under the fannie mae dus program 
for loans which have been sold as commercial mortgage backed securities for which pwf retains the servicing under fannie mae s dus program  pwf s share of loss is associated with the servicing contract and determined in accordance with the loss sharing provisions under the program 
prior to the issuance of interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  because the loss sharing on these serviced loans was associated with the servicing contract  they were valued within the servicing right and the anticipated cash flows that are associated with such servicing activities 
we have determined that these potential losses are guarantees under the definition of fin and therefore  record an asset and a corresponding liability based on our estimate of the portion of the servicing cash flows deemed to represent compensation for our guarantee for loans originated on or after january  on an ongoing basis  we will account for the asset by offsetting cash received for the guarantee against the asset and crediting interest income for the change in asset due to the passage of time 
the portion of the liability representing an accrual for probable losses under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies fas is adjusted as loss estimates change  the portion representing our willingness to stand by as guarantor will be amortized over the expected life of the guarantee 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from a variety of investments and guarantees  summarized as follows revenue bond interest income interest income is recognized at the stated rate as it accrues and when collectibility of future amounts is reasonably assured 
participating interest is recognized when received 
interest income from revenue bonds with modified terms or where the collectibility of future amounts is uncertain is recognized based upon expected cash receipts 
certain construction revenue bonds carry different interest rates during the construction and permanent financing periods 
in these cases  we calculate the effective yield on the revenue bond and use that rate to recognize interest income over the life of the bond 
mortgage banking fees mortgage banking fees pwf fees earned for arranging financings under the fannie mae dus product line or on behalf of freddie mac  insurance companies and banks or other lenders are recorded at the point the financing commitment is accepted or the mortgagor and the interest rate of the mortgage loan is fixed 
mortgage servicing fees pwf receives fees for servicing the loans it has originated or purchased 
this income is recognized on an accrual basis over the estimated life of the loans being serviced 
fund management fees origination fees origination fees include both property acquisition fees and partnership management fees which are received by related from the proceeds raised at formation of the investment funds 
property acquisition fees generally to of equity raised are for services performed in connection with the acquisition of interests in property owning partnerships and are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collectibility is reasonably assured  which is defined as the date the investor equity is raised and the properties have been acquired by the investment fund 
partnership management fees generally of equity raised are for services to be performed by related for i maintaining the books and records of the investment fund  including requisite investor reporting  and ii monitoring the acquired property interests to ensure that their development  leasing and operations comply with low income housing or other tax credit requirements 
related recognizes these fees when such services are rendered  which  per the partnership agreements  are contractually over five years following the initial closing of the investment fund  using the straight line method 
acquisition fees acquisition fees are earned upon acquisition of investments by publicly held entities for which related acts as the advisor 
these fees are calculated as a percentage of the purchase price of investments acquired  up to 
development fees development fees are earned from properties co developed by related with unaffiliated developers and sold to investment funds 
recognition of development fees is based on completion and stabilization of properties  after guarantees of completion and deficits are no longer deemed to require funding 
the guarantees are issued by another one of our subsidiaries on behalf of related and as required by the investment fund 
asset management fees related earns asset management fees from its investment funds on an annual basis calculated based on a percentage of each investment fund s invested assets  generally 
these fees are paid from the investment fund s available working capital balances  and are earned by related for managing the underlying property assets of the investment fund 
these fees are recorded monthly as earned  but only when the management of related determines that collection is reasonably assured based on the investment funds working capital balance 
amounts not recorded as revenues  due to inadequate working capital at the investment fund level  are due upon sale or refinancing of the fund s properties  receipt of such amounts is highly uncertain 
the alternative accounting would be to accrue the full amount of the fees and then reserve for the portion that management estimates will not be paid until there is a sale or refinancing of the underlying properties in the investment fund 
related believes that the assessment of collectibility is an integral part of revenue recognition  if this factor was not considered  net income and assets could be materially overstated 
the investment funds are separate legal entities that are subject to factors and market conditions that are beyond the control of related  and may not generate adequate cash to pay all fees due to related 
other income interest income from promissory notes and mortgages receivable interest on mortgage loans and notes receivable is recognized on the accrual basis as it becomes due 
deferred loan origination costs and fees are amortized over the life of the applicable loan as an adjustment to interest income  using the interest method 
interest which was accrued is reversed out of income if deemed to be uncollectible 
other interest income interest income from temporary investments  such as cash in banks and short term instruments  is recognized on the accrual basis as it becomes due 
construction service fees cm corp 
receives fees  in advance  from borrowers for servicing revenue bonds during the construction period 
these fees are deferred and amortized into other income over the anticipated construction period 
credit enhancement and guarantee fees cm corp 
and related receive fees for providing credit enhancement and for backing up primary guarantors obligations to guarantee agreed upon internal rates of return to the investors in programs sponsored by related 
the credit enhancement fees are received monthly and recognized in other income when received 
the guarantee fees are deferred and recognized in other income on a prorata basis over the guarantee periods 
equity in earnings of arcap our equity in the earnings of arcap is accrued at the preferred dividend rate of on the preferred shares we hold  unless arcap does not have earnings and cash flows adequate to meet this dividend requirement 
financial risk management and derivatives we have entered into several derivative instruments  including an interest rate cap  forward commitments and interest rate swaps  all of which are accounted for under the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended and interpreted 
we have designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on the variable interest payments on our floating rate securitizations 
two of the interest rate swaps do not become effective until the two interest rate swaps that are currently in place  are recorded at their respective fair market value each accounting period  with changes in market value being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedges are effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
these hedges have been perfectly effective  so have generated no ineffectiveness that needs to be included in earnings 
the effectiveness of the other two swaps is being measured using the hypothetical swap method  until they go into effect in for the year ended december   there was no ineffectiveness related to these two swaps 
had there been any ineffectiveness or should there be any ineffectiveness in the future  the amount would have flowed or will flow through our consolidated statements of income 
the interest rate cap  although designed to mitigate our exposure to rising interest rates  was not designated as a hedging derivative  therefore  any change in fair market value flows through the consolidated statements of income  where it is included in interest income 
the forward commitments create derivative instruments under sfas  which have been designated as cash flow hedges of the anticipated funding of the revenue bonds  and  as such  are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the revenue bonds are funded 
income taxes effective july   we began operation of a new wholly owned  taxable subsidiary  cm corp  which conducts most of our taxable business  including any mortgage servicing activities and fund management activities in which we may engage 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
fas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
share options and share awards we have issued options to employees for our common shares 
we have issued restricted common shares to non employees and employees  some of which vested immediately upon issuance and some of which vest over various periods ranging from nine months to four years 
additionally  we have issued scus of ccc to some employees  which vest in and we account for our share options in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  compensation cost is accrued based on the estimated fair value of the options issued  and amortized over the vesting period 
because vesting of the options is contingent upon the recipient continuing to provide services to us until the vesting date  we estimate the fair value of the share options at each period end up to the vesting date  and adjust the expense accordingly 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
our share awards have been recorded as a separate deferred compensation line in the equity section of our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the deferred compensation expense was calculated as the number of shares awarded at the average of the high and low price of our common shares at the date of award  which was 
individuals holding those awards are entitled to dividends on their shares  even if the shares have not yet vested 
any such payments will be recorded directly to beneficial owner s equity other common shareholders 
however  if any individual should forfeit their awards  any amounts previously recorded directly to beneficial owner s equity  would be reversed and charged to compensation expense 
the amount of the deferred compensation will be charged to compensation expense on a pro rata basis over the relevant vesting period 
goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of related  we have recorded goodwill in the amount of approximately million and identifiable intangible assets in the aggregate amount of million 
the intangible assets were recorded at this fair value as verified by an independent third party valuation firm and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the goodwill is the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired including deferred tax liabilities  and is not being amortized 
we have adopted fas no 
and which required us to test the goodwill for impairment at least annually and more often if circumstances indicate there may be reason to believe goodwill has been impaired 
any such impairment would be charged to expense in the period in which it is determined 
additionally  the useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets may need to be reassessed and amortization accelerated  or such intangible assets could be deemed impaired 
any such amounts could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

under the fannie mae dus product line  pwf originates  underwrites and services mortgage loans on multi family residential properties and sells the project loans directly to fannie mae 
pwf assumes responsibility for a portion of any loss that may result from borrower defaults  based on the fannie mae loss sharing formulas  levels i  ii or iii 
at december   all of pwf s loans consisted of level i loans 
for such loans  pwf is responsible for the first of the unpaid principal balance and a portion of any additional losses to a maximum of of the original principal balance 
level ii and level iii loans carry a higher loss sharing percentage 
fannie mae bears any remaining loss 
under the terms of the master loss sharing agreement between fannie mae and pwf  pwf is responsible for funding of mortgagor delinquency principal and interest and servicing taxes  insurance and foreclosure costs advances until the amounts advanced exceed of the unpaid principal balance at the date of default 
thereafter  for level i loans  we may request interim loss sharing adjustments which allow us to fund of such advances until final settlement under the master loss sharing agreement 
no interim loss sharing adjustments are available for level ii and level iii loans 
we maintain an accrued liability for probable losses under fas for loans originated under the fannie mae dus product line at a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to provide for estimated losses 
at december   that liability was approximately million  which we believe represents its probable liability at this time 
unlike loans originated for fannie mae  pwf does not share the risk of loss for loans pwf originates for freddie mac or fha 
in connection with the pwf warehouse line  both our company and cm corp 
have entered into guarantees for the benefit of fleet national bank fleet  guaranteeing the total advances drawn under the line  up to the maximum of million  together with interest  fees  costs  and charges related to the pwf warehouse line 
pwf maintains  as of december   treasury notes of approximately million and a money market account of approximately million  which is included in cash and cash equivalents restricted in the consolidated balance sheet  to satisfy the fannie mae collateral requirements of million 
due to the nature of pwf s mortgage banking activities  pwf is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies 
among other things  these agencies require pwf to meet certain minimum net worth requirements  as defined 
pwf met these requirements for all agencies  as applicable  as of december  at december   pwf had commitments of approximately million to five borrowers 
off balance sheet arrangements credit enhancement transaction in december  cm corp 
completed a credit enhancement transaction with merrill lynch capital services  inc mlcs 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  cm corp 
assumed mlcs s million first loss position on a million pool of tax exempt weekly variable rate multi family mortgage loans 
trclp  has provided cm corp 
with an indemnity covering of any losses that are incurred by cm corp 
as part of this transaction 
as the loans mature or prepay  the first loss exposure and the fees paid to cm corp 
will both be reduced 
the latest maturity date on any loan in the portfolio occurs in the remainder of the real estate exposure after the million first loss position has been assumed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
in connection with the transaction  we have guaranteed the obligations of cm corp  and have met its obligation to post collateral  in an amount equal to of the first loss amount 
our maximum exposure under the terms of this transaction is approximately million 
during  two of the tax exempt weekly variable rate multi family mortgage loans were repaid in the amount of million 
these repayments reduced the first loss position to million and the pool of multi family mortgage loans to million 
this reduced our maximum exposure under the terms of the transaction to approximately million 
cm corp 
performed due diligence on each property in the pool  including an examination of loan to value and debt service coverage both on a current and stressed basis 
cm corp 
analyzed the portfolio on a stressed basis by increasing capitalization rates and assuming an increase in the low floater bond rate 
as of december   the credit enhanced pool of properties are performing according to their contractual obligations and we do not anticipate any losses to be incurred on its guaranty 
should the company s analysis of risk of loss change in the future  a provision for probable loss might be required  such provision could be material 
yield guarantee transactions cm corp 
has entered into six agreements with merrill lynch the primary guarantor to guarantee agreed upon rates of return for three pools of multi family properties each owned by a local partnership which in turn  is majority owned by affiliates of related for which cm corp 
has or will receive guarantee fees 
each transaction was structured as two separate guarantees  one primarily guaranteeing the returns through the lease up phase of the properties and the other guaranteeing the returns through the operating phase of the properties 
cm corp 
receives a fee for each guarantee up front at the start of each guarantee period 
these fees will be recognized in income on a straight line basis over the period of the respective guarantees 
total potential exposure pursuant to these guarantees is approximately million 
we have analyzed the expected operations of the underlying properties and believe there is no risk of loss at this time 
should our analysis of risk of loss change in the future  a provision for possible losses might be required  such provision could be material 
we account for these guarantees under the fin we have determined that the fees received represent the fair value of the respective liabilities and accordingly have recorded such fees as a liability included in deferred income on our consolidated balance sheets 
some of the local partnerships have financed their properties with the proceeds of our revenue bonds 
in these cases  the primary guarantor has required that those revenue bonds be deposited into a trust pursuant to which the revenue bonds were divided into senior and subordinated interests with approximately of each revenue bond being subordinated 
we have financed the senior trust interest as part of the merrill lynch p floatssm ritessm program 
the subordinate trust interests are being used as collateral in other of our company s financing programs 
in connection with these transactions  we have posted million as collateral with the primary guarantor in the form of either cash or revenue bonds 
revenue bond forward transactions we have entered into six transactions to purchase revenue bonds pursuant to agreements which require us  at the earlier of stabilization or conversion to permanent financing to acquire series a and series b revenue bonds at a predetermined price and interest rates 
we are obligated to purchase the revenue bonds only if construction is completed 
we are obligated to buy the series b revenue bonds only if  at the date the series a bonds are stabilized  the property s cash flow is sufficient to provide debt service coverage of x for both the series a and b bonds 
an unrelated third party lender will advance funds to the developer  as needed during the construction period  at a floating rate 
these forward commitments create derivative instruments under sfas no 
 which have been designated as a cash flow hedge of the anticipated funding of the revenue bonds  and are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income until the revenue bonds are funded 
the total potential amount we could possibly be required to fund is million 
other guarantees we have entered into three transactions related to three properties  coventry place  canyon springs and arbor ridge 
pursuant to the terms of these transactions  we will provide credit support to the construction lender for project completion and fannie mae permanent loan conversion and acquire subordinated bonds to the extent the construction period bonds do not fully convert 
up until the point of completion  we will reimburse the construction lender for any draw on its construction letter of credit up to of the stated amount of the letter of credit 
following completion  up until the project loan converts to permanent loan status  we will  should the need arise  reimburse the full amount of the letter of credit 
we closely monitor these two properties  and believes there is no need currently  to provide for any potential loss 
should our analysis of risk of loss change in the future  a provision for loss might be required  such provision could be material 
the developer has also issued several guarantees to the construction lender  each of which would be called upon before our guarantees  and each of which would be assigned to us should its guarantees be called 
once the construction loans convert to permanent loans  we are obligated to acquire subordinated loans for the amount by which each construction loan exceeds the corresponding permanent loan  if any 
the subordinated bonds will bear interest at 
under fannie mae guidelines  the size of the subordinated bonds will be limited to a x debt service coverage based on of the cash flow after the senior debt 
our maximum exposure  related to these two transactions  is of the stated amount of the letter of credit of approximately million

almost all of our recurring income is tax exempt 
from time to time we may sell or securitize various assets which may result in capital gains and losses 
this tax structure allows us to have the pass through income characteristics of a partnership for both taxable and tax exempt income 
we do not pay tax at the partnership level 
instead  the distributive share of our income  deductions and credits is reported to each shareholder for inclusion on their respective income tax return 
the tax exempt income derived from most of our revenue bonds remains tax exempt as it is passed through to shareholders 
any cash dividends received by us from subsidiaries  organized as corporations  will be recorded as dividend income for tax purposes 
for such subsidiaries  created in  there were no dividends distributed for tax purposes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
fas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we derive a substantial portion of our income from ownership of first mortgage private activity bonds 
the interest from these bonds is generally tax exempt from regular federal income tax 
however  the tax reform act of classifies the interest earned on private activity bonds issued after august  as a tax preference item for alternative minimum tax purposes amt 
the percentage of our tax exempt interest income subject to amt for the years ended december   and was approximately  and respectively 
amt is a mechanism within the internal revenue code to ensure that all taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of taxes 
all taxpayers are subject to the amt calculation requirements although the vast majority of taxpayers will not actually pay amt 
as a result of amt  the percentage of our income that is exempt from federal income tax may be different for each shareholder depending on that shareholder s individual tax situation 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued fin fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  cm corp 
entered into one credit enhancement transaction and two yield guarantee transactions prior to december  the fee for the credit enhancement transaction is received monthly and recognized as income when due 
the fees for the yield guarantee transactions  received in advance  were deferred and amortized over the guarantee periods 
during  cm corp 
entered into four more yield guarantee transactions 
we believe the fees received for these guarantees approximates the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantees and have recorded liabilities included in deferred income equal to the fair values of the obligations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employer compensation 
because we account for our share options using the fair value method  implementation of this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for our share options issued to non employees 
accordingly  compensation cost is accrued based on the estimated fair value of the options issued  and amortized over the vesting period 
because vesting of the options is contingent upon the recipient continuing to provide services to us until the vesting date  we estimate the fair value of the non employee options at each period end up to the vesting date  and adjust expensed amounts accordingly 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in connection with the purchase of related  we issued  restricted common shares to employees  of which  vested immediately 
the balance of  shares vest over two  three or four years depending on the number of shares granted to each employee 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for these employee grants 
accordingly  we recognized compensation expense for the vested shares at the market price for the shares on the grant date and deferred compensation expense for the non vested shares also at the market price on the grant date 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  which revises fin  codifying certain fasb staff positions and extending the implementation date 
fin  as revised by fin r  clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
prior to the issuance of fin r  we had not applied fin to any entities  accordingly  the provisions of fin r are effective for us beginning march  fin r is a complex standard that requires significant analysis and judgment 
we are still in the process of evaluating its impact on our financial statements  particularly as it applies to the investment fund sponsorship business we acquired by purchasing related in november of in that acquisition  and in subsequent fund originations  we  through our ownership of related  became the general partner or equivalent in over investment funds  all of which may represent variable interest entities under fin r 
as the general partner  and  in some cases  the guarantor of the underlying fund returns  we may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary of some or all of such entities  even though we have no equity investment in the investment partnerships 
if we determine that we are required to consolidate all of our investment partnerships under fin r  our total assets would increase by approximately billion 
the investment partnerships do not carry debt  so minority partners interest of approximately billion would be recorded between liabilities and equity on our balance sheet 
in recording our acquisition of related  we ascribed approximately million of the purchase price to the estimated future cash flows to be received from general partner interests in investment partnerships in which we maintain a non equity controlling partner 
however  from time to time the general partner of the investment funds  may be called upon to fund investment fund operations which we would advance on behalf of the general partner and would be repaid to us out of future operating cash flow or sale or refinancing proceeds received by the investment fund  so our maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified 
we also have exposure to losses under guarantees of returns on certain funds  as described in note in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that certain financial instruments that have the characteristics of debt and equity be classified as debt 
sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  pursuant to sfas no 
 on july  we have reclassed million previously shown in the mezzanine between liabilities and equity in the consolidated balance sheets as preferred shares of subsidiary subject to mandatory redemption into the liability section  and the dividends paid on such shares approximately million for the year ended december  has been classified as interest expense  dividends related to prior periods continue to be classified as income allocated to preferred shareholders of subsidiary 
the following recent pronouncements had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements sfas no

inflation inflation did not have a material effect on our results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in certain financial instruments  primarily revenue bonds and other bond related investments that are subject to various forms of market risk  including real estate risk  interest rate risk  credit and liquidity risk and prepayment risk 
we seek to prudently and actively manage such risks to earn sufficient compensation to justify the undertaking of such risks and to maintain capital levels which are commensurate with the risks we undertake 
real estate risk we derive income by investing in revenue bonds secured by multi family affordable residential properties 
investing in such revenue bonds collateralized by such properties subjects us to various types and degrees of risk that could adversely affect the value of our assets and our ability to generate revenue 
the factors that may reduce our revenues  net income and cash available for distributions to shareholders include the following the property securing a revenue bond may not generate income sufficient to meet its operating expenses and debt service on its related revenue bond  economic conditions  either local  regional or national  may limit the amount of rent that can be charged for rental units at the properties  and may result in a reduction in timely rent payments or a reduction in occupancy levels  occupancy and rent levels may be affected by construction of additional housing units and national  regional and local politics  including current or future rent stabilization and rent control laws and agreements  federal lihtc and city  state and federal housing subsidy or similar programs which apply to many of the properties  could impose rent limitations and adversely affect the ability to increase rents to maintain the properties in proper condition during periods of rapid inflation or declining market value of such properties  and  if a revenue bond defaults  the value of the property securing such revenue bond plus  for properties that have availed themselves of the federal lihtc  the value of such credit may be less than the face amount of such revenue bond 
all of these conditions and events may increase the possibility that a property owner may be unable to meet its obligations to us under its mortgage revenue bond 
this could affect our net income and cash available for distribution to shareholders 
we manage these risks through diligent and comprehensive underwriting  asset management and ongoing monitoring of loan performance 
we may be adversely affected by periods of economic or real estate downturns that result in declining property performance or property values 
any material decline in property values used as collateral for our revenue bonds increases the possibility of a loss in the event of default 
additionally  some of our income may come from additional interest received from the participation of a portion of the cash flow  sale or refinancing proceeds on underlying properties 
the collection of such additional interest may decrease in periods of economic slowdown due to lower cash flows or values available from the properties 
in a few instances  the revenue bonds are subordinated to the claims of other senior interest and uncertainties may exist as to a borrower s ability to meet principal and interest payments 
because of these economic factors  debt service on the revenue bonds  and therefore net income and cash available for distribution to shareholders is dependent on the performance of the underlying properties 
interest rate risk the nature of our investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose us to income and expense volatility due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
the revenue bonds generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under our floating rat securitization programs vary based on market interest rates based on tbma index and are re set weekly 
in addition  we have floating rate debt related to our acquisition financing of pwf and related and our warehouse facilities 
pwf has loans receivable and short term borrowings related to its mortgage origination operations which are not expected to subject pwf to significant interest rate risk 
pwf typically provides mortgages to borrowers mortgages receivable by borrowing from third parties short term borrowings 
since pwf s mortgages receivable are typically subject to a take out commitment by fannie mae  freddie mac or fha  the related borrowings to finance such mortgages are typically short term 
the interest income or expense that represents the difference between the interest charged to borrowers and the interest paid to pwf s lender during the warehousing period will be earned by pwf 
other long term sources of capital  such as equity issuer s various series of cumulative preferred shares  carry a fixed dividend rate and as such  are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
a rising interest rate environment could reduce the demand for multi family tax exempt and taxable financing  which could limit our ability to invest in revenue bonds or to structure transactions 
conversely  falling interest rates may prompt historical renters to become homebuyers  in turn potentially reducing the demand for multi family housing 
an effective interest rate management strategy can be complex and no strategy can insulate us from all potential risks associated with interest rate changes 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow us to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings 
beginning in  based upon management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  we entered into interest rate swaps in order to hedge a portion of the risk of rising interest rates and the impact of such a rise on our mbia and p floats programs 
on january   we entered into a five year interest swap that fixes bma index to on a notional amount of million 
on february   we entered into a three year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of an additional million 
we have designated both of these swaps on hedging derivatives and fas no 
during january  concurrent with our acquisition of pwf and pursuant to the financing put in place to complete the acquisition  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with fleet bank  with a cap of on a notional amount of million 
although this transaction is designed to mitigate our exposure to rising interest rates  we have not designated this interest rate cap as a hedging derivative under fas on december   we entered into a three year interest rate swap that fixes tbma at  beginning january  on a notional amount of million 
on december   we entered into a three year interest rate swap that fixes tbma at  and for the twelve months beginning january   january  and january   respectively  on a notional amount of million 
interest rate swap agreements are subject to risk of early termination by us or the counterparty  possibly at times unfavorable to us and  depending on market conditions at the time  may result in the recognition of a significant gain or loss from changes in the market value of the hedging instrument 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire hedging instruments at favorable prices  or at all  when the existing arrangements expire or are terminated which would then fully expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of the balance of debt subject to such hedges 
in addition  there is no assurance that the counterparty to these hedges will have the capacity to pay or perform under the stated terms of the interest rate swap agreement  however  we seek to enter into such agreements with reputable and investment grade rated counterparties 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended and interpreted  on january  accordingly  we have documented and established our policy for risk management and the related objectives and strategies for the use of derivative instruments to potentially mitigate such risks 
currently  our strategy is intended to reduce interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps 
at inception  we designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on the variable interest payments on its floating rate financing 
accordingly  the interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair market values each accounting period  with changes in market values being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
we assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the swap agreements are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged financing 
any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recorded in earnings 
there was no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship during  or  and we expect that these hedging relationships will be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flow throughout their terms 
net amounts payable or receivable under the swap agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   the combined fair market value of the two interest rate swaps we entered in was a liability of approximately million  included in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest paid or payable under the terms of the swaps of approximately million and million  is included in interest expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the combined fair market value of the two new interest rate swaps we entered into in was an asset of approximately million  included in the other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the interest rate cap was recorded as an asset with a fair market value of  included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
because we have not designated this derivative as a hedge  the change in fair market value flows through the consolidated statements of income  where it is included in interest income 
with respect to the portion of our floating rate financing programs which are not hedged  a change in tbma rate would result in increased or decreased payments under these financing programs  without a corresponding change in cash flows from the investments in revenue bonds 
for example  based on the un hedged million million outstanding under these financing programs at december   less the million notional amount subsequently hedged and assuming a perfect hedge correlation  we estimate that an increase of in tbma rate would decrease our annual net income by approximately million 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit us in the same amount described above  as a result of decreased allocations to the minority interest and interest expense without corresponding decreases in interest received on revenue bonds 
changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of our portfolio of revenue bonds 
we estimate the fair value for each revenue bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of our revenue bonds will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in their estimated fair values 
for example  we estimate  using the same methodology used to estimate the portfolio fair market value under fas  that a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would decrease the estimated fair value of our portfolio of revenue bonds from its december  value of approximately  to approximately  a decline in interest rates would increase the value of the december  portfolio to approximately  changes in the estimated fair value of the revenue bonds do not impact our reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other accumulated comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity 
changes in interest rates would also affect the pwf acquisition loan with fleet  the pwf warehouse lines and the related acquisition facility 
a change in the underlying interest rates would affect our annual net income by approximately  based on the outstanding balances at december  of approximately million for the pwf acquisition loan  million for the pwf warehouse line and million for the related acquisition facility 
the assumptions related to the foregoing discussion of market risk involve judgments involving future economic market conditions  future corporate decisions and other interrelating factors  many of which are beyond our control and all of which are difficult or impossible to predict with accuracy 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward looking information are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information included herein will prove to be accurate 
due to the significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking information  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as our representation that our objectives and plans would be achieved 
liquidity risk our investments generally lack a regular trading market  particularly during turbulent market conditions or if any of our tax exempt revenue bonds become taxable or are in default 
there is no limitation as to the percentage of investments that may be illiquid and we do not expect to invest a substantial portion of its assets in liquid investments 
there is a risk involved in investing in illiquid investments  particularly in the event that we need additional cash 
in a situation requiring additional cash  we could be forced to liquidate some of its investments on unfavorable terms that could substantially impact our consolidated balance sheet and reduce the amount of distributions available and payments made in respect of our shares 
risk associated with securitization through securitizations  we seek to enhance our overall return on our investments and to generate proceeds that  along with equity offering proceeds  facilitate the acquisition of additional investments 
in our debt securitizations  an investment bank and or credit enhancer generally provides liquidity to the underlying trust and credit enhancement to the bonds  which enables the senior interests to be sold to certain accredited third party investors seeking investments rated aa or better 
the liquidity facilities are generally for one year terms and are renewable annually 
to the extent that the credit enhancer is downgraded below aa  either an alternative credit enhancement provider would be substituted to reinstate the desired investment rating or the senior interests would be marketed to other accredited investors 
in either case  it is anticipated that the return on the residual interests would decrease  which would negatively impact our income 
if we are unable to renew the liquidity or credit enhancement facilities  we would be forced to find alternative liquidity or credit enhancement facilities  repurchase the underlying bonds or liquidate the underlying bonds and its investment in the residual interests 
if we are forced to liquidate our investment  we would recognize gains or losses on the liquidation  which may be significant depending on market conditions 
as of december   million of senior interest is credit enhanced by an eight year term facility through mbia 
of this million  million is subject to annual rollover renewal for liquidity 
merrill lynch provides credit enhancement and liquidity for an additional million of senior interest 
we do not maintain an ongoing commitment with merrill lynch and the senior interest is subject to a weekly re set schedule 
we continue to review alternatives that would reduce and diversify risks associated with securitization
