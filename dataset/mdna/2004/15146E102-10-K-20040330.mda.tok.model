competition the banking business in our present and intended future market areas is highly competitive with respect to virtually all products and services and has become increasingly so in recent years 
while the banking market in the our primary market area is generally dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area  our direct competitors in our niche market tend to be relatively smaller community banks  which also focus their businesses on korean american consumers and businesses 
there is a high level of competition within this specific market 
in the greater los angeles metropolitan area  our main competitors include seven locally owned and operated korean american banks and subsidiaries of two korean banks 
these other banks have branches located in many of the same neighborhoods as we do  provide similar types of products and services and use the same korean language publications and media for their marketing purposes 
a less significant source of competition in the los angeles metropolitan area are a small number of branches of major banks which maintain a limited bilingual staff for korean speaking customers 
while such banks have not traditionally focused their marketing efforts on our customer base in southern california  their competitive influence could increase should they in the future choose to focus on this market 
in phoenix and in las vegas  there are currently no local korean american banks serving the banking needs of the local korean american community 
seattle  denver and washington  dc each have one local bank focused on serving the banking needs of the local korean american community 
however  in the seattle area  three other los angeles based korean american banks have also opened lpos  and in washington d 
c 
and its vicinity  there is also one branch office of new york based subsidiary of one korean bank  which serves the banking needs of the local korean american community 
large commercial bank competitors have  among other advantages  the ability to finance wide ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment resources to areas of highest yield and demand 
many of the major banks operating in our market area offer certain services  which the bank does not offer directly but some of which we offer through correspondent institutions 
by virtue of their greater total capitalization  such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do 
in addition to other banks  competitors include savings institutions  credit unions  and numerous non banking institutions  such as finance companies  leasing companies  insurance companies  brokerage firms  and investment banking firms 
in recent years  increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non finance companies that offer money market and mutual funds  wholesale finance  credit card  and other consumer finance services  including on line banking services and personal finance software 
strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers 
to the extent that we are affected by more general competitive trends in the industry  those trends are towards increased consolidation and competition 
strong  unregulated competitors have entered banking markets with focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments 
many largely unregulated competitors are able to compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all significant products 
mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations  reduce expenses  and increase revenues to remain competitive 
competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws  which permit banking organizations to expand geographically  and the california market has been 
table of contents particularly attractive to out of state institutions the financial modernization act effective march   which has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial companies  has also intensified competitive conditions 
see supervision and regulation financial modernization act below 
technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in the financial services industry 
such innovations have  for example  made it possible for non depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously have been considered traditional banking products 
in addition  many customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels  including telephone  mail  home computer  atm s  self service branches and or in store branches 
in addition to other banks  the sources of competition for such hi tech products include savings associations  credit unions  brokerage firms  money market and other mutual funds  asset management groups  finance and insurance companies  and mortgage banking firms 
in order to compete with the other financial services providers  we provide quality  personalized  friendly service and fast decision making to better serve our customers needs 
for customers whose loan demands exceed our lending limit  we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with our correspondent banks 
we also distinguish ourselves within the korean ethnic community by expanding into geographic markets  which our competitors have not reached 
we also maintain an international trade finance department to meet the growing needs of the business communities within our niche market 
in order to compete on the technological front  we offer internet banking services to allow our customers to access their loan and deposit accounts through the internet 
customers can obtain transaction history  account information  transfer funds between accounts and process bill payments 
the market for the origination of sba loans is highly competitive 
with respect to its origination of sba loans  we compete with other small  mid size and major banks in the geographic areas in which our full service branches are located 
we currently have loan production offices  which emphasize sba loans 
in addition  because these loans are largely broker driven  we also compete with banks located outside of our immediate geographic area 
being designated a preferred sba lender with the full loan approval authority on behalf of the sba  our lpo s are able to provide a faster response to loan requests than competitors  which are not preferred sba lenders 
in order to compete in this highly competitive market  we place great emphasis on making sba loans to minority owned businesses 
unlike the market for the origination of sba loans  the secondary market for sba loans is currently a seller s market 
to date  we have had no difficulty in the resale of sba loans within the secondary market 
however  there is no assurance that this condition would continue to last or that the secondary market for sba loans will be available in the future 
employees as of december   we had full time equivalent employees 
none of our employees is concurrently represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
supervision and regulation both federal and state law extensively regulates bank holding companies 
this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of shareholders of center financial 
the following is a summary of particular statutes and regulations affecting center financial and center bank 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by the statutes and regulations 

table of contents regulation of center financial corporation center financial is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of section of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  which requires us to file annual  quarterly and other current reports with the sec 
we are also subject to additional regulations including  but not limited to  the proxy and tender offer rules promulgated by the sec under sections and of the exchange act  the reporting requirements of directors  executive officers and principal shareholders regarding transactions in our common stock and short swing profits rules promulgated by the sec under section of the exchange act  and certain additional reporting requirements by our principal shareholders promulgated by the sec under section of the exchange act 
center financial is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of and is registered as such with the federal reserve board 
a bank holding company is required to file with the federal reserve board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries 
it is also subject to examination by the federal reserve board and is required to obtain federal reserve board approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if  after such acquisition  it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank 
the federal reserve board has determined by regulation certain activities in which a bank holding company may or may not conduct business 
a bank holding company must engage  with certain exceptions  in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks 
the permissible activities and affiliations of certain bank holding companies have recently been expanded 
see financial modernization act below 
center financial and the bank are deemed to be affiliates of each other within the meaning set forth in the federal reserve act and are subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
this means  for example  that there are limitations on loans by the bank to affiliates  and that all affiliate transactions must satisfy certain limitations and otherwise be on terms and conditions at least as favorable to the bank as would be available for non affiliates 
the federal reserve board has a policy that bank holding companies must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks 
it is the federal reserve bank s position that bank holding companies should stand ready to use their available resources to provide adequate capital to their subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
bank holding companies should also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting their subsidiary banks 
the federal reserve board also has the authority to regulate bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest rate ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  the federal reserve board may require us to file written notice and obtain its approval prior to purchasing or redeeming our equity securities  unless certain conditions are met 
center financial is a financial holding company 
unlike a bank holding company  a financial holding company may engage in a broad range of activities that are deemed by the federal reserve board as financial in nature or incidental to financial activities 
moreover  even in the case where an activity cannot meet that test  the federal reserve board may approve the activity if the proposed activity is complementary to financial activities and does not pose a risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions 
one example of such activities  which would be allowed for a financial holding company but not for a bank or a simple bank holding company  is real estate development activities 
at the present time  center financial has no specific plans to engage in real estate development or any other activities  which would require financial holding company status 
regulation of center bank as a california state chartered bank whose accounts are insured by the fdic up to a maximum of  per depositor  we are subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the department of financial 
table of contents institutions and the fdic 
in addition  while we are not a member of the federal reserve system  we are subject to certain regulations of the federal reserve board 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of our business  including the making of periodic reports  and activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  branching  mergers and acquisitions  reserves against deposits and numerous other areas 
supervision  legal action and examination by the fdic is generally intended to protect depositors and is not intended for the protection of shareholders 
the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rate paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
capital adequacy requirements center financial and center bank are subject to the regulations of the federal reserve board and the fdic  respectively  governing capital adequacy 
those regulations incorporate both risk based and leverage capital requirements 
each of the federal regulators has established risk based and leverage capital guidelines for the banks or bank holding companies it regulates  which set total capital requirements and define capital in terms of core capital elements  or tier capital  and supplemental capital elements  or tier capital 
tier capital is generally defined as the sum of the core capital elements less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair market value 
the following items are defined as core capital elements i common shareholders equity  ii qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and iii minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
supplementary capital elements include i allowance for loan and lease losses but not more than of an institution s risk weighted assets  ii perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital  iii hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments  and iv term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock and related surplus 
the maximum amount of supplemental capital elements  which qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the minimum required ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets is total risk based capital ratio  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and the minimum required ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets is tier risk based capital ratio 
risk based capital ratios are calculated to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the statements of financial condition as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under the risk based capital guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain u 
s 
treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
the risk based capital requirements also take into account concentrations of credit ie  relatively large proportions of loans involving one borrower  industry  location  collateral or loan type and the risks of non traditional activities those that have not customarily been part of the banking business 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards  and authorize the regulators to review an institution s management of such risks in assessing an institution s capital adequacy 

table of contents the risk based capital regulations also include exposure to interest rate risk as a factor that the regulators will consider in evaluating a bank s or bank holding company s capital adequacy 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
while interest rate risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the bank or bank holding company 
the fdic and the federal reserve board also require the maintenance of a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate such institutions and are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets leverage capital ratio of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banking institutions must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans  and federal regulators may set  however  higher capital requirements when an institution s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december   all center financial s regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory minimums 
see table below of the company s tier capital at december   million  or approximately  consisted of trust preferred securities 
however  no assurance can be given that the trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as tier capital in the future 
the following table compares the company s and the bank s actual capital ratios at december  and  to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes risk based ratios center financial corporation center bank center financial corporation center bank total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have defined by regulation the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
as of december  and  center bank was deemed well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration 
table of contents plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  insured banks are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in addition  banks must pay an amount  which fluctuates but is currently cents per of insured deposits  towards the retirement of the financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
community reinvestment act center bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving community reinvestment act cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting 
table of contents its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on the bank s actual lending service and investment performance  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
center bank was last examined for cra compliance in and received a satisfactory cra assessment rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
examination and enforcement has become intense  and banks have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
in addition to cra and fair lending requirements  center bank is subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  center bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be consummated by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or percent or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in  california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act discussed above and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate the changes effected by interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which center bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter center bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to the accelerated consolidation of the banking industry 
while many large out of state banks have already entered the california market as a result of this legislation  it is not possible to predict the precise impact of this legislation on center bank and center financial and the competitive environment in which they operate 

table of contents financial modernization act effective march   the gramm leach bliley act eliminated most barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  and enabled full affiliations to occur between such entities 
this legislation permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby acquire securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdicia prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed  and has at least a satisfactory rating under the cra by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve board 
center financial is a financial holding company  in order to take advantage  if appropriate  of the increased flexibility provided by the gramm leach bliley act 
however  center financial has no specific plans at this time with respect to any activities it may conduct because of this increased flexibility 
the gramm leach bliley act defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the board has determined to be closely related to banking 
a national bank and therefore  a state bank as well may also engage  subject to limitations on investment  in activities that are financial in nature  other than insurance underwriting  insurance company portfolio investment  real estate development and real estate investment  through a financial subsidiary of the bank  if the bank is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must continue to be well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions  which could include divestiture of the financial in nature subsidiary or subsidiaries 
in addition  a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
the gramm leach bliley act also imposes significant requirements on financial institutions with respect to the privacy of customer information  and modifies other existing laws  including those related to community reinvestment 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of the patriot act 
enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   the patriot act is intended to strengthen us law enforcement s and the intelligence communities ability to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the potential impact of the act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations applicable to financial institutions  including due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private banks accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with treasury department s financial crimes enforcement network for transactions exceeding  and the filing of suspicious activities report securities by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating us laws and regulations

we also implemented new systems and procedures to identify suspicious activity reports and report to fincen 
the cost of additional staff in the bsa compliance department and the system enhancement described above was reflected in the statements of operations for the years ended december   and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of soa was enacted to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
the soa generally applies to all companies  both us and us  that file or are required to file periodic reports under the securities exchange act of  including the company 
the soa includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules  requires the sec and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules and mandates further studies of specified issues by the securities and exchange commission and the comptroller general 
the soa represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
the soa contains provisions  which became effective upon enactment on july  and provisions  which became effective from within days to one year from enactment 
the securities and exchange commission has promulgated regulations to implement various provisions of the soa  including additional disclosure requirements in periodic filings under the exchange act 
the company has revised its internal policies and exchange act disclosures to comply with these new requirements 
other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives  which could affect center financial  center bank and the banking industry  in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced  before the united states congress  the california legislature and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject center bank and center financial to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of center financial or center bank would be affected thereby 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report before making investment decisions concerning our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks 
poor economic conditions in california may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans 
a substantial majority of our loans are generated in the greater los angeles area in southern california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in the los angeles area may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the los angeles area has experienced a downturn in economic activity in line with the slowdown in california during the past year 
economic growth slowed significantly as a result continuation of recessionary conditions and brush fires  which has taken place throughout southern california  although delinquencies on our loans as a result of the current conditions have been minimal 
high unemployment levels experienced since mid continued in  especially in los angeles county  which is our geographic center and the base of our deposit and lending activity 
in addition  it is likely that the continued us presence in iraq will continue to have a significant negative effect on the national economy 
if the current recessionary conditions continue or deteriorate  we expect that our level of problem assets would increase accordingly  resulting in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for us 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject us to increased risks in the event of a real estate recession or natural disaster 
approximately million or of our loan portfolio as of december   and million or of our loan portfolio as of december   were concentrated in commercial real estate loans 
of this amount  million represented loans secured by industrial buildings  and million represented loans secured by retail shopping centers as of december  although commercial loans generally provide for higher interest rates and shorter terms than single family residential loans  such loans generally involve a higher degree of risk  as the ability of borrowers to repay these loans is often dependent upon the profitability of the borrowers businesses 
an increase in the percentage of nonperforming assets in commercial real estate  commercial and industrial loan portfolios may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations  by reducing our income  increasing our expenses  and leaving us with less cash available for lending and other activities 
as the primary collateral for many of our loans rests on commercial real estate properties  a downturn in real estate values in the greater southern california region could negatively impact us by providing us with decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
in the early s  the entire state of california experienced an economic recession  particularly impacting real estate values that resulted in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for many of the state s financial institutions 
if any similar real estate recession affecting our market areas should occur in the future  the security for many of our loans could be reduced and the ability of many of our borrowers to pay could decline 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural disaster like those california has experienced in the past  including earthquakes  brush fires  and  during early  flooding attributed to the weather phenomenon known as el ni o  could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans and negatively impact our results of operations 
we have not experienced any deterioration in our commercial real estate loan portfolio 
however  there was an increase in delinquencies among construction loans  due to one construction loan 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition nonperforming assets 

table of contents we may experience loan losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that are beyond our control may cause our actual loan losses to exceed current allowance estimates 
if the actual loan losses exceed the allowance for loan losses  it will hurt our business 
in addition  the fdic and the department of financial institutions  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the department of financial institutions could also hurt our business 
we try to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans 
losses nevertheless occur 
we establish loan loss allowances for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statements of financial condition date 
we base these allowances on estimates of the following industry standards  historical loss experience  evaluation of current economic conditions  assessment of risk factors for loans with exposure to the economies of south korea and other pacific rim countries  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
our total assets have increased to billion as of december   from million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company has achieved compounded annual growth rate of in total assets since we opened one new branch office in september  five additional branches in the second half of  one in and one in we have also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the branch operations of korea exchange bank in chicago  illinois with an anticipated closing date of april   and are in the process of negotiating the purchase of liberty bank in new york see recent developments 
we intend to investigate other opportunities to open additional branches that would complement our existing business as such opportunities may arise  however  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify additional locations or finalize additional branch openings 
our ability to manage our growth will depend primarily on our ability to monitor operations  control costs  maintain positive customer relations  and attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to achieve those objectives in an efficient and timely manner  we may experience interruptions and dislocations in our business which could substantially increase our expenses and negatively impact our ability to retain our customers 
in addition  such concerns may cause federal and state banking regulators to require us to delay or forgo any proposed growth until such problems have been addressed to the satisfaction of those regulators 
we have found that growth by de novo branch banking in has temporarily increased our overhead expenses as a percentage of our total assets 
the overall effect of opening five new branches in was that our 
table of contents earnings were reduced because of these increased costs 
if we continue to open additional branches  we expect to face similar increased costs in the future 
our earnings are subject to interest rate risk  especially if rates fall 
banking companies earnings depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board  the international interest rate environment  as well as by economic  regulatory and competitive factors which influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of nonperforming assets 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for our products and services 
we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread could be expected to increase during times of rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during times of falling interest rates 
therefore  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse or a positive effect on our results of operations 
see item a  quantitive and qualitative disclosure of market risks interest rate risk 
all of our lending involves underwriting risks  especially in a competitive lending market 
at december   commercial real estate loans represented of our total loan portfolio  commercial lines and term loans to businesses represented of our total loan portfolio  and sba loans represented of our total loan portfolio 
real estate lending involves risks associated with the potential decline in the value of underlying real estate collateral and the cash flow from income producing properties 
declines in real estate values and cash flows can be caused by a number of factors  including adversity in general economic conditions  rising interest rates  changes in tax and other governmental and other policies affecting real estate holdings  environmental conditions  governmental and other use restrictions  development of competitive properties  and increasing vacancy rates 
our dependence increases the risk of loss both in our loan portfolio and with respect to any other real estate owned when real estate values decline 
we seek to reduce our risk of loss through our underwriting and monitoring procedures 
commercial lending  even when secured by the assets of a business  involves considerable risk of loss in the event of failure of the business 
to reduce such risk  we typically take additional security interests in other collateral  such as real property  certificates of deposit or life insurance  and or obtain personal guarantees 
specific risks associated with sba lending are discussed in a separate risk factor below 
we operate in a highly competitive market  and some of our competitors offer a broader range of services than we provide  and have lower cost structures 
the banking business in our current and intended future market areas is highly competitive with respect to virtually all products and services 
while the banking market in our primary market area is generally dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area  our main competitors include seven locally owned and operated korean american banks and subsidiaries of two korean banks 
these other banks have branches located in many of the same neighborhoods as we do  provide similar types of products and services and use the same korean language publications and media for their marketing purposes 
there is a high level of competition within this specific market 
while major banks have not historically focused their marketing efforts on the bank s korean american customer base in southern 
table of contents california  their competitive influence could increase in the future 
such banks have substantially greater lending limits than we have  offer certain services we cannot  and often operate with economies of scale that result in lower operating costs than ours on a per loan or per asset basis 
in addition to competitive factors impacting our specific market niche  we are affected by more general competitive trends in the banking industry  including intra state and interstate consolidation  competition from non bank sources and technological innovations 
many of our competitors have advantages over us in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 
we also compete with other financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  thrift and loan companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage companies and insurance companies located within and without our service area and with quasi financial institutions such as money market funds for deposits and loans 
financial services like ours are increasingly offered over the internet on a national and international basis  and we compete with providers of these services as well 
ultimately  competition can drive down our interest margins and reduce our profitability 
it also can make it more difficult for us to continue to increase the size of our loan portfolio and deposit base

trading in our common stock has not been extensive and you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future 
although center financial s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market since october  the day after the effective date of the holding company reorganization  trading in our stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as active 
see item  market for common equity and related shareholder matters trading history 
we might not be able to continue to pay cash dividends in the future 
as a banking holding company which currently has no significant assets other than our equity interest in center bank  our ability to pay dividends primarily depends upon the dividends we receive from center bank 
the dividend practice of center bank  like our dividend practice  will depend upon its earnings  financial position  current and anticipated cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by center bank s board of directors at that time 
in addition  during any period in which center financial has deferred payment of interest otherwise due and payable on its subordinated debt securities  we may not make any dividends or distributions with respect to our capital stock 
see item  business recent developments and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
we paid a cash dividend of cents per share in february and in october and currently plan to continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  the amount of any such dividend will be determined each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion  based on the factors described in the previous paragraph 
no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future performance will justify the payment of dividends in any particular quarter 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries 
substantially all of our revenue and cash flow  including funds available for the payment of dividends and other operating expenses  is dependent upon the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries 
dividends payable to us by center bank are restricted under california and federal laws and regulation 
see item  market for common equity and related shareholder matters dividends 
we have specific risks associated with small business administration loans 
we realized million  million  and  respectively  in and in and  in gains recognized on secondary market sales of our sba loans 
we have regularly sold the guaranteed portions of these loans in the secondary market 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans  or that a secondary market will exist for  or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of  the guaranteed portions of the sba loans 
the federal government presently guarantees to of the principal 
table of contents amount of each qualifying sba loan 
we can provide no assurance that the federal government will maintain the sba program  or if it does  that such guaranteed portion will remain at its current funding level 
furthermore  we can provide no assurance that we will retain our preferred lender status  which  subject to certain limitations  allows us to approve and fund sba loans without the necessity of having the loan approved in advance by the sba  or that if it does  the federal government will not reduce the amount of such loans which we can make 
we believe that our sba loan portfolio does not involve more than a normal risk of collectibility 
however  since we have sold some of the guaranteed portions of our sba loan portfolio  we incur a pro rata credit risk on the non guaranteed portion of the sba loans since we share pro rata with the sba in any recoveries 
in the event of default on an sba loan  our pursuit of remedies against a borrower would be subject to sba approval  and where the sba establishes that its loss is attributable to deficiencies in the manner in which the loan application has been prepared and submitted  the sba may decline to honor its guarantee with respect to our sba loans or it may seek the recovery of damages from us 
the sba has never declined to honor its guarantees with respect to its sba loans  although no assurance can be given that the sba would not attempt to do so in the future

another economic downturn in south korea could cause us to incur losses with respect to certain of our loans and credit transactions which expose us to the korean economy 
because a significant portion of our customer base is korean american  we have historically had exposure to the korean economy with respect to certain of our loans and credit transactions 
we make three types of credit extensions involving direct exposure to the korean economy commercial loans to us affiliates subsidiaries branches of companies located in south korea korean affiliate loans  acceptances with korean banks  and standby letters of credit issued by korean banks 
we also have indirect exposure to the economies of various pacific rim countries because we provide short term trade financing to local import and or export businesses in connection with issuing letters of credit to overseas suppliers sellers  as well as making working capital and other business loans to such businesses  some of which businesses could be hurt by a downturn in the economies of such countries 
the korean economy and its capital markets suffered significant downturns in late and early  and we had one korean affiliate loan for million that had to be charged off in because such customer was directly impacted by the problems in south korea 
since that time the bank had recovered million of this amount as of december  this one charge off in represented in excess of of our total charge offs in see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition nonperforming assets  allowance for loan losses and market risk interest rate risk management 
since that time  we have been closely monitoring our exposure to the korean economy and those of other pacific rim countries and have taken steps to reduce our exposure and to make sure that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses that might occur if problems were to arise again in south korea or those other countries 
however  another severe downturn in the korean economy or in the economies of other pacific rim countries could cause us to incur significant credit losses 
our directors and executive officers control a large amount of our stock  and your interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of march   our directors  executive officers and nominees for director together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they would be able to significantly affect the election of directors as well as the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  such as the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
such concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of center financial 
in some situations  the interests of our directors and executive officers may be different from yours 
however  our board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 

table of contents provisions in our articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of our corporation or our management 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire us  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the price that you receive if you sell your shares in the future 
these provisions include the following a requirement that certain business combinations not approved by our board of directors receive the approval of two thirds of the outstanding shares  staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and a requirement that our board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on the our employees  depositors  customers and the communities we serve as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of center financial 
we are involved in litigation 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation 
if litigation arises against us  we will vigorously enforce and defend our rights 
however  some litigation may result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management personnel from their day to day responsibilities 
in the event of an adverse result in litigation  we could also be required to pay substantial damages 
we are currently a party to a lawsuit entitled korea export insurance corporation v 
korea data systems usa  inc  et al 
we expect to incur substantial legal fees and expenses in connection with this lawsuit 
as a result  our defense of this lawsuit  regardless of its eventual outcome  will likely be costly and time consuming 
we have insurance against certain types of claims  and while it is possible that a portion of this claim may ultimately be covered  this determination cannot be made until after the final disposition of the case 
if the outcome of this litigation is adverse to us and we are required to pay significant monetary damages  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected

item legal proceedings from time to time  we are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
with the exception of the potentially adverse outcome in the litigation described in the next two paragraphs  after taking into consideration information furnished by our counsel as to the current status of these claims and proceedings  we do not believe that the aggregate potential liability resulting from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
on or about march   we were served with a complaint filed by korea export insurance corporation keic in orange county  california superior court  entitled korea export insurance corporation v 
korea data systems usa  inc  et al 
keic is seeking to recover alleged losses from a number of parties involved in international trade transactions that gave rise to bills of exchange financed by various korean banks but not ultimately paid 
keic is seeking to recover damages of approximately million from us based on a claim that we  in our capacity as a collecting bank for these bills of exchange  acted negligently in presenting and otherwise handling trade documents for collection 
initially  we moved to dismiss keic s claims based on the pleadings 
our motion to dismiss was not granted  and we have answered keic s complaint denying liability 
we have also asserted claims against various other parties seeking indemnification to the extent we may be found liable  and also seeking damages 
two of the parties against whom we have made claims have made tort liability and indemnification claims against us and other parties in the case 
none of the claims against us or the other parties has yet been adjudicated  and the litigation is only in the preliminary stages 
we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit 
we believe we have meritorious defenses against the claims made by keic and the party alleged to have accepted bills of exchange 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation  and it will be expensive and time consuming to defend 
while it is possible that a portion of the claims may ultimately be covered by insurance  it is unlikely that this determination can be made until after the final disposition of the case 
if the outcome of this litigation is adverse to us  and we are required to pay significant monetary damages  our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be materially and adversely affected

table of contents the dividend practice of center bank  like our dividend practice  will depend upon its earnings  financial position  current and anticipated cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by center bank s board of directors at that time 
in addition  during any period in which it has deferred payment of interest otherwise due and payable on its subordinated debt securities  center financial may not make any dividends or distributions with respect to its capital stock 
see item  business recent developments and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
beginning in october center financial commenced a new dividend policy of paying quarterly cash dividends to its shareholders 
in accordance with this policy  the company paid a cash dividend of cents per share in october and again in february the company plans to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future  provided that such dividends allow the company to continue to meet regulatory capital requirements and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
prior to october  the company had been reinvesting its earnings into its capital in order to support the company s continuous growth through the payment of stock rather than cash dividends 
in addition  in january  the company declared a two for one stock split of its common stock 
as a result  each shareholder of record as of february  received one additional share of common stock for each share they held on that date  and the company s outstanding shares doubled to  center bank s ability to pay cash dividends to us is also subject to certain legal limitations 
under california law  banks may declare a cash dividend out of their net profits up to the lesser of retained earnings or the net income for the last three fiscal years less any distributions made to shareholders during such period  or with the prior written approval of the commissioner of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i the retained earnings of the bank  ii the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or iii the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
in addition  under federal law  banks are prohibited from paying any dividends if after making such payment they would fail to meet any of the minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the federal regulators also have the authority to prohibit banks from engaging in any business practices which are considered to be unsafe or unsound  and in some circumstances the regulators might prohibit the payment of dividends on that basis even though such payments would otherwise be permissible 
our ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law allows us to pay dividends to our shareholders if our retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed dividend 
if we do not have sufficient retained earnings available for the proposed dividend  we may still pay a dividend to our shareholders if we meet two conditions after giving effect to the dividend 
those conditions are generally are as follows i our assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would equal at least times our liabilities  and ii our current assets would equal at least our current liabilities or  if the average of our earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of our interest expense for such fiscal years  then our current assets must equal at least times our current liabilities

information for is for the company on a consolidated basis unless otherwise stated 

table of contents critical accounting policy the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments and have the greatest potential impact on the company s results of operation 
management has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan loss methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets  including economic conditions in southern california  south korea and other pacific rim countries  and in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to lending officers background and experience levels  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
as the company adds new products  increases the complexity of its loan portfolio  and expands its geographic coverage  it will enhance its methodologies to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
management might report a materially different amount for the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations to change the allowance for loan losses if its assessment of the above factors were different 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein  as well as the portion of this management s discussion and analysis section entitled financial condition allowance for loan losses 
although management believes the level of the allowance as of december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in the local economy may result in increasing losses that cannot reasonably be predicted at this time 
we generally cease to accrue interest on any loan with respect to which the loan s contractual payments are more than days delinquent 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan for which management has determined that collection of our investment in the loan is not reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms for a period  minimum six months  and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be allocated 
properties acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure  are transferred to the other real estate owned portfolio and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value includes revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  construction and renovation costs 
certain small business administration sba loans that we have the intent to sell prior to maturity are designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
a portion of the premium on sale of sba loans is recognized as other operating income at the time of the sale 
the remaining portion of the premium relating to the portion of the loan retained is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield 
servicing assets are recognized when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing costs  over the estimated 
table of contents life of the loan  using a discount rate based on the related note rate plus 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated future servicing income 
management periodically evaluates the servicing asset for impairment  which is the carrying amount of the servicing asset in excess of the related fair value 
impairment  if it occurs  is recognized in a write down or charge off in the period of impairment 
as part of our asset and liability management strategy  we have entered into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
the objective for the interest rate swaps is to manage asset and liability positions in connection with our strategy of minimizing the interest rate fluctuations on interest rate margin and equity 
the interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  and are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we receive from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income oci  net of tax  and reclassified into interest income as such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges is recorded as a gain or loss directly to the consolidated statement of earnings as a part of non interest income 
currently  fair value of the interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the discount rate that was adjusted by the yield curve 
in accordance with sfas no 
 securities are classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
securities in the held to maturity category consist of securities purchased for long term investment in order to enhance our ongoing stream of net interest income 
securities deemed held to maturity are classified as such because we have both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost 
accreted discounts and amortized premiums on securities are included in interest income using the interest method  and unrealized and realized gains or losses related to the holding or selling of securities are calculated using the specific identification method 
all other securities are classified as available for sale with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses executive overview continuation of strong and healthy growth in provided momentum for another year of record earnings in consolidated net income for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in all per share figures have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split effective february  the company s improvement in earnings compared to the same period in represents an increase of 
the following were significant factors related to results as compared to expanding into different geographic areas where growing korean population are located continues to be an important part of our long term strategy for growth

we are also in the process of expanding our branch operations outside the state of california see item business recent developments 
our net interest margin declined by basis points in compared to the average market rate decrease of basis points 
in  we managed to limit the decrease in our interest margin to only points  due to the following a low interest earning assets were replaced by higher yielding loans b the timing differences created by immediate repricing of variable rate loans versus a large base of deposits  which are generally slower to reprice 
c income generated from interest rate swaps of million 
table of contents the effects of the decline in our net interest margin were offset by asset growth  increased non interest income and good expense control 
noninterest income showed growth of million compared with due to greater than two fold increases in sba loan sales and higher fees charged on customer deposit accounts 
new fee income generating products such as the mortgage referral program and atm funding program also helped to boost noninterest income 
we invested million in bank owned life insurance boli in december  and increased our investment in affordable housing partnerships by  to million from million to enhance profitability

the deposits with state of california increased by million in our financial condition and liquidity remain strong 
the following are important factors in understanding our financial condition and liquidity under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we continue to be well capitalized  on december   center capital trust i  a newly formed delaware statutory business trust and a wholly owned deconsolidated subsidiary of the company the trust  issued an aggregate of million of principal amount of trust preferred securities  the company declared its first quarterly cash dividend of per share to the shareholders paid on october   all liquidity measures at december  met or exceeded the same measures at december  results of operations net interest income the company s earnings depend largely upon its net interest income  which is the difference between the income received from its loan portfolio and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on its deposits and other liabilities 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the level and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
the company s net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  governmental budgetary matters and the actions of the federal reserve board 
interest rates on deposits are affected primarily by rates charged by competitors 
net interest income was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income of million  or  in was principally due to increases in average loans by million and in average taxable securities by million

table of contents due to a reduction of basis point in market rates set by federal reserve board and high prepayments of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
in later part of  management used the proceeds of investment securities due to prepayments to finance higher yielding loans 
as a result  the net interest margin improved to in fourth quarter from in the fourth quarter 
in addition  since the yield on earning assets reacted more instantaneously to the downward trend in interest rates  the lag in the repricing of the company s considerable time deposit portfolio has resulted in a contraction of the company s net interest margin 
during  the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to or basis points from in  as a result of the basis points decline in interest rates in the prime rate  to which the majority of the company s loans are tied  is at its lowest rate in several decades 
this decrease in yield was mainly due to a basis point decrease in taxable investment securities  which decreased to in from in high prepayments recorded on mortgage backed and collateralized mortgage obligations due to the low rate environment were the major contributors to the decrease 
similarly  the company s overall cost of funds decreased to or basis points at december  from in the cost of funds did not decrease as much as the decrease in yield on earning assets  because of the lag in the repricing to a lesser degree of the interest rates on the company s substantial portfolio of time deposits 
however  the increase of million to million in noninterest bearing demand deposits in from million in  on which the company relied on as a considerable funding source  partially offset the decrease in net interest margin during these decreases were partially offset by an increase average cost of savings deposits 
the average cost of savings deposits for the twelve months of increased basis points to as compared to for the same period in  mainly due to volume increases in higher rate installment savings deposits  which are used as a marketing tool to attract new customers at the newly opened branches 
comparing to  the company s net interest margin decreased basis points to from 
the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily driven by the basis points decrease in the market rate set by the federal reserve board in november during  the overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points to from in  while cost of funds decreased basis points to from in

even though they are funded mostly with interest bearing liabilities  these three types of investments are not classified as an interest earning asset 
the company invested million in the atm funding program launched during the third quarter of  million in boli in december  and increased its investment in affordable housing partnerships by  to million at december  from million in provision for loan losses for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively

table of contents on previously charged off loans  combined with a decrease in the level of new charge offs the company had net recoveries of  in as compared to net charge offs of  in the high volume of recoveries in coupled with continued strong performance of the loan portfolio  enabled bank s management to keep the provision for loan losses at constant level in  in spite of a increase in the average loan volume 
while management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are included below under allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income increased or million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december   but decreased slightly as a percentage of average earning assets 
the primary sources of recurring noninterest income continue to be customer service fee charges on deposit accounts  fees from trade finance transactions and gain on sale of sba loans 
customer service fees increased by million  or from to  and by million  or from to fee increases implemented on customer deposit accounts and the higher number of account relationships from new branches  were the main contributors for the customer service fee income increase in however  customer service fees decreased as a percentage of noninterest income to for  compared to and in and  respectively 
however  the decrease in this percentage in resulted primarily from unusually high gains on sale of loans and fixed assets in excluding gains on sale of loans and fixed assets  the ratios of customer service fees to total noninterest income actually increased to in despite the continuing declining trend  fee income from trade finance transactions still remained the second largest source of our noninterest income 
fee income from trade finance transactions were million  million and million in  and  respectively  due to constant levels of international trade activity by the company s customers in the periods under review 
fee income from trade finance transactions as a percentage of total noninterest income also continued to decline in to  as compared to and  respectively  in and since management s decision to sell sba loans on a regular basis  the gain on loan sales more than doubled to million in  as compared to million in the company sold million sba loans during as compared to million during the gain on loan sales also increased by  in as compared to  mainly due to the increased volume of sba loan sales 
the company had a gain on the sale of fixed assets of  during  in which it sold one of its branch facilities in order to relocate the branch to a more desirable site  which did not apply in the same periods of and as a result of the increased volume of sba loan sales and retention of servicing rights during  other loan related service fees increased by  or to million during as compared to  during other loan related fees totaled  in  an increase of as compare with  in the new fee income generating products  including center bank s mortgage referral program and the atm funding program  helped to boost other income by  or to million in as compared to million in other income as a percentage of total noninterest income also increased to for from in the like period a year ago 
in addition  the company s investment of million in bank owned life insurance boli in december generated  of noninterest income for boli income  which is not taxable  is generated by the increase in the cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance policies net of the cost associated with mortality charges and certain consulting expenses 
management expects boli income to increase in  primarily due to the full year impact 
other income was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the twelve months of this increase was mainly due to 
table of contents prepayment penalty charges of  and certain recoveries of  the company recognized certain recoveries as a result of final settlement with the irs on reserve previously set aside for a tax lien claim  during the following table sets forth the various components of the company s noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income for the years ended december  amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total dollars in thousands customer service fees fee income from trade finance transactions wire transfer fees gain on sale of loans net gain on sale of securities available for sale gain on sale of fixed assets other loan related service fees other income total noninterest income as a percentage of average earning assets noninterest expense noninterest expense is comprised primarily of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture  fixture  and equipment  data processing  professional service fees  business promotions and advertising  and other operating expenses

the efficiency ratio  defined as the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and noninterest income  was for the year ended december   compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in the efficiency ratio in resulted primarily from the increase in operating efficiencies at the five new branches opened during because of the company s conservative approach of charging off  of unrealized losses related to floating rate government agency preferred stocks in december  efficiency ratio remained almost flat at in management expects the efficiency ratio to continue to improve in as it has in  because of greater operational efficiencies and increased profit contributions from the branches 
however  no assurance can be given that such improvement will in fact occur 
although the credit quality of the issuer of a floating rate agency preferred stock is not questioned  the interest rate environment has created an other than temporary decline in value of floating rate agency preferred stocks whose fair market value have been lower than its cost basis for over twelve months and therefore a  other than temporary decline in value charge was taken in december the largest dollar increase was in compensation and employee benefits  which increased by million or to million during compared to million in  but decreased from to as a percentage of total noninterest expense 
the increase was attributed to the additional year end performance incentives as well as normal increases in annual salary for existing employees 
compensation and employee benefits increased to million during compared to million in  but decreased from to as a percentage of total noninterest expense 
the increase was primarily due to full year s impact in 
table of contents from the expansion of the branch network  five offices opening during the second quarter of additionally  the impact of incentive compensation as well as normal increases in annual salary for existing employees  further contributed to the increase in compensation and employee benefits during occupancy expense increased by to million during  compared to million and million in years and respectively  but remained almost constant at the level as a percentage of total noninterest expense 
the primary reason for this increase in was the opening of the fullerton branch office and relocation of the western branch office 
furniture  fixture  and equipment expense increased by the  or  to million in compared to million and  in and  respectively 
however  the ratio of furniture  fixture  and equipment expense to total noninterest expense remained steady at about 
this increase was mainly due to additional depreciation expense associated with the opening of the fullerton branch office and relocation of western branch office 
because of the higher professional fees and increased expenses associated with ongoing legal cases  professional service fees increased by to million in as compared to million in  and to compared to of total noninterest expenses 
for the year ended december   professional service fees increased to million  compared to million in  and to compared to of total noninterest expenses 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the extraordinary legal and accounting fees related to the company s holding company formation  sec registration and listing on the nasdaq national market 
while non litigation related professional fees were actually lower in compared to because the fees were unusually high as noted above  such fees in were still significant  and reflected the ongoing costs of compliance with the many sec and nasdaq requirements  including compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of it is anticipated that such non litigation related legal and accounting costs will likely increase further in due to the implementation of additional provisions of the sarbanes oxley act as well as nasdaq s recently enacted corporate governance rules 
business promotion and advertising expense increased by to million in as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to our name change and increased promotions for new products and services such as our mortgage lending program and money smart program 
the company has participated in the money smart program by the federal deposit insurance corporation as it aims to educate people on banking services by translating the training material into korean 
business promotion and advertising expense increased by to million in as compared to million in the increase resulted from the company s greater emphasis on product promotion through increased marketing efforts and the loan referral program 
other operating expense also increased significantly 
other operating expense include court settlements  correspondent bank charge expense  regulatory assessment expense  loan related expense  director compensation expense  corporate administrative expense  and loss on investment in affordable housing partnerships  for which the company receives federal income tax credits and cra credits 
other operating expense in increased to million  compared to million in and from to as percentage of total noninterest expenses increase was primarily due to i settlements cost relating to long standing legal proceedings and ii  charge off in december related to unrealized losses on floating rate government agency preferred stocks 
there is no other significant legal case outstanding other than keic at december   see item  legal proceedings 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased to million  compared to million in  or from to as a percentage of total noninterest expenses  primarily due to increase in corporate administrative expense of  and  loss on investment in affordable housing partnerships 
all other noninterest expenses include stationery and supplies  telecommunications  postage  courier service and security service expenses

current tax expense is the result of applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
the deferred portion is intended to reflect that income on which taxes are paid differs from financial statement pre tax income because some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for income tax purposes than in the financial statements

the company s deferred tax asset was million as of december    and million as of december   and  respectively

to take the advantage of lower rates in the company has borrowed million from the federal home loan bank 
loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio represents the largest single portion of earning assets  substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset placement category 
the quality and diversification of the company s loan portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the company s results of operations 
the company offers a range of products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers 
the company s lending activities consist of commercial real estate lending  construction loans  commercial business and trade finance loans  and consumer loans

as of december   no single industry or business category represented more than of the loan portfolio

real estate lending involves risks associated with the potential decline in the value of the underlying real estate collateral and the cash flow from the income producing properties 
declines in real estate values and cash flows can be caused by a number of factors  including adversity in general economic conditions  rising interest rates  changes in tax and other governmental and other policies affecting real estate holdings  environmental conditions  governmental and other use restrictions  development of competitive properties  and increasing vacancy rates 
the company s dependence on real estate values increases the risk of loss both in the company s loan portfolio and with respect to any other real estate owned when real estate values decline 
the company offers commercial real estate loans secured by industrial buildings  retail stores  or office buildings  where the property s repayment source generally comes from tenants or businesses that fully or partially occupy the building 
when real estate collateral is owner occupied  the value of the real estate collateral must be supported by a formal appraisal in accordance with applicable regulations  subject to certain exceptions 
the majority of the properties securing these loans are located in los angeles and orange counties 
real estate commercial loans are loans secured by first deeds of trust on real estate 
consists of loans to us affiliates or branches of korean companies 
see loans involving country risk includes advances on trust receipts  clean advances  cash advances  acceptances discounted  and documentary negotiable advances under commitments

consists of transactions in process and overdrafts 

table of contents the company has established general underwriting guidelines for commercial property real estate loans requiring a maximum loan to value ltv ratio of 
the company s underwriting policies also generally require that the properties securing commercial real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios of at least for investor owned property 
additionally  for owner occupied properties  the company expects additional debt service capacity from the business itself 
as additional security  the company generally requires personal guarantees when commercial real estate loans are extended to corporations  limited partnerships  and other legal entities 
commercial real estate loans are in all cases secured by first deeds of trust  generally for terms extending no more than seven years  and are amortized over periods of up to years 
the majority of the commercial real estate loans currently being originated contain interest rates tied to the company s prime rate that adjusts with changes in the national prime rate 
the company also extends commercial real estate loans with fixed rates 
payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
repayment of such loans may therefore be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including limiting the size of such loans and strictly scrutinizing the properties securing the loans 
the company generally obtains loan guarantees from financially capable parties 
the company s lending personnel inspect substantially all of the properties collateralizing the company s real estate loans before such loans are made 
as of december   commercial real estate loans totaled million  representing of total loans  compared to million or of total loans at december  the increase in the percentage of commercial real estate loans resulted from management s efforts to promote this segment of the portfolio  as such loans involve a somewhat lesser degree of risk than certain other loans in the portfolio due to the nature and value of the collateral 
real estate construction loans 
the company finances the construction of various projects within the company s market area  including motels  industrial buildings  tax credit low income apartment complexes and single family residences 
the future condition of the local economy could negatively impact the collateral values of such loans 
the company s construction loans typically have the following characteristics i maturity of two years or less  ii a floating interest rate based on the company s prime rate  iii advance of anticipated interest cost during construction  iv advance of fees  v first lien position on the underlying real estate  vi loan to value ratio of  and vii recourse against the borrower or guarantor in the event of default 
the company does not participate in joint ventures or make equity investments in connection with its construction lending 
construction loans involve additional risks compared to loans secured by existing improved real property 
these risks include the following i the uncertain value of the project prior to completion  ii the inherent uncertainty in estimating construction costs  which is often beyond the control of the borrower  iii construction delays and cost overruns  and iv the difficulty in accurately evaluating the market value of the completed project 
as a result of these uncertainties  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than on the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of and accrued 
real estate construction loans totaled million or of total loans and million or of total loans at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in construction loans is primarily due to loan payoffs 

table of contents commercial business loans 
the company offers commercial loans for intermediate and short term credit 
commercial loans may be unsecured  partially secured or fully secured 
the majority of the originations of commercial loans are in los angeles county and orange county  in the state of california 
the company originates commercial business loans to facilitate term working capital and to finance business acquisitions  fixed asset purchases  accounts receivable and inventory financing 
these term loans to businesses generally have terms of up to five years  have interest rates tied to the company s prime rate  and may be secured in whole or in part by owner occupied real estate or time deposits at the company 
for a term loan  the company typically requires monthly payments of both principal and interests 
in addition  the company grants commercial lines of credit to finance accounts receivable and inventory on a short term basis  usually one year or less 
short term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for principal payments with interest payable monthly 
the company requires a complete re analysis before considering any extension 
the company finances primarily small and middle market businesses in a wide spectrum of industries 
in general  it is the company s intent to take collateral whenever possible regardless of the purpose of the loan 
collateral may include liens on inventory  accounts receivable  fixtures and equipment and in some cases leasehold improvements and real estate 
as a matter of policy  the company generally requires all principals of a business to be co obligors on all loan instruments  and all significant shareholders of corporations to execute a specific debt guaranty 
all borrowers must demonstrate the ability to service and repay not only the debt with the company but also all outstanding business debt  exclusive of collateral  on the basis of historical earnings or reliable projections 
commercial loans typically involve relatively large loan balances and are generally dependent on the businesses cash flows and thus may be subject to adverse conditions in the general economy or in specific industry 
as of december  and  commercial business loans  which include korean affiliate loans and other commercial loans  totaled million and million  respectively representing of total gross loans at both dates 
commercial business loans totaled million at december   representing of total loans 
although commercial business loans increased in  mainly due to a increase in other commercial business loans not related to south korea  commercial loans as a percentage of total loans remained unchanged at 
this was due to faster growth in other sectors and more emphasis on other types of secured loans  primarily real estate loans 
trade finance loans 
for the purpose of financing overseas transactions  the company provides short term trade financing to local borrowers in connection with the issuance of letters of credit to overseas suppliers sellers 
in accordance with these letters of credit  the company extends credit to the borrower by providing assurance to the borrower s foreign suppliers that payment will be made upon shipment of goods 
upon shipment of goods  and when the foreign suppliers negotiate the letters of credit  the borrower s inventory is financed by the company under the approved line of credit facility 
the underwriting procedure for this type of credit is the same as for commercial business loans 
as of december   trade finance loans totaled million  compared to million as of december  because of the faster growth in other segment of loan portfolio  especially real estate loans  trade finance loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to from in in the volume increase was mainly due to the increased bankers acceptances business as a result of new bankers acceptance credit lines established with several banks in korea 
after an intentional decrease of trade finance loans in past years  management cautiously increased trade finance related loans and commitments during  due to i improvement in the credit rating of south korea as well as those of financial institutions in korea from credit rating agencies such as standard poors  and ii increases is in bankers acceptances  which have lesser risk since they are short term and banks are sources of payments 
small business administration sba loans 
the company has offered sba loans since  providing financing for various purposes for small businesses under guarantee of the small business administration  a federal agency created to provide financial assistance for small businesses 
the company is a preferred sba 
table of contents lender with full loan approval authority on behalf of the sba 
it also participates in the sba s export working capital program 
sba loans consist of both real estate and business loans 
the sba guarantees on such loans currently range from to of the principal and accrued interest 
under certain circumstances  the guarantee of principal and interest may be less than 
in general  the guaranteed percentage is less than for loans over million 
the company typically requires that sba loans be secured by first or second lien deeds of trust on real property 
sba loans have terms ranging from to years depending on the use of proceeds 
to qualify for an sba loan  a borrower must demonstrate the capacity to service and repay the loan  exclusive of the collateral  on the basis of historical earnings or reliable projections 
at december   of total sba loans  net of participations sold  were real estate loans secured by deeds of trust on industrial buildings or retail stores 
during the years and  the company originated million  and million in sba loans 
the company adopted a new practice in of selling sba loans every quarter 
since the shift in our sba loan sale policy  the company sold million of sba loans in  more than doubled as compared to previous level of million sba loans sold in  and retained the obligation to service the loans for a servicing fee and to maintain customer relations 
as of december   the company was servicing million of sold sba loans  compared to million as of december  sba loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to in as compared to in  primarily due to increased sale volume in consumer loans 
consumer loans  also termed loans to individuals  are extended for a variety of purposes 
most are to finance the purchase of automobiles 
other consumer loans include secured and unsecured personal loans  home equity lines  overdraft protection loans  and unsecured lines of credit 
the company grants a small portfolio of credit card loans  mainly to the owners of its corporate customers 
management assesses the borrower s ability to repay the debt through a review of credit history and ratings  verification of employment and other income  review of debt to income ratios and other measures of repayment ability 
although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary importance  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security  if any  to the proposed loan amount 
the company generally makes these loans in amounts of or less of the value of collateral 
an appraisal is obtained from a qualified real estate appraisal for substantially all loans secured by real estate 
most of the company s consumer loans are repayable on an installment basis 
consumer loans are generally unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance  because the collateral is more likely to suffer damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  the collection of loans to individuals is dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  often limit the amount  which a lender can recover on consumer loans 
consumer loans may also give rise to claims and defense by consumer loan borrowers against the lender on these loans  such as the company  and a borrower may be able to assert against such assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller or the underlying collateral 
consumer loans remained a small percentage of of total loans as of december   compared to as of december  automobile loans are the largest component of consumer loans  representing and of total consumer loans as of december  and off balance sheet commitments 
as part of its service to its small to medium sized business customers  the company from time to time issues formal commitments and lines of credit 
these commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are short term  or less than one year 
they may be in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs 
however  these commitments may also take the form of standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit 
commercial letters of credit facilitate import trade 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 

table of contents total unused commitments to extent credit were million and million at december  and  respectively 
unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans at december  and  respectively 
the company s stand by letters of credit and commercial letters of credit at december  were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million at december  loans involving country risk the company has historically made three types of credit extensions involving direct exposure to the korean economy i commercial loans to us affiliates or subsidiaries or branches of companies located in south korea korean affiliate loans  ii advances on acceptances by korean banks  and iii loans against standby letters of credit issued by korean banks 
in certain instances  standby letters of credit issued by korean banks support the loans made to the us affiliates or branches of korean companies  to which the company has extended loans 
in addition  the company makes certain loans involving indirect exposure to the economies of south korea as well as other pacific rim countries  as discussed at the end of this section 
the following table sets forth the amounts of outstanding balances in the above three categories for south korea loans and commitments involving korean country risk as of december  category commercial loans to us affiliates or branches of korean companies unused commitments for loans to us affiliates of korean companies acceptances with korean banks standby letters of credit issued by banks in south korea total loans and commitments involving direct exposure to the korean economy totaled million or of total loans and commitments and million or of total loans and commitments as of december  and  respectively 
the company s level of loans and commitments involving such exposure in has decreased as compared to due to million decrease in unused commitments to us affiliates of korean companies and million decrease in bankers acceptances outstanding with korean banks 
in addition to the loans included in the above table  which involve direct exposure to the korean economy  the company also makes loans to many us business customers in the import or export business whose operations are indirectly affected by the economies of various pacific rim countries including south korea 
as of december   loans outstanding involving indirect country risk totaled million  or of the company s total loans  and loans and commitments involving indirect country risk totaled million  or of the company s total loans and commitments 
indirect country risk is defined as the risk associated with loans to such us businesses  which are dependent upon foreign countries for business and trade 
of the million in total loans and commitments involving indirect country risk  approximately involve borrowers doing business with korea  with the remaining percentages to other individual pacific rim countries being relatively small in relation to the total indirect loans involving country risk 
as a result  with the exception of south korea  the company does not believe it has significant indirect country risk exposure to any other specific pacific rim country 

table of contents of the total loans outstanding and commitments involving indirect country risk identified above  approximately of such loans and commitments were to businesses which import goods from korea and were loans or commitments to businesses which export goods to korea 
the potential risks to the company differ depending upon whether the customer is in the export or the import business 
the primary manner in which adverse changes in the economic conditions in the relevant pacific rim countries would affect business customers in the export business is a decrease in the volume in their respective businesses 
as a result  the company s volume of such loans would tend to decrease due to lower demand 
in addition  export loans are generally dependent on the businesses cash flows and thus may be subject to adverse conditions in the general economy of the country or countries with which the customer does its exporting business 
the company s import loans are generally to us domestic business entities whose operations would not be directly affected by the economic conditions of foreign countries  as importers can typically obtain goods from an alternative market if necessary  so the effect on the borrower s business is less significant 
the company limits its risk exposure with respect to export loans by participating in the state and federal agency supported export programs such as the export working capital program and the california export finance office  which guarantee to of the export loans 
the company also requires that a majority of export finance loans are supported by letters of credit issued by established creditworthy commercial banks 
the company also monitors other foreign countries for economic or political risks to the portfolio 
as part of its loan loss allowance methodology  the company assigns one of three rating factors to borrowers in these businesses  depending upon the perceived degree of indirect country risk and allocates an additional amount to the allowance to reflect the potential additional risk from such indirect exposure to the economies of those foreign countries

loan maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates the following table shows the maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the company s outstanding loans as of december  in addition  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with floating interest rates and those with fixed interest rates

management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless they are both fully secured and in process of collection 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms  where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
oreo consists of real property acquired through foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
management s classification of a loan as nonaccrual or restructured is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full collectibility of principal or interest on the loan 
at this point  the company stops recognizing income from the interest on the loan and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but unpaid 
the remaining balance of the loan will be charged off if the loan deteriorates further due to a borrower s bankruptcy or similar financial problems  unsuccessful collection efforts or a loss classification by regulators and or auditors 
these loans may or may not be collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
there was no oreo outstanding at december  if the company acquires oreo  it records it at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value less anticipated disposal costs 
any write down of oreo is charged to earnings 
the company may make loans to potential buyers of oreo to facilitate the sale of oreo 
in those cases  all loans made to such buyers must be reviewed under the same guidelines as those used for making customary loans  and must conform to the terms and conditions consistent with the company s loan policy 
any deviations from this policy must be specifically noted and reported to the appropriate lending authority

the company evaluates impairment of loans according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including contractual interest payments and contractual principal payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
at december   and the company had classified   and  of its loans as impaired with specific reserves of   and  respectively

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment of the level of allowance adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statement of financial condition date 
on a monthly basis  the company assesses the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  utilizing a disciplined and systematic approach which includes the application of a specific allowance for identified problem loans  a formula allowance for identified graded loans  an allocated allowance for large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  and an allocated allowance for country risk exposure 
allowance for specifically identified problem loans 
a specific allowance is established for impaired loans in accordance with sfas a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the specific allowance is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  the company may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  the company measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when it is determined that foreclosure is probable 
formula allowance for identified graded loans 
non homogenous loans such as commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  trade finance and sba loans that are not subject to the allowance for specifically identified loans discussed above are reviewed individually and subject to a formula allowance 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding pass  special mention  substandard and 
table of contents doubtful loans 
the evaluation of inherent loss for these loans involves a high degree of uncertainty  subjectivity and judgment because probable loan losses are not identified with a specific loan 
in determining the formula allowance  we rely on a mathematical calculation that incorporates a twelve quarter rolling average of historical losses 
in order to reflect the impact of recent events  the twelve quarter rolling average has been weighted 
loans risk rated pass  special mention and substandard for the most recent three quarters are adjusted to an annual basis as follows the most recent quarter is weighted  the second most recent is weighted  and the third most recent is weighted the formula allowance may be further adjusted to account for the following qualitative factors changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  changes in the quality of our loan review system and the degree of oversight by the directors  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated losses in our loan portfolio 
allowance for large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans 
the portion of the allowance allocated to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans is focused on loss experience for the pool rather than on an analysis of individual loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans consist of consumer loans to individuals 
the allowance for groups of performing loans is based on historical losses over a three year period 
in determining the level of allowance for delinquent groups of loans  we classify groups of homogenous loans based on the number of day s delinquent 
allowance for country risk exposure 
the allowance for country risk exposure is based on an estimate of probable losses relating to both direct exposure to the korean economy  and indirect exposure to the economies of various pacific rim countries 
the exposure is related to trade finance loans made to support export import business between the us and korea  korean affiliate loans  and certain loans to local us business that are supported by stand by letters of credit issued by korean banks 
as with the credit rating system  we use a country risk grading system under which risk gradings have been divided into three ranks 
to determine the risk grading  the company evaluates loans to companies with a significant portion of their business reliant upon imports or exports to pacific rim countries 
the company then analyzes the degree of dependency on business  suppliers or other business areas dependent upon such countries and applies an individual rating to the credit 
the company provides an allowance for country risk exposure based upon the rating of dependency 
most of the company s business customers whose operations are indirectly affected by the economies of such countries are in the import or export business 
as part of its methodology  the company assigns one of three rating factors  or basis points to borrowers in these businesses  depending upon the perceived degree of indirect exposure to such economies 
the country risk exposure factor reflected in the table below is in addition to the allowance for such loans  which is already reflected  in the formula allowance 
this factor takes into account both the direct risk on 
table of contents the loans included in the loans involving country risk table above  and the loans to import or export businesses involving indirect exposure to the economies of south korea or other pacific rim countries 
the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves judgmental discretion  and eventual losses may therefore differ from even the most recent estimates 
further  the company s independent loan review consultants  as well as the company s external auditors  the fdic and the california department of financial institutions review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process 
the company continued to record loss provisions to compensate for both the continued growth in the company s loan portfolio and the continued change in the composition of the overall loan portfolio  reflecting a steady shift toward commercial real estate and commercial loans 
the allowance for loan losses was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was of total loans as of december  compared to and as of december  and  respectively 
the company recorded  net recoveries in the fourth quarter of from previously charged off loans mostly in  increasing the balance of allowance for loan losses 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was   and as of december    and  respectively 
management thinks the risks in the portfolio are sufficiently lower to justify reducing both the ratio of the allowance to total loans and the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans  since the company s mix of loans shifted towards real estate loans secured by first deeds of trust and experienced a decrease in net charge offs  partially offset by a slight increase in nonaccrual loans 
management believes that the level of allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover the known and probable risks of the nonperforming loans as of december  the following table sets forth the composition of the allowance for loan losses as of dates indicated composition of allowance for loan losses as of december  dollars in thousands specific impaired loans formula non homogeneous homogeneous country risk exposure total allowance and reserve the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  this increase was mainly due to a million increase in the formula non homogeneous allowance and a  increase in the specific impaired allowance 
the increase in the specific allowance for impaired loans was primarily due to an increase in the specific reserve on one construction loan in the principal amount of million 
the company increased specific reserve on this construction loan to  to cover future losses 
formula allowances were increased due to loan growth and increases in delinquent auto and credit card loans 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the country risk allowance and homogeneous allowance 
management is committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered commensurate with estimated and known risks in the portfolio 
although the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed monthly  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the portfolio 
as of starting in the company allocated the specific reserve on all impaired loans  whereas previously the company provided specific reserves only for loans with balances of  or more and allocated formula allowances for the loans with balances of less than  
table of contents december   management believed the allowance to be adequate based on its assessment of the estimated and known risks in the portfolio migration analysis of charge off history  which indicated stabilized loss ratios 
there has been no need to adjust the risk ratios applied to graded loans 
classified loans stood at million as of december  compared to million as of december  showing a increase due to one large nonaccrual construction loan of million and one commercial business loan of million 
commercial business loan of million classified as substandard due to deterioration of borrower s business 
based on the calculation and continued loan recoveries  the level of allowance as of december  is adequate to absorb the estimated losses from any known or inherent risks in the loan portfolio and the loan growth for the year 
however  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased provisions or loan losses in the future 
the provision for loan losses in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
because of the net recoveries recorded in the company was able maintain its loan loss provision at million at december  the provision for increased primarily due to loan portfolio growth

net recoveries charge offs were   and million in  and  respectively 
the biggest single charge off during was  related to a high technology manufacturer whose business failed due to the general slowdown in the technology sector in the us charge offs in were significantly less than in due to greater oversight by the company in monitoring and addressing delinquent and classified loans 
charge offs in were the highest in the past years 
the biggest single charge off during was  related to a trade finance borrower whose business failed

the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is primarily related to lines of credit 
the company evaluates credit risk associated with the loan portfolio at the same time it evaluates credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and letters of credits 
however  as of december   the reserve necessary for the commitments is reported separately in other liabilities in the accompanying statements of financial condition  and not as part of the allowance for loan losses amounted to  as presented above 

table of contents allocation of allowance for loan losses the largest increase in the allocated allowance was for commercial real estate loans  an increase of  or to million during compared to million in the increase in the allocated allowance for was primarily due to the increase in loan volume 
because commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate and historically have a low charge off ratio  commercial real estate loans required a somewhat lower reserve requirement than other loans 
of the total allowance was allocated for commercial real estate loans  while the proportion of such loans to the total loan portfolio was 
the allocated allowance for construction loans increased  or to  at december   compared to  as of the december   primarily due to one large participated construction loan in the amount of million 
the allocated amount in the allowance was increased to cover the company s loss exposure related to this one loan see allowance for loan losses 
the allocated allowance for other trade finance loans increased  or to  during  compared to  as of december   as a result of an increase in the volume of bankers acceptances with investment grade korean banks and the korean government backed national federation of fisheries 
bankers acceptances rely upon repayment at maturity by the accepting bank 
credit exposure related to bankers acceptances is limited by the underlying strength of the accepting bank 
however  the company increased the allocated allowance for trade finance due to higher historical charge off ratio 
at december   the company allocated of the total allowance to other commercial loans  in spite of the fact that the ratio of other commercial loans to total loans was only  because the company has historically experienced the highest percentage losses from this type of loan 
the company has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of its allocation of allowance for loan losses in the periods discussed above 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques in the periods discussed above that affected the determination of the current year allowance

held to maturity securities decreased slightly to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the composition of available for sale and held to maturity securities was and as of december   compared to and as of december   respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   the yield on the average investment portfolio was representing a decrease of basis points as compared to for the same period of the distribution in available for sale portfolio changed substantially in  with a shift out of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations into u 
s government agency securities 
the company used cash flows generated from prepayments in mortgage backed and collateralized mortgage obligation proceeds to purchase agency securities 
part of the proceeds was also used to finance higher yielding loans 
the average balance of taxable investment securities increased by to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the previous year 
the annualized average yield declined basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the previous year 
the basis point decrease in yield was primarily due to higher prepayments recorded on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations due to the low rate environment 
the growth in taxable securities was attributable to the company s investment strategy of replacing its called and matured securities with short term less than year call protected government agency securities  and with corporate securities to temporarily hold as short term investments until the funds are needed to fund newly originated loans 
the average balance of tax advantaged securities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the average yield on tax advantaged securities for the year ended december  was compared to for the same periods last year 
the tax equivalent yield on these same types of securities for the year ended december  was compared to for the previous year 
the significant decrease in yield on the tax advantage securities was primarily due to adjustments to the current lower rate  because these securities are adjustable rate securities 
accordingly  when the rate starts to increase  these securities will generally be repriced to the higher rate unless the securities are called

on the same date  the amounts invested in money market funds were million and million  respectively 
the investment in fed funds averaged million for the year ended december   and million for december  interest earned on these funds averaged for the twelve months of  and in  respectively 
the average investments in money market funds were million at the average yield of during and million at in other assets the company invested in the federal home loan bank fhlb stock totaling million as of december   and  as of december  fhlb stock is required in order to utilize a borrowing facility when needed 
the company purchased million of additional shares of fhlb stock during due to the fhlb s minimum capital stock requirement for its member banks based on the member s december regulatory financial data and on current advances outstanding 
other investments  totaling million and million as of december  and  are comprised of limited partnership interests owned by the company in affordable housing projects for lower income tenants 
investments in such projects enable the company to obtain cra credit and federal and state income tax credits  as previously discussed in provision for income taxes 
in addition  the company invested million in boli in december  to enhance profitability through offsetting employee benefit costs 
boli is an insurance policy with a single premium paid at policy commencement 
its initial  and cash surrender value is 
table of contents equivalent to the premium paid  and it grows through non taxable increases in its cash surrender value through interest earned on the policy  net of the cost of insurance plus any death benefits ultimately received by the company 
the cash surrender value of boli as of december  was million 
cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks represent the largest component of the company s noninterest earning assets 
at december   cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks represented of total assets as compared with in previous year 
this increase was due to a million investment in atm funding program in the company recorded  fee income as a result of this investment in the outstanding balance of cash and due from banks was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the ratio of average cash and due from banks to average total assets remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and  respectively 
even though boli  the investment in the atm funding program  and the investment in affordable housing partnerships all enhance profitability  none of them is classified as an interest earning asset 
the company maintained balances at correspondent banks to cover daily in clearings and other activities 
the average reserve balance requirements were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  most of which were covered by cash on hand and vault cash held  so no additional balances were maintained with federal reserve bank for this purposes 
a significant component of non earning assets is premises and equipment  which is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related leases  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
depreciation expense was million in as compared to million in the net book value of the company s premises and equipment totaled million at december   an increase of million compared to million at december  this increase was mainly due to the opening of the fullerton branch and the relocation of the western office 
all other assets increased by million to million as of december  compared to million at december  the increase principally reflects servicing assets  and the fair value of the interest rate swaps in the amounts of  and  respectively 
deposits the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost core deposits  namely noninterest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words their propensity to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are large certificates of deposits  which generally mean time deposits with balances exceeding  because these deposits particularly when considered together with a customer s other specific deposits may exceed fdic insurance limits  depositors may select shorter maturities to offset perceived risk elements associated with deposits over  the company offers a wide variety of retail deposit account products to both consumer and commercial deposit customers 
time deposits  which are the company s highest cost deposits  consisting primarily of retail fixed rate certificates of deposit  comprised and of the deposit portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of noninterest bearing deposits to total deposits was and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the ratio of noninterest bearing deposits to total deposits has increased during these periods  due to the contributions of new branches opened during through all other deposits  which include interest bearing checking accounts now  savings and money market accounts  accounted for the remaining and of the deposit portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the change in the deposit mix was due to the decreases in money market and now accounts and time certificates of deposits less than  to and in from and of total deposits in 
table of contents the decrease in money market and now accounts in was largely due to the million decrease in individual money market accounts  partially offset by an million increase in business money market accounts 
deposits totaled million at december  as compared to million as of december  reflecting an increase of million or for the twelve months of growth in deposits was largely attributable to the expansion of the branch network and the continued promotion efforts of the deposit products 
deposits gathered from five new branches opened in were million from their inception 
the company can deter  to some extent using wholesale funding sources  the rate hunting customers who demand high rate cds because of local market competition 
in  the company replaced some high cost deposits with lower cost deposits generated by branches and low cost deposits from the state of california 
the company is currently not accepting any new brokered deposits 
however  the company may accept additional brokered deposits  if and when the company can get benefits from the brokered deposits in the future 
total brokered cds were million and million as of december  and  respectively with the maturities ranging from six to eleven month and six to months  respectively

impact of inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company is its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation 
table of contents on our net interest margin through the management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as non interest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this annual report 
market risk asset liability management market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities  but also to a certain extent from foreign exchange rate risk and commodity risk 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company actively monitors its assets and liabilities to mitigate risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  the management s strategy is to match asset and liability balances within maturity categories to limit the company s exposure to earnings fluctuations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
the company s strategy for asset and liability management is formulated and monitored by the company s board committee 
this board committee is composed of four outside directors and the president 
the chief financial officer serves as secretary of the committee 
the board committee meets quarterly to review and adopt recommendations of the asset liability management committee 
the asset liability management committee consists of executive and manager level officers from various areas of the company including lending  investment  and deposit gathering  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management committee is to manage the financial components of the company to optimize the net income under varying interest rate environments 
the focus of this process is the development  analysis  implementation  and monitoring of earnings enhancement strategies  which provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
the asset liability management committee meets regularly to review  among other matters  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability management committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to overall asset and liability composition  and reports regularly to the board committee and the board of directors 
interest rate risk interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
in general  the interest that the company earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established contractually for specified period of time 
market interest rates change over time and if a financial institution cannot quickly adapt to changes in interest rates  it may be exposed to volatility in earnings 
for instance  if the company was to fund long term fixed rate assets with short term variable rate deposits  and interest rates were to rise over the term of the assets  the short term variable deposits would rise in cost  adversely affecting net interest income 
similar risks exist when rate sensitive assets for example  prime rate based loans are funded by longer term fixed rate liabilities in a falling interest rate environment 
in order to monitor and manage interest rate risk  management utilizes quarterly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling as a tool to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value sensitivity of the statements of financial condition 
these techniques are complementary and both are used to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 

table of contents gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice during a particular time interval 
a liability sensitive position results when more liabilities than assets reprice or mature within a given period 
conversely  an asset sensitive position results when more assets than liabilities reprice within a given period 
as of december   the company was asset sensitive with a positive one year gap of million or of total assets and of earning assets 
as the company s assets tend to reprice more frequently than its liabilities over a one year horizon  the company will realize higher net interest income in a rising rate environment and lower net interest income in a falling rate environment 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns 
interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  amounts subject to repricing within months months years after years non sensitive total dollars in thousands assets cash federal fund sold money market funds and interest bearing deposits in other investment securities fhlb and other equity bank stock loans loan loss reserve cash surrender value of life insurance other assets total assets liabilities deposits demand deposit interest bearing savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposit money market and now accounts accrued interest payable acceptances outstanding other borrowed funds long term subordinated debenture other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities shareholders equity interest rate swap period repricing gap cumulative repricing gap as of total assets as of earning assets 
table of contents although the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is a useful measurement tool and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the asset liability management committee also uses simulation modeling on a quarterly basis as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
npv is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  such as the interest rate swaps  and other significant variables considered to be affected by interest rates 
these other significant variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities  cash flows on loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on investment securities purchased  statements of financial condition growth assumptions  and changes in interest rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and npv under immediate rising or falling market rate scenarios in basis point increments up to basis points 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the estimated impact of changes on the company s net interest income over a twelve month period and npv  assuming a parallel shift of to basis points in both directions 
change in basis points net interest income next twelve months change net portfolio value npv change dollars in thousands level as previously indicated  net income increases decreases as market interest rates rise fall  since the company is asset sensitive 
the npv decreases increases  as the rate rises falls  since the npv has a negative convexity reverse relationship with the discount rate 
as above table indicates  basis points drop in rates impacts net interest income by million or decrease  whereas rate increase of basis points impacts net interest income by only million or increase 
since average cost on interest bearing liabilities was at december  the effect of basis points drop in rates on interest bearing liabilities is protected even without a floor  but there may be almost full basis points drop in the yield of interest earning assets 
all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the rate sensitivity analysis at december  at december   the company s estimated changes in net interest income and npv was within the ranges established by the board of directors 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many community banks  which is based upon the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to forecast changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  other factors are incorporated into the model  including prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model  and other available public information 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels of the company product lines 
management believes that the assumptions it uses to evaluate the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience were to differ from the historical experience on which they are based 

table of contents derivatives the company s historical strategies in protecting both net interest income and the economic value of equity from significant movements in interest rates have involved using various methods of assessing existing and future interest rate risk exposure and diversifying and restructuring its investment portfolio accordingly 
the company may use off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swaps  as part of its overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s net interest margin and its shareholders equity 
in late and during  the company entered into four interest rate swaps for total notional amount of million to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the cash flows of specifically identified variable rate loans 
one interest rate swap was terminated partially in the notional amount of million  from the original contract entered in october with a notional value of million  and replaced during august at the same notional amount  but with a years extended maturity to august and receiving a fixed rate of 
the company recorded a deferred gain of  from the termination of the partial notional value of a swap  and is recognizing the gain over the remaining term of the interest rate swap agreement which terminated in october as yield adjustment of the underlying loans 
the remaining notional amount of the million swap from the original million matured on october to replace a maturing interest rate swap with a notional value of million on october   the company entered into a new interest rate swap receiving a fixed rate stream of and paying prime with a year term 
the following table provides information as of december   on company s outstanding derivatives description notional value period fixed receiving rate floating paying rate dollars in thousands interest rate swap i  wsj prime interest rate swap ii  wsj prime interest rate swap iii  wsj prime interest rate swap iv  wsj prime at december   the wall street journal published prime rate was percent 
net interest income of  and  were recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was at a favorable position of  net of tax of  as compared to favorable position of  net of tax of  and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december  and  the related asset on the interest rate swap of  and  was included in other assets 
the company s policies also permit the purchase of rate caps and floors  although the company has not yet engaged in these activities 
liquidity liquidity is the company s ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet deposit withdrawals and loan demands and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
the company s principal sources of liquidity have been growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity of securities  and prepayments from loans 
to supplement its primary sources of liquidity  the company maintains contingent funding sources  which include a borrowing capacity of up to of total assets upon providing collateral with the federal home loan bank of san francisco  access to the discount window of the federal reserve bank of san francisco  a deposit facility with the california state treasurers office up to of total equity with collateral pledging  and unsecured fed funds lines with correspondent banks 
as of december   the company s liquidity ratio  which is the ratio of available liquid funds to net deposits and short term liabilities was 
total available liquidity as of that date was million  consisting of excessive cash holdings or balances in due from banks  overnight fed funds sold  money market funds and uncollateralized securities 
it is the company s policy to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of at least 
the company s net non core fund dependence ratio was under applicable regulatory guidelines  which assumes all certificates of deposit over  jumbo cd s as volatile sources of funds 
the company has identified approximately million of jumbo cd s as stable and core sources of funds based on 
table of contents past historical analysis 
the net non core fund dependence ratio was with the assumption of million as stable and core fund sources and certain portion of mmda as volatile 
the net non core fund dependence ratio is the ratio of net short term investment less non core liabilities divided by the long term assets 
capital resources shareholders equity as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the primary sources of increases in capital have been retained earnings and proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee and or director stock options 
the company did  however  issue million in trust preferred securities in through its wholly owned subsidiary  center capital trust i 
the proceeds of this issuance are considered to be tier capital for regulatory purposes but long term debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  no assurance can be given that the trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as tier capital in the future 
shareholders equity is also affected by increases and decreases in unrealized losses on securities classified as available for sale and appreciation of fair value of interest rate swaps for hedging of certain prime rate based loans 
the company is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure shareholders  customers  and regulators that the company is financially sound and able to support its growth from its retained earnings 
since inception  the company has been reinvesting its earnings into its capital in order to support the company s continuous growth through the payment of stock rather than cash dividends 
beginning in october center financial commenced a new dividend policy of paying quarterly cash dividends to its shareholders 
in accordance with this policy  the company paid a cash dividend of cents per share in october  for a total of  the company plans to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future  provided that such dividends allow the company to continue to meet regulatory capital requirements and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company is subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
the risk based capital guidelines assign risk weightings to assets both on and off balance sheet and place increased emphasis on common equity 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i risk based capital ratio  total risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio meet or exceed   and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
as of december   all of the company s capital ratios were well above the minimum regulatory requirements for a well capitalized institution
