overview we are a worldwide producer of ion implantation  dry strip  rapid thermal processing and photostabilization equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
in addition  we provide extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services 
we own of the equity of a joint venture  known as sen  with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
in japan 
sen licenses technology from the company relating to the manufacture of ion implantation products and has exclusive rights to manufacture and sell these products to the territory of japan 
sen is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in japan 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described in detail below  the company considers a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  and the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions  and the installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance than we now experience  the company may have to revise its revenue recognition policy  which could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for revenue arrangements prior to july  axcelis generally recognized the full sale price at the time of shipment to the customer 
the costs of system installation at the customer s site were accrued at the time of shipment for installation and acceptance testing performance obligations incurred at the time of sale 
the company recognized the full sales price at the time of shipment as management believes that the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process were established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory because the process was a replication of the pre shipment procedures 
also  customer payment terms typically provide that the majority of the purchase price is payable upon shipment 
terms do generally contain delayed payment arrangements for a portion of the purchase price  which are typically time based 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
this issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf became effective for revenue arrangements entered into in periods beginning after june  for revenue arrangements occurring on or after july   the company has revised its revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf axcelis revenue transactions include sales of systems under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to all elements  except systems  based upon their estimated fair market value 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on the greater of the fair value of the undelivered elements or the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the elements are delivered  with the residual amount being allocated to systems revenue 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
the fair value of all other elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
system revenue is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue for installation services is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
management continues to believe recognition of systems revenue at the time of shipment is appropriate because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory because the process is a replication of the pre shipment procedures 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  per contract terms  many customers request that newer systems are to be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers for mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
axcelis has never failed to successfully complete a system installation 
should an installation not be successfully completed  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications upon shipment of the system  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue until written customer acceptance of the system 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
service revenue includes revenue from spare parts  equipment upgrades and maintenance services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenue related to time and material services is recorded when the services are performed 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized upon the later of shipment or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
deferred tax assets the company has deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which are available to reduce taxable income in future periods 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods  existing sales backlog and projections of future operating results 
where there are cumulative losses in recent years  sfas no 
creates a strong presumption that a valuation allowance is needed 
this presumption can be overcome in very limited circumstances 
as of march  and december   the company s evaluation of the realization of these assets was based upon evidence of cumulative historical profitability and estimates of future taxable income 
the company was profitable in year but was not profitable in years and projections of future earnings were based on revenue assumptions consistent with industry forecasts for the next three years along with the necessary operating expenses to support the company s revenue assumptions 
based on these projections  the company estimated that the loss carryforwards would be fully utilized within three years 
during the second quarter of  the company entered a three year cumulative loss position and revised its projections of the amount and timing of future earnings 
due to these factors as well as the uncertainty of the amount and timing of profitability in future periods  the company increased its valuation allowance as of june  this non cash charge to earnings increased income tax expense by million for the year ended december  the company expects to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until it can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  the company would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in its future results of operations 
however  going forward should the company return to profitability and there is sufficient evidence  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 to support the ultimate realization of income tax benefits attributable to net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  a reduction in the valuation allowance may be recorded and the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be restored  resulting in a non cash credit to earnings 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their useful lives 
such other identifiable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology and customer related intangibles and are generally amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 
we have determined that all of our intangible assets have finite lives 
during  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an impairment review of our goodwill 
impairment tests are performed annually  or more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
the annual impairment test consists of determining the fair market value of the business unit through a discounted cash flow analysis 
management s best judgments are employed in determining future market conditions that impact this discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of our annual review conducted as of december   we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations as a non cash charge to earnings 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of future materials usage  based on estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product warranty and installation costs the company offers a one to three year warranty for all of its products  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
prior to july   the company estimated the costs that may be incurred under its standard warranty and product installation obligation and recorded a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue was recognized 
subsequent to july   in connection with the change in its revenue recognition policy see revenue recognition  the company no longer accrues the estimated costs of its installation but defers the revenue related to the greater of the fair value of the installation services or the amount of revenue that is contingent upon the completion of the installation services 
factors that affect the company s warranty and installation liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty and installation liability and adjusts the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales systems services gross profit other costs and expenses research and development selling general administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring loss from operations other income expense sumitomo eaton nova corporation royalty income equity income other royalty income interest income interest expense other net loss before income taxes income taxes credit net loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  net sales sales of systems were million or of net sales in  compared with million  or of net sales  in the increase in sales of systems was primarily attributable to increased levels of production volume by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
increased sales were offset in part by reduced average selling prices caused by a competitive market environment and a concentration of systems sales to a limited number of customers 
sales of services  which include spare parts  service labor and equipment upgrades  accounted for million  or of net sales  in compared with million  or of net sales in the demand for our services increased primarily as a result of improved capacity utilization by our customers 
for revenue arrangements occurring on or after july   the company revised its revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this change had the effect of reducing the net sales by million in sales of ion implantation products and services accounted for million of revenue in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in sales of other products and services  including dry strip products  photostabilization products and rapid thermal processing systems  accounted for million in an increase of million  or  compared with million in gross profit gross profit was of net sales in compared to gross profit of in the decrease in gross profit was due to higher warranty costs associated with mm product shipments approximately  the company s implementation of a revised revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf approximately  and a reduction in average selling prices discussed above  approximately 
these items were offset by improved manufacturing costs due to increased factory utilization and lower raw material costs 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease in research and development expense in is due principally to lower investment in our mm product development efforts and a corresponding reduction in headcount by approximately from december  to at december  final completion and release of mm products was accomplished in the second half of research and development expense for the fourth quarter of was million and the company expects to spend in the range of to million per quarter for research and development through selling selling expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared to million in the increase in selling expense was primarily due to increased sales and sales support investments for our expanding asia pacific markets 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared with million in the decrease in general and administrative expense was attributable to lower costs associated with programmed headcount reductions and an adjustment of million to reflect a change in estimate relating to unfunded pension expense and other benefits recorded in prior periods 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in  an increase of thousand  or  as compared with million in the increase was due to amortization expense relating to the intangible assets acquired as part of the matrix integrated systems  inc acquisition completed on july restructuring restructuring costs of million in relate to severance and other benefits associated with reduction in force actions the company took during the third quarter of to reduce headcount by approximately permanent positions 
at december  million had been paid  with the remaining balance of million expected to be paid by the end of the company estimates the annual savings from the restructuring to approximate million  benefits from which began to be realized in the fourth quarter of other income expense total other income was million in as compared to million in other income consists primarily of royalty income and equity income from sen 
royalty income from sen was million in as compared to million in equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in the change in sen s revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf had the effect of reducing the combined contribution royalties and equity income from sen by approximately million for other fluctuations in royalty and equity contributions from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and operating earnings resulting from changes in the japanese semiconductor market 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments

see further discussion under critical accounting policies 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  net sales sales of systems were million or of net sales in  compared with million  or of net sales  in the decrease in sales of systems was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volume arising from decreased levels of production volume by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
sales of services  which include spare parts  equipment upgrades and maintenance services  accounted for million  or of net sales  in compared with million  or of net sales in the decrease in sales of services reflects the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and the related decline in capacity utilization by our customers which translates into a decline in demand for support services and spare parts 
sales of ion implantation products and services accounted for million of revenue in a decrease of million  or  compared to million in sales of other products and services  including dry strip products  photostabilization products and rapid thermal processing systems  accounted for million of revenue in an increase of million  or  compared to million in gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in this decrease was due principally to lower manufacturing capacity utilization caused by lower sales volume and an increasing mix of mm sales which currently have lower average gross margins 
mm sales comprised of systems sales in compared to only of total system sales in research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease in research and development expense between years was due principally to a lower investment in our mm product development efforts consistent with the completion of the launch of our mm products during the year 
selling selling expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in the decrease in selling expense was primarily due to lower sales commissions and lower marketing expenses associated with lower overall sales volume and lower headcount and related expenses  net of severance costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared with million in the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses incurred in connection with the company s patent litigation with applied materials  inc of million see part i  item legal proceedings  a decrease in headcount related expenses net of severance costs of million and a decrease in expenses associated with transitioning to a stand alone company of million 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was due to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as described under notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
other income expense total other income was million in as compared to million in other income consists primarily of royalty income and equity income from sen 
royalty income  primarily from sen  was million in as compared to million in equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in the equity income decline was attributable to lower sen sales volume due primarily to the continuing weakness in the japanese semiconductor market 
despite the decline in sen revenues between years  royalty income increased between years due to a more favorable mix of sen products shipped in compared to interest expense of million in relates to the company s long term debt issued in january see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
income taxes credit the company had an income tax credit of million in as compared to million in our effective income tax rate was in as compared to in the tax rate in both periods differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to undistributed nontaxable equity income from sen and credits from increased research activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments between years is mainly attributable to the company s pretax loss of million for the year ended december   recognized equity income of sen of million which is not realized in cash  changes of million in other elements of working capital which reflect an increase in sales order activity in the last half of the year see outlook below  and the acquisition of matrix integrated systems in july for cash and acquisition expenses aggregating million 
net working capital was million at december  as compared to net working capital of million at december  the decrease in net working capital is mainly attributable to the company s pre tax loss for the year of million  recognized equity income of sen of million included in other assets  and the net impact on working capital related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on net current deferred tax assets recognized in prior periods 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to the completion in the first half of of the addition of the company s advanced technology center and manufacturing facility in beverly  massachusetts 
the company has no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures are projected to approximate depreciation expense 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of the expansion of our business 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
in october the company renegotiated its million revolving credit facility to extend the maturity to october the purpose of the facility is to provide funds for working capital and general corporate purposes as required 
to the extent that the company has borrowings under the agreement  those borrowings would bear interest at the bank s base rate  as defined in the agreement  or libor plus an applicable percentage 
the company currently has no plans to borrow against the facility but may use the facility to support letters of credit in the future 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants including minimum levels of tangible net worth  liquidity  profitability and indebtedness as well as maximum levels of capital spending 
at december  the company did not meet a required liquidity threshold to allow it to borrow against the facility 
the company estimates that it will satisfy this liquidity threshold by the second quarter of and that borrowings pursuant to the terms of the underlying credit agreement will be available if needed 
during january  the company realized net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of a building 
the following represents the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the company as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt   purchase order commitments   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter unused line of credit   standby letters of credit   guarantees    total commercial commitments     axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company has standby letters of credit to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe 
guarantees of which million are cash collateralized relate to value added tax refunds in europe 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin 
fin provides a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses 
the provisions of fin are effective for enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  for public companies with variable interest in variable interest entities created before february   the provisions of fin are to be applied no later than december  the company has determined that its equity investment in sen does not constitute a variable interest entity that would require consolidation 
accordingly  fin did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
outlook the company s performance for the year ended december  was directly related to continuing low levels of capital expenditures through the first nine months of the year by semiconductor manufacturers  especially manufacturers opening new or expanding existing fabrication facilities 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products utilizing them  the available manufacturing capacity in manufacturers fabrication facilities  and the ability of manufacturers to increase productivity in existing facilities without incurring additional capital expenditures 
currently  management  along with industry and economic analysts  believe that semiconductor manufacturers are looking to expand capacity and increase capital spending over the next twelve to twenty four months 
based on bookings received in the third and fourth quarters of the company believes it will begin to realize benefits in terms of increased revenues and improved operating performance from this anticipated upturn in capital spending during management has continued its ongoing actions to reduce manufacturing costs as well as decrease research and development and sg a expense 
during the third quarter of  the company took actions to reorganize the business and eliminate permanent positions 
these actions are estimated to result in annual savings of million  the benefit of which started to be realized in the fourth quarter of on january   the company announced its expectation that its revenues for the first quarter of will be in the range of to million  an increase of to in comparison to reported revenues for the fourth quarter of on these forecast revenues  management stated that gross margins are expected to be in the mid range and net income per share for the first quarter of was expected to be to per share 
it is difficult for us to predict our customers capital spending plans  which can change very quickly 
in addition  at our current sales level  each sale  or failure to make a sale  could have a material effect on us in a particular quarter 
risk factors some of the matters discussed in this filing contain forward looking statements regarding future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described by such statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes  the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  quarterly fluctuations in operating results attributable to the timing and amount of orders for our products and services  dependence on sen our japanese joint venture for access to the japanese semiconductor equipment market  and those risk factors contained in the section titled outlook and exhibit of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
if any of those risk factors actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities  and by limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio and  due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
as of december   all investments had a maturity within days and were carried at cost  which approximates fair value 
to the extent the company has borrowings in the future under the revolving credit facility  such borrowings would be exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in the bank s base rate or libor 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results 
operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenues are billed in us dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local functional currency 
during the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were derived from foreign operations with this inherent risk 
our investment in sen and our royalty and equity income from sen are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
the effect of a depreciation of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar would result in a write down in the company s investment in sen and a corresponding decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity of million at december
