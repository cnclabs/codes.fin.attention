item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we refine and sell petroleum products and operate service stations and convenience stores 
our operations are divided into three strategic business units  the refining group  the retail group and phoenix fuel 
the refining group operates two refineries in the four corners area of new mexico and one refinery in yorktown  virginia 
the refining group sells its products to approximately wholesale distributors and retail chains 
our retail group operated service stations at december  the retail group sells its petroleum products and merchandise to consumers located in new mexico  arizona and southern colorado 
phoenix fuel distributes commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in arizona 
in order to maintain and improve our financial performance  we are focused on several critical and challenging objectives 
we will be addressing these objectives in the short term as well as over the next three to five years 
in our view  the most important of these objectives are increasing gross margins through management of inventories and taking advantage of sales and purchasing opportunities  while minimizing or reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures 

table of contents increasing the available crude oil supply for our four corners refineries 
cost effectively complying with current environmental regulations as they apply to our refineries  including future clean air standards  between now and the end of planning for the retirement of our senior subordinated notes  in the principal amount of  due in improving our overall financial health and flexibility by reducing our debt and overall cost of capital  including our interest and financing costs 
critical accounting policies a critical step in the preparation of our financial statements is the selection and application of accounting principles  policies  and procedures that affect the amounts that are reported 
in order to apply these principles  policies  and procedures  we must make judgments  assumptions  and estimates based on the best available information at the time 
actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events  some of which we may have little or no control over 
in addition  the methods used in applying the above may result in amounts that differ considerably from those that would result from the application of other acceptable methods 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure below  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our significant accounting policies  including revenue recognition  inventory valuation and maintenance costs  are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the following accounting policies are considered critical due to the uncertainties  judgments  assumptions and estimates involved accounting for contingencies  including environmental remediation and litigation liabilities  assessing the possible impairment of long lived assets  accounting for asset retirement obligations  and accounting for our pension and post retirement benefit plans 
contingencies  including environmental remediation and litigation liabilities we have recorded various environmental remediation liabilities described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements in item for the most part  these liabilities result from past operations  including liabilities arising out of changes in environmental laws  and liabilities assumed in connection with acquired assets 
we are remediating these matters 
we record liabilities if environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we do not discount environmental liabilities to their present value 
in general  we record environmental liabilities without consideration of potential recoveries from third parties  although we do take into account amounts that others are contractually obligated to pay us 
we employ independent consultants or our internal environmental personnel to investigate and assemble pertinent facts  recommend an appropriate remediation plan in light of regulatory standards  assist in estimating remediation costs based on existing technologies  and complete remediation according to approved plans 
if we do not use consultants  we estimate remediation costs based on the knowledge and experience of our employees having responsibility for the remediation project 
because of the uncertainty involved in our various remediation efforts and the period of time our efforts may take to complete  estimates are based on current regulatory standards 
we update our estimates as needed to reflect changes in the facts known to us  available technology  or applicable laws 
we often make subsequent adjustments to estimates  which may be significant  as more information becomes 
table of contents available to us  as the requirements of government agencies are changed or clarified  or as other circumstances change 
we record liabilities for litigation matters when it is probable that the outcome of litigation will be adverse and the costs and damages can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate these costs and damages based on the facts and circumstances of each case  our knowledge and experience  and the knowledge and experience of others with whom we may consult 
we often make subsequent adjustments to our estimates  which may be significant  as more information becomes available to us or as other circumstances change 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
for assets held for sale  we report long lived assets at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
for assets held and used  we use an undiscounted cash flow methodology to assess their recoverability 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows for these assets is less than their carrying value  we record impairment losses 
goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives are also subject to an annual impairment test 
changes in current economic conditions  assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of cash flows  or fair market value estimates could result in additional write downs of these assets in the future 
for a discussion of our impairment of long lived assets  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item asset retirement obligations we have legal obligations associated with the retirement of some of our long lived assets 
these obligations are related to some of our solid waste management facilities  some of our crude pipeline right of way agreements  and our underground and above ground storage tanks 
we use a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations 
key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of these obligations are settlement date occurs at the end of the economic useful life  and settlement prices are estimated using consultant proposals and third party contractor invoices for substantially equivalent work and a market risk premium to cover uncertainties and unforeseeable circumstances 
changes in current economic conditions  assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of cash flows  or fair market value estimates could result in a change in the obligation in the future 
for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item pension and post retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our pension and post retirement plans are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist of equity and debt securities  are valued using market prices 
plan obligations and the annual pension and post retirement medical 
table of contents expense are determined by independent actuaries and are based on a number of assumptions 
the key assumptions used in measuring the plan obligations include discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions for our cash balance plan would have had on the projected benefit obligation  our reported pension liability on our consolidated balance sheet and our reported pension expense on our consolidated statement of operations increase decrease impact on projected impact on impact on actuarial assumption a benefit obligation pension liability pension expense discount rate increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant

a processing unit turnaround at our yorktown refinery  which resulted in the refinery being out of operation from march  to april  on april   a breaker failure disrupted operations at the electric generation plant that supplies our yorktown refinery with power 
as a result of the failure  the refinery suffered a complete loss of power and shut down all processing units 
the refinery was operating at full capacity by the middle of may 
we incurred costs of approximately  as a result of the loss of power  all of which were expensed in the second quarter of reduced production also resulted in the loss of earnings 

table of contents stronger net refining margins at our refineries in  due to  among other things lower domestic crude oil and finished product inventories  and strong domestic finished product demand  weaker net refining margins at our refineries in due to  among other things continuing high inventories of distillates resulting from a drop in jet fuel demand following the september  terrorists attack  warmer than normal winter temperatures in the northeast  worldwide crude oil production levels and middle east tensions  which added to higher crude values  imported finished products that placed downward pressure on gasoline values  and losses on various crude oil futures contracts 
continued reduced production at our four corners refineries because of lower crude oil receipts due to supplier production problems and reduced supply availability 
stronger finished product sales volumes with relatively stable margins for our phoenix fuel operations 
the shutdown of the kinder morgan pipeline  which supplies the phoenix  arizona market  in the middle of august caused some supply imbalances and negatively impacted inventory values 
this negative impact was offset in part by higher margins for phoenix fuel s unattended fuel operations 
strong retail fuel margins and improved merchandise margins in for several of our market areas 
this was offset in part due to increased competition in certain of our markets 
net losses on the disposal write down of assets of  in in  we recorded net gains on the disposal write down of assets of comparison of the years ended december  and december  earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the following four factors an increase in operating earnings from our yorktown refinery of a increase in our four corners refineries refining margins 
a increase in our retail group fuel margins 
a increase in our retail group merchandise margins 
factors negatively affecting our earnings include a increase in our selling  general and administrative costs 
a increase in operating expenses for our operations other than yorktown 
a decline in our four corners refineries fuel volumes sold 
a increase in interest expense 
net losses on the disposal write down of assets in compared to a net gain in 
table of contents yorktown refinery we owned our yorktown refinery for all of  but only for seven and one half months in the refinery operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in refining margins for were per barrel and for revenues for our yorktown refinery increased in due to a increase in finished product volumes sold and a increase in finished product selling prices 
most of the volume increase was due to the number of months of ownership 
sales volumes were reduced in each year because of the items previously discussed above  and additionally in  hurricane isabel required us to shutdown the refinery for a period of time 
cost of products sold for our yorktown refinery increased in primarily due to the increase in finished product volumes sold and a increase in average crude oil costs 
in february  we entered into a long term supply agreement with statoil  which we believe will provide a significant proportion of our yorktown refinery s crude oil needs over the next five years 
under the terms of the agreement  supplies of acidic crude oil will be delivered to our yorktown refinery beginning in late february in september  we plan to shut down certain units at the refinery for to days for various upgrades related to the acidic crude oil we will be processing 
following these upgrades at the refinery  the deliveries of crude oil under the statoil agreement will substantially increase 
we believe our ability to process this higher acid crude oil will reduce our crude oil costs  improve our high value product output  and contribute significantly to higher earnings 
we believe this agreement will improve our competitiveness and reduce the impact of pricing volatility 
in  our yorktown refining margins improved due to a combination of factors  including cold weather in the northeast in the early part of the year  resulting in an increased demand for heating oil  an extended summer driving season  resulting in part from warmer than normal east coast temperatures  and reduced foreign gasoline imports  due in part to the phase in of stricter gasoline specifications 
operating  sg a and depreciation expenses for our yorktown refinery also increased in four corners refineries our four corners refineries operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in refining margins for were per barrel and for revenues for our four corners refineries increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices  offset in part by a decrease in finished product volumes sold 
sales volumes were reduced because of lower crude oil supplies due to the reasons previously discussed 
sales volumes previously sold to our travel center  which was sold in  continue to be sold to the purchaser of the travel center under a long term supply agreement 
cost of products sold for our four corners refineries increased in primarily due to a increase in average crude oil costs  offset in part by a decrease in finished product volumes sold 
our four corners refining margins improved in due to a combination of factors  including refinery supply problems on the west coast  refinery turnarounds by our competitors  and the kinder morgan pipeline rupture in august  which affected fuel supplies in the phoenix  arizona and northern arizona markets 

table of contents operating expenses for our four corners refineries increased in due to increased purchased fuel costs  because of higher prices  and higher general insurance costs 
depreciation expense for our four corners refineries declined in due to lower refinery turnaround amortization costs in our ciniza refinery is scheduled for a major turnaround in the second quarter of retail group average gasoline and diesel margins for our retail group were per gallon for and were per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold for increased approximately 
average merchandise margins for our retail group were in and were in revenues for our retail group increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices 
cost of products sold for our retail group increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product purchase prices 
our retail fuel margins improved in due to a combination of factors  including the kinder morgan pipeline rupture  which affected the supply of finished products in the phoenix  arizona and southern arizona markets  more effectively managing our fuel pricing  and more favorable market conditions 
our retail merchandise margins improved in due to a combination of factors  including more favorable market conditions  implementation of marketing programs  and favorable supplier arrangements 
operating expenses for our retail group increased in due to higher payroll and related costs  higher credit card processing fees due to higher gasoline and diesel fuel selling prices  and increased environmental costs 
depreciation expense for our retail group declined in due to some retail assets becoming fully depreciated 
phoenix fuel gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold by phoenix fuel increased by in average gasoline and diesel fuel margins for phoenix fuel were per gallon for and were per gallon for revenues for phoenix fuel increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices and a increase in finished product volumes sold 
finished product sales volumes increased due to marketing efforts to attract new customers and increased sales to existing customers because of increased demand and expanded customer operations 
cost of products sold for phoenix fuel increased in due to a increase in finished product purchase prices and a increase in finished product volumes sold 
our phoenix fuel finished product margins remained relatively stable in  declining approximately as a result of market conditions 

table of contents operating expenses for phoenix fuel increased in due to higher payroll and related costs due to higher sales volumes  and higher repair and maintenance costs due to expanded fleet expenses  also related to higher sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for the year ended december   sg a expenses increased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
the increase includes sg a increases relating to the yorktown refinery of  sg a expense increases for our other operations were due to accruals for management incentive bonuses  increased costs for our self insured health plan  due to higher claims experience  higher workers compensation costs  increased letter of credit fees  and higher officers and directors insurance premiums 
the first quarter of included a credit of  in sg a expenses for the revision of estimated accruals for management incentive bonuses  following the determination of bonuses to be paid to employees 
interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended december   interest expense increased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
interest expense increased approximately  due to the issuance of senior subordinated notes for the may acquisition of our yorktown refinery 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in interest expense of approximately  relating to our  of senior subordinated notes due that were repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the issuance of the senior subordinated notes in  and lower interest expense of approximately  relating to lower borrowings under our revolving credit facility in net gain loss on the disposal write down of assets from continuing operations for the year ended december   we recorded net losses on the disposal write down of assets of  this amount includes the write off of  of capitalized costs relating to a capital project associated with our four corners refinery operations  which management determined was no longer viable after completing an ongoing evaluation  impairment write downs of  related to various retail assets and vacant land and net losses of  related to other asset sales and write offs 
in  we recorded net gains on the disposal write down of assets of  primarily related to the sale of various retail units and vacant land  offset in part by impairment write downs related to various retail assets 
income taxes from continuing operations the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately 
the effective tax benefit rate for year ended december  was approximately 
we believe that the tax benefit created in will be fully realized 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the operations of some of our retail service station convenience stores and our travel center  which was sold on june  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information relating to these operations 

table of contents outlook overall  we believe that our current refining fundamentals are more positive now than the same time last year 
fuel and merchandise margins for our retail group are stronger now than they were this time last year  with same store fuel and merchandise volumes above the prior year s levels 
phoenix fuel currently continues to see growth in both wholesale and unmanned fleet fueling volumes with relatively stable margins 
the businesses we are in  however  are very volatile and there can be no assurance that currently existing conditions will continue for any of our business segments 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  certain factors affecting the company s operations for the year ended december   include  among others  the following the acquisition of the yorktown refinery on may  shortly after the acquisition  the yorktown refinery experienced three significant unscheduled unit shutdowns  the last of which occurred on july  these shutdowns impacted the amount of high value products we were able to produce and the volume of crude oil we were able to process at the refinery 
weaker refining margins at our refineries due to  among other things  high nationwide inventories of distillates  an increase in imported finished products  and higher crude values due to worldwide crude oil production levels  middle east tensions and a labor strike in venezuela 
a significantly greater volume of products produced and sold by the yorktown refinery as compared to our other refining operations  results in us having a larger exposure to volatile refinery margins  which will positively or negatively affect our profitability 
continuing decline in four corners crude oil supplies 
competitive conditions in our phoenix and tucson retail markets due to increased price competition 
net gains on the disposal write down of assets of  in in  we recorded net losses of  on the disposal write down of assets 
the fourth quarter of showed a general improvement in refining margins and finished product margins  for all segments of our operations  compared to those posted for most of the three previous quarters of this resulted in a significant improvement in operating earnings for the fourth quarter compared to prior quarters 
earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december   we incurred a loss before income taxes of  compared to earnings before income taxes of  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the following factors a decrease in our four corners refineries refining margins  an operating loss of  for our yorktown refinery  and increased interest expense and amortization of financing costs related to our yorktown refinery acquisition and the refinancing of our notes 
other factors contributing to the decrease in earnings include an decrease in our retail group fuel margins  a decrease in our retail group fuel volumes sold  and a decrease in our retail group merchandise margins  
table of contents these factors were partially offset by a net gain on the disposal write down of assets of  in and net losses on the disposal write down of assets of  in  a decrease in our selling  general and administrative costs for our operations other than yorktown  a decrease in operating expenses for our operations other than yorktown  and an increase in phoenix fuel fuel margins 
yorktown refinery we owned our yorktown refinery for seven and one half months in the refinery operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day and had refining margins per barrel 
sales volumes for our yorktown refinery of  barrels were reduced because of the items previously discussed 
refining margins for yorktown were per barrel for and were affected by the items previously discussed in addition to a drop in finished product values shortly after our acquisition of the refinery which resulted in low margins because of the higher value of the inventories we acquired 
four corners refineries our four corners refineries operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in refining margins for our four corners refineries in were per barrel and were per barrel for revenues for our four corners refineries decreased in primarily due to a decrease in finished product selling prices 
cost of products sold for our four corners refineries decreased in primarily due to a decrease in average crude oil costs 
refining margins for our four corners refineries declined in by due to the factors previously discussed 
operating expenses for our four corners refineries increased due to higher purchased fuel costs  because of higher prices  higher payroll and related costs  and higher general insurance costs 
these increases were offset in part by lower repair and maintenance costs 
depreciation and amortization expense for our four corners refineries was higher in due to a revision in the estimated amortization period for certain refinery turnaround costs incurred in  and capital expenditure projects during and retail group average gasoline and diesel fuel margins for our retail group were per gallon for and were per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold in decreased approximately 
revenues for our retail group decreased in primarily due to a decrease in finished product selling prices and a decrease in finished product volumes sold 
cost of products sold for our retail group decreased in primarily due to a decrease in finished product purchase prices and a decrease in finished product volumes sold 

table of contents our retail fuel margins declined in primarily due to increased competition from non traditional marketers  such as supermarkets and club membership warehouses  and from independent and major oil companies 
our retail merchandise margins declined in primarily due to market conditions 
operating expenses for our retail group decreased in due to  among other things  lower lease expense due to the repurchase of retail units from ffca capital holding corporation ffca in july that had been sold to ffca as part of a sale leaseback transaction in december  reduced expenses for payroll and related costs  and other operating expenses due in part to the sale or closure of retail units since the end of  as well as the implementation of certain cost reduction programs 
depreciation expense for our retail group decreased in due to reductions in depreciation expense due to the sale or closure of retail units since the end of and the non amortization of goodwill in due to the adoption of sfas no 
these decreases were partially offset by increases relating to the ffca transaction discussed above and construction  remodeling and upgrades during and phoenix fuel gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold by phoenix fuel decreased in by approximately

selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for the year ended december   sg a expenses decreased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
included in the decrease are sg a expenses of  relating to the yorktown refinery 
sg a expense decreases relating to our other operations were primarily due to lower expense accruals for management incentive bonuses in  the revision of estimated accruals for management incentive bonuses following the determination of bonuses to be paid to employees  and expenses incurred in related to certain related party transactions and certain environmental matters 
these decreases were offset in part by expenses recorded for the settlement of certain claims  assessments  and legal matters  including the matter set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  and increased letter of credit fees 

table of contents interest expense income from continuing operations for the year ended december   interest expense increased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
approximately  of the increase is due to the issuance of new senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our new loan facilities entered into in connection with the acquisition of the yorktown refinery as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item in addition  because of the timing of the yorktown refinery acquisition and the notes financing  we were unable to provide the day notice required by the indenture supporting our notes for refinancing the notes prior to the issuance of the notes 
as a result  we paid interest on the notes for days after the financing  which amounted to approximately  these increases were offset in part by a decrease in interest expense of approximately  relating to the repayment of  of senior subordinated notes due with a portion of the proceeds of the issuance of  of notes 
for the year ended december   interest income decreased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest and investment income from the investment of funds in short term instruments 
this reduction was due in part to a reduction in the amount of funds available for investment because of the repurchase of retail units from ffca in july and the acquisition of the yorktown refinery 
in addition  no interest income was accrued in relating to the note from a related party discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item amortization write off of financing costs from continuing operations in connection with the acquisition of the yorktown refinery and the refinancing of notes we incurred approximately  of deferred financing costs relating to new senior subordinated debt and new senior secured loan facilities 
these costs are being amortized over the term of the related debt 
the increase in the amortization write off of financing costs for the year ended december  was  primarily related to the amortization of the costs described above 
the increase also includes the write off of approximately  in deferred financing costs related to the notes that were refinanced 
net gain loss on the disposal write down of assets from continuing operations for the year ended december   we recorded net gains on the disposal write down of assets of  this amount included net gains of  primarily related to the sale of vacant land and various retail units  offset in part by  of impairment write downs related to various retail assets and  of other write offs 
in  we recorded losses of  this amount included losses of  on the sale of assets in the ordinary course of business  primarily related to the sale of eleven service station convenience stores  losses of  on the write down of assets due to impairment  resulting from the application of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
due to a strategy to sell certain service station convenience stores  some of which were closed  losses of  relating to the value of leasehold improvements included in leased service station convenience stores returned to the lessors  and losses of  primarily related to the retirement or replacement of certain refinery property  plant  and equipment 
in addition  the company recorded a reserve in the amount of  in  for a note and interest receivable from a related party as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item income taxes from continuing operations the effective tax benefit rate for year ended december  was approximately 
we believe that the tax benefit created in will be fully realized 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately

liquidity and capital resources capital structure at december  we had long term debt of  net of the current portion of  at december  our long term debt was  net of the current portion of  both of these amounts include  of senior subordinated notes due  and  of senior subordinated notes due we also have a  revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is primarily a working capital and letter of credit facility 
at december   we had no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility and  of letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we had  of direct borrowings outstanding under this facility and  of letters of credit outstanding 
we also have a mortgage loan facility that had a balance of  at december  and  at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for a further description of these obligations 
at december   our long term debt was of total capital 
at december   it was 
our net debt long term debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization percentage at december   was 
at december   this percentage was 
the decrease in each percentage is primarily related to the reduction in long term debt during as described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  the indentures governing our notes and our credit facility and loan facility contain restrictive covenants and other terms and conditions that if not maintained  if violated  or if certain conditions are met  could result in default  affect our ability to borrow funds  make certain payments  or engage in certain activities 
a default under any of the notes  the credit facility or the loan facility could cause such debt  and by reason of cross default provisions  our other debt to become immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to repay such amounts  the lenders under our credit facility and loan facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt 
if those lenders accelerate the payment of the credit facility and loan facility  we cannot provide assurance that our assets would be sufficient to pay that debt and other debt or that we would be able to refinance such debt or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to comply with the covenants  and other terms and conditions  of the indentures  the credit facility and the loan facility may be affected by many events beyond our control  and we cannot provide assurance that our operating results will be sufficient to allow us to comply with the covenants 
we expect to be in compliance with the covenants going forward  and we do not believe that any presently contemplated activities will be constrained 
a prolonged period of low refining margins  however  would have a negative impact on our ability to borrow funds and to make expenditures for certain purposes and would have an impact on compliance with our debt covenants 
our high degree of leverage and these covenants may  among other things limit our ability to use cash flow  or obtain additional financing  for future working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  restrict our ability to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock  
table of contents require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in business and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and  to the extent of our outstanding debt under our floating rate debt facilities  the impact of increases in interest rates 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  borrow sufficient funds to service our debt  or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  then  due to borrowing base restrictions  increased letter of credit requirements  or otherwise  we may be required to sell additional assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  or obtain additional financing 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do any of these things on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we presently have senior subordinated ratings of b from moody s investor services and b from standard poor s 
at the present time  we have no indication from these agencies that they intend to change these ratings in the near future 
cash flow from operations our operating cash flows increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in net earnings before depreciation and amortization  amortization of financing costs  deferred income taxes  and net gain loss on disposal write down of assets in this increase was offset in part by the use of cash in related to changes in working capital items while cash was provided by working capital items in our cash flow from operations depends primarily on producing and selling quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
in recent years  crude oil costs and prices of refined products have fluctuated substantially 
these costs and prices depend on numerous factors  including the supply of and demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  changes in the economy  changes in the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products  worldwide political conditions  the extent of government laws  and local factors  including market conditions  pipeline capacity  and the level of operations of other refineries in our markets 
our crude oil requirements are supplied from sources that include major oil companies  large independent producers  and smaller local producers 
except for our long term supply agreement with 
table of contents statoil  our crude oil supply contracts are generally relatively short term contracts 
these contracts generally contain market responsive pricing provisions 
an increase in crude oil prices could adversely affect our operating margins if we are unable to pass along the increased cost of raw materials to our customers 
our sale prices for refined products are influenced by the commodity price of crude oil 
generally  an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil results in a corresponding increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products 
the timing of the relative movement of the prices  however  as well as the overall change in product prices  could reduce profit margins and could have a significant impact on our refining and marketing operations  earnings  and cash flows 
in addition  we maintain inventories of crude oil  intermediate products  and refined products  the values of which are subject to rapid fluctuation in market prices 
price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the manufactured refined products could have a significant effect on our operating results 
any long term adverse relationships between costs and prices could impact our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows to meet our working capital needs 
furthermore  because of the significantly greater volume of products produced and sold by our yorktown refinery  as compared to our other refining operations  we have a much larger exposure to volatile refining margins than we had in the past 
moreover  the industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are large  integrated oil companies which  because of their more diverse operations  larger refineries  stronger capitalization and better brand name recognition  may be better able than we are to withstand volatile industry conditions  including shortages or excesses of crude oil or refined products or intense price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
because some of our competitors refineries are larger and more efficient than the our refineries  these refineries may have lower per barrel crude oil refinery processing costs 
our ability to borrow funds under our current revolving credit facility could be adversely impacted by low product prices that could reduce the borrowing base related to eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
in addition  the structuring of the statoil supply agreement will result in a lower availability of funds under the borrowing base calculation of our credit facility  but because of the terms of the statoil agreement  our borrowing needs will be reduced 
our debt instruments also contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to borrow funds if certain thresholds are not maintained 
see the discussion above in capital structure for further information relating to these loan covenants 
we anticipate that working capital  including that necessary for capital expenditures and debt service  will be funded through existing cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  existing credit facilities  and  if necessary  future financing arrangements 
future liquidity  both short and long term  will continue to be primarily dependent on producing or purchasing  and selling  sufficient quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
based on the current operating environment for all of our operations  we believe that we will have sufficient working capital to meet our needs over the next month period 
working capital working capital at december  consisted of current assets of  and current liabilities of  or a current ratio of at december   the current ratio was  with current assets of  and current liabilities of  current assets have increased since december  by  primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable have increased primarily due to higher trade receivables  due in part to higher finished product selling prices 
the receipt of  of income tax refunds in partially offset these account receivable increases 

table of contents inventories have increased primarily due to increases in refinery onsite crude oil volumes  primarily at yorktown  increases in crude oil and refined product prices  increases in yorktown  terminal  and phoenix fuel refined product volumes  and increases in retail merchandise inventories 
these increases were offset  in part  by decreases in refined product volumes at the four corners refineries and retail operations 
current liabilities have increased since december  by  primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable have increased primarily due to higher raw material and finished product costs 
accrued expenses have increased primarily as a result of higher fuel taxes payable and accruals for management incentive bonuses 
capital expenditures and resources net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures totaled approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  expenditures for primarily were for turnaround expenditures at the yorktown refinery and operational and environmental projects for the refineries and retail operations 
expenditures in were primarily for turnaround expenditures for the ciniza and bloomfield refineries  financial accounting software upgrades  and operational and environmental projects for the refineries and retail operations 
we received proceeds of approximately  from the sale of property  plant and equipment and other assets in and  in proceeds received in primarily were from the sale of our corporate headquarters building and approximately acres of surrounding land  the sale of our travel center  and the sale of nine service station convenience stores 
proceeds received in were primarily from the sale of service station convenience stores and vacant land 
in connection with the sale of our headquarters building and surrounding land  we entered into a ten year agreement to leaseback the building 
a gain on the sale of this property of approximately  has been deferred and is being amortized over the original lease term 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell acres of vacant land known as the jomax property 
under the current terms of the agreement this transaction would close in the second quarter of we continue to monitor and evaluate our assets and may sell additional non strategic or underperforming assets that we identify as circumstances allow 
we also continue to evaluate potential acquisitions in our strategic markets  including lease arrangements 
on may   we acquired the yorktown refinery from bp corporation north america inc and bp products north america inc 
for  plus  for inventories  the assumption of certain liabilities  and a conditional earn out  the maximum amount of which cannot exceed  we also incurred transaction costs of approximately  in connection with the acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for a more detailed discussion of this transaction 
we financed our yorktown refinery acquisition and the refinancing of our  of senior subordinated notes due  with the proceeds from our  of senior subordinated notes due  our revolving credit facility  our mortgage loan facility and cash on hand 
we also paid approximately  of financing fees to various financial institutions in connection with these financing arrangements 
as part of the yorktown acquisition  we agreed to pay earn out payments  up to a maximum of  to the sellers  beginning in and concluding at the end of based upon certain market value factors 
for the year ended december   we paid  in earn outs under the 
table of contents purchase agreement 
for a further discussion of these earn out payments see note to our consolidated financial statements in item following the acquisition of our yorktown refinery  we developed a debt reduction strategy with the goal of reducing indebtedness by  prior to year end the goal was to be accomplished by managing inventory to a lower level  reducing non essential capital expenditures  and selling non core and or underperforming assets 
although we did not reach our goal in  the strategy was carried forward into the result of the debt reduction strategy follows reduction reduction total reduction revolving credit facility term loan capital lease obligations total these reductions were paid from operating cash flows and the proceeds from the sale of assets described above 
in prior years  we initiated two capital projects relating to our four corners refinery operations  and capitalized costs associated with these projects of approximately  in the third quarter of  we completed an ongoing evaluation of these projects and wrote off  of capitalized costs relating to one project after determining that it was no longer viable 
we determined that the other project was potentially still viable and will continue to monitor it 
we have budgeted for up to approximately  for capital expenditures in excluding any potential acquisitions 
of this amount  approximately  is for the completion of projects that were started in in addition  approximately  is budgeted for non discretionary projects that are required by law or regulation or to maintain the physical integrity of existing assets 
these expenditures are primarily for operational and environmental projects at our existing refineries  including approximately  for various processing unit turnarounds at our ciniza refinery  and replacements and upgrades for our retail operations 
another  is budgeted for discretionary projects to sustain or enhance the current level of operations  increase earnings associated with existing or new business and to expand existing operations 
this amount includes  for our retail operations to be used to build one new unit and for operational and service upgrades for other units 
the remaining budget of  is for discretionary growth projects 
this amount includes  for various upgrades at our yorktown refinery to handle the crude oil we will be receiving under our recently announced long term supply contract 
our budget also includes  for capital expenditure contingencies 
in future years  we will be making substantial capital expenditures for government mandated environmental projects  including the low sulfur fuel requirements discussed previously 
see discussions under the caption regulatory  environmental and other matters included in items and for more details of these projects and below under the caption clean fuels and consent decree expenditures 
we continue to investigate other capital improvements to our existing facilities 
the amount of capital projects that are actually undertaken in will depend on  among other things  general business conditions and results of operations 
much of the capital currently budgeted for environmental compliance is integrally related to operations or to operationally required projects 
we do not specifically identify capital expenditures related to such projects on the basis of whether they are for environmental as opposed to economic purposes 
with 
table of contents respect to capital expenditures budgeted primarily to satisfy environmental regulations  we estimate that the following amounts were spent  and we anticipate that approximately  will be spent in primarily to satisfy environmental regulations 
with respect to our operating expenses for environmental compliance  while records are not kept specifically identifying or allocating such expenditures  we believe that we incur significant operating expense for such purposes 
changes in the tax laws and changes in federal and state environmental laws also may increase future capital and operating expenditure levels 
long term commitments included in the table below is a list of our obligations to make future payments under contracts and other agreements  as well as certain other contingent commitments 
payments due all remaining total years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations raw material purchases finished product purchases services total other long term obligations aggregate environmental reserves pension obligations aggregate litigation reserves interest obligations total total obligations excluding original issue discount 
the amounts set out in the table  including payment dates  are our best estimates at this time  but may vary as circumstances change or we become aware of additional facts 
raw material and finished product purchases were determined by multiplying contract volumes by the price determined under the contract as of december   or if the contract was not in effect at december   as if the contract was in effect as of december  the contracts underlying these calculations all have variable pricing arrangements 
the above table does not include amounts for outstanding purchase orders at december   amounts under contracts that are cancelable by either party upon giving notice  and amounts under agreements that are based on a percentage of sales  such as credit card processing fees 

table of contents we cannot estimate our future pension expenditures beyond we are obligated to make a lump sum payment to the pension retirement plan each year 
not included in the table are certain retiree medical and asset retirement obligations for which annual funding is not required 
our asset retirement obligations are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements in item and our pension plan and retiree medical plan obligations are described in more detail in note the indentures governing our notes and our credit facility and loan facility contain restrictive covenants and other terms and conditions that if not maintained  if violated  or if certain conditions are met  could result in default  early redemption of the notes  affect our ability to borrow funds  make certain payments  or engage in certain activities 
a default under any of the notes  the credit facility or the loan facility could cause such debt  and by reason of cross default provisions  our other debt to become immediately due and payable 
included in the table below is a list of our commitments under our revolving credit facility 
amount of commitment expiration all remaining other commercial commitments total years in thousands line of credit including standby letters of credit standby letters of credit standby letters of credit reduce the availability of funds for direct borrowings under the line of credit 
at december  there were no direct borrowings under the line of credit 
we purchase crude oil and other feedstocks from a number of suppliers to operate our refineries 
we acquire the feedstocks for our yorktown refinery from a number of domestic and international suppliers 
as to yorktown  we have not historically participated in these markets  and as such  have not had a credit relationship with these suppliers 
several of these suppliers required us to provide letters of credit for either a portion or the full amount of our purchases  due to the weak economy and the poor profitability experienced by refiners and marketers  including ourselves  throughout due to our improved financial condition and the overall improvement in our refining fundamentals in  we will be working with these suppliers to reduce or eliminate these letter of credit requirements 
the availability of letters of credit under our credit facility is  our inability to post satisfactory letters of credit could constrain our ability to purchase feedstocks on the most beneficial terms 
clean fuels and consent decree expenditures see discussions under the caption regulatory  environmental and other matters included in items and and note to our consolidated financial statements in item for more details of these projects 
the following table shows amounts we anticipate spending to meet certain clean fuel regulations and to comply with an environmental consent decree that requires certain actions to be taken at our yorktown refinery 
the table does not include amounts for which environmental accruals have been established  which are instead included in the long term commitments table above 
these amounts are our best estimates at this time  but may vary as circumstances change or we become aware of additional facts 
projected capital expenditures amount yorktown clean fuels four corners clean fuels rfi cms sewer system yorktown consent decree total anticipated cash obligations 
table of contents the amounts shown in the above table are the high end of our estimated costs for these projects 
we anticipate that the costs could be between the following ranges yorktown clean fuels  to  four corners clean fuels  to  rfi cms sewer system  to  consent decree  to  cash requirements we believe we will have sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  including that necessary for capital expenditures and debt service  over the next month period because of an improved operating environment for all of our operations  current cash balances  availability of funds under our revolving credit facility  and compliance with our debt covenants 
in order to create additional flexibility and to assist us in meeting future anticipated expenditures  we are in the process of evaluating a number of strategies to further reduce debt and interest expense 
until these strategies are implemented  we will use operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to meet our commitments 
stock repurchases and dividends our board of directors had previously authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
this share repurchase program was discontinued in over the life of the program we repurchased  shares for approximately  resulting in a weighted average cost of approximately per share 
the repurchased shares are treated as treasury shares and are available for a number of corporate purposes including  among other things  for options  bonuses  and other employee stock benefit plans 
we currently do not pay dividends on our common stock 
the board of directors will periodically review our policy regarding the payment of dividends 
any future dividends are subject to the results of our operations  declaration by the board of directors  and existing debt covenants 

table of contents related party transactions in the past  we engaged in a number of transactions with related parties  primarily james e 
acridge  our former chairman  president and chief executive officer the former ceo 
certain of these transactions are summarized in the table below 
material related party transactions transaction purchase of jomax real property n a n a  purchase of jomax rights n a n a  purchase of artwork for corporate headquarters n a n a  purchase of stock n a n a  principal amount of loan receivable at the end of each year n a n a  interest income on loan n a n a  interest receivable at n a n a  other receivables at n a n a  other amounts classified as compensation n a n a  other receipts n a n a  for a discussion of the matters included in the above table  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item excluded from the above table are a number of immaterial transactions involving ourselves and our former ceo or entities controlled  or previously controlled  by our former ceo  including amounts paid to us for purchases of fuel  payments made to entities controlled  or previously controlled  by our former ceo for events held at facilities owned by such entities  reimbursements for certain landscaping and maintenance services provided for our former ceo and entities controlled  or previously controlled  by our former ceo  and the value of products and services provided to us by our former ceo or entities controlled  or previously controlled  by him 
various immaterial amounts involving other related parties are also excluded from the table 
additionally  in  we extended for one year the period of time that our former ceo had to exercise a grant of  stock options 
these stock options were due to expire on june  due to our former ceo s termination on march  because the extension changed the terms of the original stock option grant under our stock incentive plan  we recorded compensation expense in the amount of all of the material foregoing transactions were reviewed and approved by our board of directors or committees of the board 
as discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  our former ceo  and three entities controlled by our former ceo  have commenced chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
we are pursuing claims in the bankruptcy proceedings for  among other things  the following the loan and related interest discussed above  the other receivables outstanding discussed above  approximately  of costs incurred through december  to resolve a lease dispute and related litigation in which an entity controlled by our former ceo was a sublessee of ours and a limited liability company in which the bankruptcy estate of an entity controlled by mr 
acridge formerly owned a interest is the landlord costs incurred subsequent to december  also will be pursued  approximately  for the time spent by an employee of ours on projects for entities controlled  or previously controlled  by our former ceo  
table of contents approximately  for landscaping services provided by our employees that benefited our former ceo  approximately  for what we believe are non company expenses incurred by our former ceo on one of our credit cards  and approximately  of other miscellaneous amounts 
we do not know whether  and to what extent  creditors  including ourselves  will receive any recovery on their respective debts from any of the four bankruptcy estates 
in addition  with respect to the lease dispute described above  we have demanded reimbursement of amounts paid to resolve the dispute from an entity controlled by our former ceo that is not involved in bankruptcy 
we do not know whether we will receive any of the amounts we are attempting to recover 
risk management we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these normal business exposures  we may  from time to time  use commodity futures and options contracts to reduce price volatility  to fix margins in our refining and marketing operations  and to protect against price declines associated with our crude oil and finished products inventories 
our policies for the use of derivative financial instruments set limits on quantities  require various levels of approval and require review and reporting procedures 
in and  we entered into various crude oil and gasoline futures contracts to economically hedge crude oil and other inventories and purchases for our yorktown refinery operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized losses on these contracts of approximately  in cost of products sold 
for the year ended december   we recognized losses on similar contracts of approximately  these transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and accordingly were marked to market each month 
there were no open crude oil futures contracts or other commodity derivative contracts at december  our credit facility is floating rate debt tied to various short term indices 
as a result  our annual interest costs associated with this debt may fluctuate 
at december   there were no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility 
our loan facility is floating rate debt tied to various short term indices 
as a result  our annual interest costs associated with this debt may fluctuate 
at december   there was  outstanding under this facility 
the potential increase in annual interest expense from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on these borrowings at december   would be approximately  our operations are subject to the normal hazards  including fire  explosion and weather related perils 
we maintain various insurance coverages  including business interruption insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
we are not fully insured against some risks because some risks are not fully insurable  coverage is unavailable or premium costs  in our judgment  do not justify such expenditures 
credit risk with respect to customer receivables is concentrated in the geographic areas in which we operate and relates primarily to customers in the oil and gas industry 
to minimize this risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial position and require collateral  such as letters of credit  in certain circumstances 
other federal  state and local laws relating to the environment  health and safety affect nearly all of our operations 
as is the case with other companies engaged in similar industries  we face significant exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental  health and safety matters 
these 
table of contents matters include soil and water contamination  air pollution and personal injuries or property damage allegedly caused by substances made  handled  used  released or disposed of by us or by our predecessors 
various laws govern the investigation and remediation of contamination at our current and former properties  as well as at third party sites to which we sent wastes for disposal 
we may be held liable for contamination existing at our current or former properties even though a prior operator of the site  or other third party  caused the contamination 
we also may be held responsible for costs associated with contamination cleanup at third party disposal sites even if the original disposal activities met all applicable regulatory requirements at the time 
we are now engaged in a number of these remediation projects 
our future expenditures for compliance with environmental  health and safety matters cannot be estimated in many circumstances for various reasons 
these reasons include the speculative nature of remediation and cleanup cost estimates and methods  imprecise and conflicting data regarding the hazardous nature of various substances  the number of other potentially responsible parties involved  defenses that may be available to us  and changing environmental  health and safety laws  including changing interpretations of these laws 
we cannot give assurance that compliance with laws  investigations  enforcement proceedings  private party claims  or cleanup requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
for a further discussion of environmental  health and safety matters affecting our operations  see the discussion of these matters contained in items and under the heading regulatory  environmental and other matters 
rules and regulations implementing federal  state and local laws relating to the environment  health and safety will continue to affect our operations 
we cannot predict what new environmental  health or safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or enforced with respect to our products or activities 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies  could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results and could require substantial expenditures by us for  among other things the installation and operation of refinery equipment  pollution control systems and other equipment not currently possessed by us  the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities  and the initiation or modification of cleanup activities 

table of contents as of december  and  we had environmental liability accruals of approximately  and  respectively  and litigation accruals of approximately  and  respectively 
the environmental liability accruals summarized in the table below are recorded in the current and long term sections of our consolidated balance sheets

summary of accrued environmental contingencies as of increase as of increase as of decrease payments decrease payments in thousands farmington refinery ciniza land treatment facility bloomfield tank farm old terminal ciniza solid waste management units bloomfield refinery ciniza well closures retail service stations various east outfall bloomfield yorktown refinery totals we have a cash balance retirement plan and a retiree medical plan for the employees of our yorktown refinery 
these plans contain many of the same features of plans that were in place for the employees of the former owners 
all yorktown employees meeting the eligibility requirements are automatically included in the cash plan 
we must make a lump sum payment to the cash plan each year 
the medical plan is a defined post retirement benefit plan 
the medical plan will pay a percentage of the medical premium for coverage under the plan 
coverage is available to full time yorktown employees who are age or older with or more years of service 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a more detailed discussion of these plans 
as previously discussed  lawsuits have been filed in over states alleging that mtbe  a blendstock used by many refiners in producing specially formulated gasoline  has contaminated water wells 
for a discussion of mtbe lawsuits filed against us  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item  captioned commitments and contingences 
in february  we filed a complaint against the united states in the united states court of federal claims in connection with military jet fuel that we sold to the defense energy support center from through we asserted that the federal government underpaid us for jet fuel by approximately  for a discussion of this matter  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item  captioned commitments and contingencies 
our ciniza and bloomfield refineries primarily process a mixture of high gravity  low sulfur crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids 
the locally produced  high quality crude oil known as four corners sweet is the primary feedstock for these refineries 
our current projections of four corners crude oil production indicate that our crude oil demand will exceed the crude oil supply that is available from local sources for the foreseeable future 
we expect to operate the ciniza and bloomfield refineries at lower levels than otherwise would be scheduled as a result of shortfalls in four corners crude oil production 
for a further discussion of raw material supply for our refineries  see the discussion contained in items and under the heading raw material supply 

table of contents we are aware of a number of actions  proposals or industry discussions regarding product pipeline projects that could impact portions of our marketing areas 
the completion of some or all of these projects would result in increased competition by increasing the amount of refined products potentially available in our markets  as well as improving competitor access to these areas 
it also could result in new opportunities for us  as we are a net purchaser of refined products in some of these areas 
for a further discussion of the potential impact of pipeline projects on our operations  as well as other competitive factors affecting these operations  see the discussion of competitive factors contained in items and under the heading competitive conditions 
our refining activities are conducted at our two refinery locations in new mexico and the yorktown refinery in virginia 
these refineries constitute a significant portion of our operating assets  and the two new mexico refineries supply a significant portion of our retail operations 
as a result  our operations would be significantly interrupted if any of the refineries were to experience a major accident  be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster  or otherwise be forced to shut down 
if any of the refineries were to experience an interruption in supply or operations  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected
