item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes that are included with this report 
also  the discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates in this section is an integral part of the analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
overview concur technologies  inc is a leading provider of business services and software solutions that automate processes involved in the management of corporate expenses 
our core purpose is to use innovation to help our customers drive down their costs associated with corporate expense management 
our solutions are designed to automate and streamline business processes  reduce operating costs  improve internal controls  and empower businesses to apply greater insight to their spending patterns through comprehensive analytics 
our flagship products are our concur expense services and software for automating the travel and entertainment expense management process 
we also offer value added services and software that are integrated with our core software and services  as well as consulting  customer support and training for our customers 
concur expense and related services represented greater than of our total revenues in fiscal  and we offer our solutions under flexible delivery models that range from highly configurable to standardized offerings 
we sell our solutions primarily as subscription services  and  to a lesser extent  through our on premises license agreements 
we market and sell our solutions worldwide through a direct sales organization and indirect distribution channels 
we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services  consulting services  and the sale of software licenses 
subscription revenues have grown significantly as a percentage of our total revenues  to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this growth reflects our strategic shift to emphasize sales of subscription services rather than license sales 
generally  our subscription services revenues are recognized over the time period we provide our services to customers  in contrast to license revenues  which typically are recognized upon software delivery to the customer 
we believe that our strategic shift to the business services model provides more stable and predictable revenues and operating results compared to prior years when our license revenues were more significant than our subscription services revenues 
from the time we began selling expense management software in we offered our products under a traditional software license model 
in  we began offering concur expense as a subscription service and  since that time  we have increasingly focused our business on providing our solutions under a subscription delivery model 
we continue to sell licensed software and support license customers  and will continue to do so in the future 
our strategic focus in fiscal is to grow our core subscription business and related market share of our offerings and to reduce our cost of deploying and operating services 
we expect our subscription revenues to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  due to anticipated demand for our subscription services and lower sales of license software 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflecting increased direct sales headcount  to support expected demand and create additional awareness in our target market 
we operate in and report on one segment corporate expense management software and services 

table of contents selected financial data in the following table  we show financial data derived from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended september  revenues subscription consulting license total revenues expenses cost of operations sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible asset acquisition and restructuring charges total expenses income loss from operations other income  net net income loss results of operations revenues year ended september  change change dollars in thousands subscription consulting license total revenues subscription revenues 
subscription revenues consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services offerings  the amortization of set up fees paid to us in connection with those services  the amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements  and in some multiple element subscription arrangements  where there is no vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered subscription element  the amortized portion of the related license and consulting fees 
subscription revenues are affected by pricing  number of new customers  customer contract durations  and our customer retention rate 
subscription revenues increased by in fiscal over fiscal revenues from our subscription services total subscription revenues less revenue from the amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements contributed approximately of the absolute dollar increase in subscription revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal continued expansion of our customer base for outsourced subscription services was the main reason for the increase 
the larger customer base reflects a trend of increased market demand for our subscription services and strong retention of existing subscription customers 
we believe this trend was related primarily to the market s continued and growing acceptance of outsourced services  driven by limited information technology capital budgets  which make traditional self hosted software license arrangements  with their substantial up front costs  less attractive compared with subscription services 

table of contents subscription revenues increased by in fiscal over fiscal revenues from our subscription services contributed approximately of the absolute dollar increase in subscription revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in subscription revenues reflects expansion of our existing customer base for outsourced subscription services due to the factors described above for fiscal  and to our july acquisition of captura software  inc captura  which provided us a large base of existing subscription based clients 
we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting  including captura s results in our consolidated statement of operations beginning august  we expect subscription revenues to continue to grow in fiscal  on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  as a result of the growing demand for our subscription service offerings and our planned increase in spending on sales and marketing in fiscal compared to fiscal consulting revenues 
consulting revenues consist of fees for client services  which include system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
consulting revenues are affected by the number of and complexity of implementations 
recognized consulting revenues are also affected by circumstances in which consulting fees in multiple element arrangements require deferral or are deemed to be subscription related 
the decrease in consulting revenues in fiscal from fiscal  was due in part to the deferral of revenues totaling approximately million in fiscal relating to consulting services performed under contracts signed in fiscal through certain strategic resellers  which are required to be recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contracts  due to the structure of those customer contracts 
the decrease was also attributable to fewer new license customers added  due to our shift to a business services model discussed above  and to fewer upgrades and enhancements for existing customers during fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease in consulting revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower demand for our consulting services resulting from a decrease in new license sales in fiscal  compared to fiscal we anticipate that consulting revenues in fiscal will fluctuate on a quarterly basis but be higher for the fiscal year compared to fiscal  as a result of the demand for our services and software and the timing of upgrades and enhancements to our solutions 
license revenues 
license revenues consist of fees earned from sales of our software licenses 
the decrease in license revenues for fiscal  compared to fiscal and the decrease in license revenues for fiscal  compared to fiscal reflect the continued shift from our licensed model to our subscription services model 
we expect the absolute dollar value of license revenues to decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting the market s continued shift in demand from a licensed model to a subscription services model 
international revenues 
revenues from customers outside the united states were million of total revenues  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
we expect our international revenues to grow in the near term  as our products and services continue to gain acceptance in international markets  due in part to the expansion of international functionality within our solutions 

table of contents expenses year ended september  change change dollars in thousands cost of operations sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets in process research and development total expenses cost of operations 
cost of operations expenses primarily consist of salaries and related expenses including travel related expenses and allocated overhead costs which include depreciation  occupancy  insurance  telecommunications  and computer equipment expenses associated with employees and contractors who provide our subscription and consulting services 
cost of operations expenses also include co location and related telecommunications costs  fees paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements  royalties  and amortization of deferred set up costs we incur in connection with our subscription services 
cost of operations expenses represented of total revenues in fiscal compared with for fiscal despite a decline in license revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  cost of operations expenses  for our subscription and consulting services combined  decreased to of the related revenues in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due in part to improvements in our solutions and implementation methodology  which now enable us to provide our subscription and consulting services more efficiently  and the increase in new sales of our subscription services for which implementation costs are deferred and amortized 
total salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs increased for fiscal compared to fiscal co location and related telecommunications costs decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to our consolidation of existing co location facilities 
fees paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements  and royalties decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease reflected lower royalties for sub licensing third party software expense  due primarily to lower license sales  offset in part by an increase in reseller partner fees for subscription based sales 
cost of operations expenses as a percentage of total revenues were for the fiscal year ended september  compared with for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the increase in our subscription revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal relative to the increase in operating expenses and additional investment costs to support then current and expected subscription business 
total salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal co location and related telecommunications costs increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  to support existing and anticipated growth in our subscription business 
fees paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements  and royalties increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to increases in reseller partner fees for subscription based sales 
we expect total cost of operations expenses to remain relatively constant or decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues in compared to fiscal as we continue to deploy and support additional new customers and invest amounts necessary to meet future demand  consistent with our overall growth plans 
our expectation is that over time our cost of operations will decline as a percentage of revenues  as the cost to deploy and support each new customer decreases due to the leverage economies of scale anticipated in our subscription service model infrastructure 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including sales commissions and travel related expenses and allocated overhead costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel  and  to a lesser extent  miscellaneous sales and marketing costs  such as advertising  trade shows  and other promotional activities 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the total decrease in sales and marketing expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs  offset in part by an increase of in advertising costs 
the total decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs  and a decrease in costs for advertising  trade shows and other promotional activities 
we expect total sales and marketing expenses in fiscal to increase significantly in absolute dollars compared to fiscal  driven primarily by our expected increase in sales headcount compared to the level at september  a key part of our strategic focus in fiscal is to ensure our sales and marketing efforts support expected demand and create additional awareness in our target market 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses  and allocated overhead costs associated with employees and contractors engaged in software engineering  program management  and quality assurance 
research and development expenses were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal research and development expenses decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal capitalization of research and development costs  net of amortization  represented million of the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by an increase in personnel and allocated overhead costs totaling million in fiscal compared to fiscal this additional capitalization was primarily the result of our shift from developing licensed software for resale to developing software for internal use to support our subscription services offerings 
such development of internal use software requires the capitalization of related costs  as provided for under generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development expenses recognized decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that total research and development expenses in fiscal will increase moderately compared to fiscal as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs associated with employees and contractors in finance  human resources  legal  information technology  facilities  and  to a lesser extent  miscellaneous costs  such as professional fees and provision for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in total for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to an increase in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs of and an increase of in miscellaneous costs for fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of the increase in general and administrative expense is due to costs related to the growth of our business as well as increased public company compliance costs  including our compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses decreased in total for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to a decrease in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs of  offset in part by an increase of in miscellaneous costs for fiscal compared to fiscal we expect the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in personnel costs related to the growth of our business and a charge in the first quarter of fiscal for capitalized costs related to a proposed acquisition that concur had been evaluating but terminated during the quarter  as well as increased public company compliance costs  including our continued sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 

table of contents amortization of intangible asset 
amortization of intangible asset represents the allocation of the acquired customer base intangible asset from our july acquisition of captura 
this intangible asset is being ratably amortized as a non cash charge to operations over five years  consistent with the timing and level of the expected cash flows from the underlying acquired customer contracts 
in process research and development 
the expense for in process research and development consisted of a one time write off of acquired in process research and development costs totaling million relating to our july acquisition of captura 
other year ended september  change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense interest income and interest expense 
the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected higher levels of interest earning cash and cash equivalent investments  offset in part by lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected a lower level of interest earning cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the decreases in interest expense in both fiscal and compared to the respective prior year were due to lower average outstanding bank borrowings and capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded as we have accumulated significant net losses since inception  resulting in deferred tax assets 
since our utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits  which are not assured  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets 
financial condition our total assets were million and million at september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
this increase consisted primarily of increases in our cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and property and equipment at september  our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
our cash flow activity is described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
net property and equipment increased to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to additional purchases of computer equipment and software and investment in software used internally  both in connection with our subscription services offerings 
accounts receivable balances  net of allowances of million and million  were million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to a higher level of receivables from our subscription customers including increases in software maintenance renewals  due in turn to the growth of the subscription business 
our total current liabilities were million and million at september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was mainly due to an increase of million in the current portion of deferred revenues 
including the million increase in long term deferred revenues  total deferred revenues increased by million to million at september  from million at september  this increase resulted from the larger customer base for our subscription services offerings  as well as revenues deferred in fiscal resulting from the execution of contracts through certain strategic resellers during fiscal 
table of contents our common stock and additional paid in capital totaled million and million at september  and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase reflected proceeds received from the exercise of stock options under our stock based compensation plans and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources our available sources of liquidity as of september  consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we have a revolving credit line and equipment purchase facility available  which is discussed in more detail below 
our operating cash inflows consist of cash received from our subscription and license customers 
our operating cash outflows consist of cash payments to employees and vendors directly related to subscription and license customers  payments under arrangements with third parties who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with our subscription services offerings  related sales and marketing and administrative costs  and research and development costs 
operating activities provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and used million in fiscal the improvements in our operating cash flows in and were driven by profitable operating results and increases in deferred revenue balances 
our investing activities used million in fiscal and provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment totaled million in fiscal  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these amounts consisted mainly of computer equipment and software purchases  as well as amounts capitalized in fiscal for the development of software used internally  in connection with our subscription services offerings  as described in more detail in research and development above 
our financing activities provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and used million in fiscal proceeds from financing activities during these periods have consisted primarily of proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity  which we do not directly control  and from borrowings 
scheduled payments made on loans and capital leases are our primary cash outflows from financing activities 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement agreement with a bank for a million equipment credit facility term i advance 
the agreement for the term i advance allowed for borrowings in the amount of actual equipment purchases made through december as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the term i advance was approximately  bears interest at the bank s prime rate at september   and matures in december in september  we amended the terms of agreement to add captura as a borrower  and to include an additional term loan term ii advance of million  with the proceeds used to refinance certain indebtedness owed by captura to another creditor 
as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the term ii advance was approximately  bears interest at the bank s prime rate and matures in october there were no additional borrowings available under this additional term loan as of september  in september  we amended the terms of the agreement to add a revolving line of credit revolver in an amount not to exceed the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable or million  with interest at the bank s prime rate 
any advances under the revolver became due and payable on september  in september we amended the agreement to extend the revolver s availability to march   at which time any advances become due and payable 
the other terms of the revolver remain the same 
there were no amounts borrowed under the revolver at september  we also amended the terms of the agreement in september to add an additional equipment facility term iii advance for advances in the amount of actual equipment purchases up to million through 
table of contents september  with interest at the bank s prime rate  maturing september in september we amended the agreement to extend the term iii advance s availability to march   with any amounts borrowed due on march  the other terms of the term iii advance remain the same 
there were no amounts borrowed under the term iii advance at september  in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the premium for our current directors and officers liability insurance policy 
the loan under this financing agreement bears interest at and matures in december as of september   the balance under the arrangement was approximately  in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to one million shares of our outstanding stock over a two year period 
stock purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market based on market conditions 
any purchases will be made at the then current market prices  and repurchased shares will be retired 
no purchases have been made under this program through the date of this report 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september  related to long term debt  operating leases  and purchase obligations payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total in thousands long term debt obligations  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total reflects future minimum commitments under arrangements with third parties who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with the provision of our subscription services offerings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under our equipment credit facilities and revolving line of credit  as well as expected positive operating cash flows  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for normal business operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in the longer term  or if we decide to acquire assets or businesses  we may require additional funds and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of debt or equity securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
there can be no assurances that any such funds will be available or  if available  be on acceptable terms to meet our business needs 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 

table of contents the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  internal use software  allowances for accounts receivable  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services which include software maintenance services  consulting services  and the sale of software licenses 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
generally  we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 
in contractual arrangements that include the provision of multiple elements  we apply the accounting guidance most applicable to the specific arrangement to determine how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
multiple element arrangements require the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
generally  separate contracts with the same customer that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated together and  therefore  are accounted for as a single contractual arrangement in determining how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
typically  we measure and allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements based on their fair value or  if necessary  vendor specific objective evidence of their fair value vsoe 
vsoe is determined by the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price set by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change prior to separate market introduction 
subscription revenues our subscription revenues are typically recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer and consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services  amortization of related set up fees  amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements  and the amortized portion of the related license and consulting fees in certain multiple element subscription arrangements where vsoe does not exist for an undelivered subscription element 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual lives  or the expected lives of the customer relationships  which generally range from two to five years 
for those subscription service offerings that have been commercially available for only a short period of 
table of contents time  the contractual lives are used as the best estimate of the expected lives of the customer relationships 
we continue to evaluate and adjust the length of these amortization periods as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and contract cancellations 
it is possible that  in the future  the estimates of expected customer lives may change and  if so  the periods over which such subscription set up fees and costs are amortized will be adjusted 
any such change in estimated expected customer lives will affect our future results of operations 
software maintenance services include technical support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
fees for software maintenance services are typically billed annually in advance of performance with provisions for subsequent automatic annual renewals 
we defer the related revenues and recognize them ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which typically are one year 
subscription revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
consulting revenues consulting revenues consist of fees for professional services  which consist of system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
consulting service fees are typically billed and recognized as revenue on a time and materials basis 
in some instances  we sell consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts and  in such cases  recognize consulting revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
consulting revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
in service arrangements including both consulting and subscription services  but not a license of our software  we recognize consulting revenues as they are performed if the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting within the arrangement 
the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting if they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription services  and delivery or performance of the subscription services is considered probable and substantially within our control 
we have determined that  in our service arrangements of this type  the consulting services typically qualify as a separate unit of accounting and  accordingly  the consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if the consulting services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the related revenues are combined with the subscription revenues  and recognized ratably over the subscription service period 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
license revenues license revenues consist of fees earned from  and allocable to  grants of licenses to use our software products 
we recognize license revenues when evidence of a license arrangement exists  we have delivered the software  the amount of the transaction is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and vsoe exists for any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
elements included in our multiple element software arrangements consist of various licensed software products and services such as software maintenance services  consulting services  and subscription services 
in software license arrangements that include rights to multiple elements  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements using the residual method  under which revenues are allocated to undelivered elements based on vsoe and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered elements 
if sufficient vsoe does not exist for the allocation of revenue to the various elements of the arrangement  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
if the only undelivered element is software maintenance  the entire fee is recognized ratably as subscription revenue 
we are required to exercise judgment in deciding 
table of contents how to interpret the evidence of fair value to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration with respect to a given element  and in determining whether an established price is likely to change prior to separate market introduction 
these judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in software license arrangements where we also provide consulting services  license revenues generally are recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that the criteria for recognition of software license revenues described above are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
if we determine that the consulting services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees is dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  then both the license and consulting fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
we typically do not consider the consulting services we provide in such arrangements to be essential to the functionality of the software and  therefore  license revenues are typically recognized upon delivery of the software and consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
accordingly  our judgment as to whether consulting services should be considered essential to the functionality of the licensed software may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in arrangements where we license our software and also host the licensed software for our customer  a software element is only considered present if our customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and it is feasible for our customer to either operate the software on its own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 
if the arrangement meets these criteria  as well as the other criteria for recognition of license revenues described above  we recognize license revenues when the software is delivered  and the subscription hosting revenues are recognized as the hosting service is provided 
the hosting set up fees  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  are deferred and recognized ratably over the hosting service period 
if we determine that a separate software element as described above is not present  we combine the software license fees with the subscription hosting fees and recognize them ratably over the subscription service period  as subscription revenue 
our judgment as to whether we meet the criteria above could have a material affect on the timing and mix of our revenue recognition and on our results of operations 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
when we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the revenues on a gross basis  and amounts paid to our reseller partners are recognized as cost of operations 
our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  establish pricing of the arrangement  and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
when our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and cost of operations 
internal use software we capitalize certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with aicpa sop  accounting for the costs of corporate software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
we capitalize software development costs when application development begins  it is probable that the project will be completed  and the software will be used as intended 
costs associated with preliminary project stage activities  training  maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred 
our policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects  as well as external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalizable personnel costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects 
capitalized costs are ratably amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful lives of the related applications which typically range from three to five years 
our judgment as to which costs to capitalize  when to begin capitalizing  and what period to amortize the costs over may materially affect our results of operations 

table of contents accounts receivable allowances 
we record provisions for estimated sales allowances to subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and the current economic environment 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to continue to account for our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
accordingly  no stock based compensation cost has been reflected in our statement of operations for any of the periods presented  as all options granted under these plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and any purchase discounts under our employee stock purchase plan were within statutory limits 
if we are required to change our accounting for stock based compensation in the future to the fair value method  as currently proposed by the financial accounting standards board  we would incur and record substantial  non cash  stock based compensation expense  which would have a material effect on our results of operations 
the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
such judgments can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we have experienced significant operating losses to date  as well as assumed significant net operating loss carryforwards from acquisitions  both of which have resulted in significant net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to these deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until the point at which we believe future profitability is more than reasonably assured 
in the event we determine it is more likely than not we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to our valuation allowance would be recorded and may result in a reduction to goodwill  and or the recording of a significant tax benefit  which would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
depending on the amount of deferred tax assets that may be realized  and depending on whether we incur taxable profits in the periods following the recognition of any tax benefit  we may record tax expense in these subsequent periods 
any recorded tax expense would result in minimal actual tax payments until the point at which we fully utilized our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards  which are subject to the limitations and timing as described below 
as a result of prior equity financings and the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we have incurred ownership changes  as defined by applicable tax laws 
accordingly  our use of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
further  to the extent that any single year loss is not utilized to the full amount of the limitation  such unused loss is carried over to subsequent years until the earlier of its utilization or the expiration of the relevant carryforward period 
our net operating loss carryforwards may extend to a period of greater than years  subject to limitations and timing as prescribed by applicable tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents factors that may affect financial condition and results of operations we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves substantial risk and uncertainty 
the following discussion addresses the risks and uncertainties that could cause  or contribute to causing  actual results to differ materially from expectations 
in evaluating our business  readers should pay particular attention to the descriptions of risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this report and our other filings with the sec 
we are dependent upon sales of our concur expense solutions  which account for greater than of our total revenues 
if demand for these solutions was to decline materially  our results of operations would be substantially harmed 
we generated greater than of our total revenues in fiscal from our concur expense services and software  and we expect such services and software to continue to contribute a similar percentage of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance and revenue growth is dependent upon continued market acceptance of our concur expense solutions  and our revenues would decline significantly if  for example  our competitors  some of which have substantially greater resources than us  develop expense management products that achieve greater market acceptance  or we do not keep up with technological advancements in software platforms  delivery models or product features 
there can be no assurance that our services and software solutions will continue to maintain widespread market penetration or that we will continue to derive significant revenues from sales of such solutions in the future 
we are increasingly dependent on a subscription service business model which could fail to adequately support our business and operations 
our subscription revenues are based on a business model that has a limited history and continues to evolve  and  is therefore subject to a number of risks  including an increasing reliance on a relatively novel revenue model for our industry  a reduction of license revenues as we focus on building our subscription business  lower gross margins and higher fixed costs associated with our subscription business  as compared to our license business  unpredictable sales cycles  and the possibility of subscription cancellations 
we began offering our software as a service on an outsourced basis over the internet in our subscription services delivery models have continued to evolve and  today  we anticipate that our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in large part  upon the growth of our subscription services 
our subscription revenues represented of total revenues in fiscal  and we depend substantially on outsourced subscription services delivery models for our anticipated revenues and cash flows 
we anticipate that subscription revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues and that our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in large part  upon the growth in customer demand for our outsourced subscription services delivery models 
as such  we have invested significantly in infrastructure  operations  and strategic relationships to support these models  which represent a significant departure from the delivery strategies that we and other enterprise software vendors have traditionally employed 
our new and evolving business model makes our business operations and prospects difficult to evaluate 
our emphasis on building our subscription business has contributed to reduced software license revenues in recent periods 
our license revenues have declined substantially in recent periods  due in large part to the growth of our subscription services business  resulting in license revenues in fiscal that were lower than those in fiscal the limited history of our subscription business model makes it difficult to predict whether demand for subscription services will continue 
if it does not  we may not be able to generate sufficient license revenues to offset any decrease in sales of subscription services 
if our subscription services business does not grow sufficiently  our cost of revenues may exceed such revenues  which could harm our operating results 
our costs of providing subscription services are relatively fixed in the short term  so we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to offset any potential slowdown in subscription sales 
in addition  the cycle for implementing our subscription services can be 
table of contents unpredictable because our services must be integrated with a customer s existing systems 
any delays in implementation may prevent us from recognizing subscription revenue for periods of time  even when we have already incurred costs relating to the implementation of our subscription services 
furthermore  we may experience unanticipated increases in costs associated with providing our subscription services and software maintenance services to customers over the term of our customer contracts as a result of inflation  inaccurate internal cost projections or other factors  which may harm our operating results 
additionally  some of our subscription services contracts contain cancellation provisions  and  as a result  we may recognize substantially less revenue than the aggregate value of those contracts over their terms 
if a customer cancels or otherwise seeks to terminate a subscription or maintenance agreement prior to the end of its term  or if we are unable to renew such an agreement at the end of its term  our operating results in future periods could be substantially harmed 
we depend on consulting revenues  which may fluctuate or decline 
our consulting revenues represented of total revenues in fiscal we anticipate that consulting revenues will continue to represent a significant component of our total revenues 
the level of consulting revenues depends largely upon demand for our consulting services  which consist of system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
our consulting revenues could fluctuate or decline to the extent sales or upgrades of our subscription services and or software licenses fluctuate or decline or if third party organizations such as systems integrators compete with us for the installation or servicing of our offerings 
our ability to increase consulting revenues will depend in large part on our ability to increase the scale of our consulting organization  including our ability to recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified consulting personnel 
software license revenues are volatile  which makes our operating results difficult to predict 
our software license revenues represented of total revenues in fiscal while software license revenues are diminishing as a percent of total revenues  they continue to contribute to our overall operating results 
however  the timing and amounts of license revenues can be difficult to predict  which can lead to variability in operating results 
for example  our licensed software is typically shipped when orders are received  so license backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of the quarter s expected license revenues 
this makes license revenues in any quarter difficult to forecast because they are determined by orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  we have historically recognized a substantial percentage of license revenues in the last month of the quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter  and we expect this trend to continue for as long as our licensed software represents a meaningful part of our overall business 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues or any delay in the recognition of revenues could result in significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
furthermore we find it difficult to forecast quarterly license revenues because our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  is lengthy and varies substantially from customer to customer 
the continuing weakness of capital spending for enterprise software contributes to the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle for licensed products  making related revenues more difficult to predict and subjecting our operating results to greater volatility on a quarter over quarter basis 
we face significant competition from companies that have greater resources than us and if we fail to compete effectively  our business will suffer and be materially harmed 
the market for our solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the direct competition we face depends on the market segment focus and delivery model capabilities of our competitors 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and  at times  have to overcome their reluctance to move away from existing paper based systems 
our principal direct competition comes from independent vendors of corporate expense management software and services  as well as financial institutions and erp vendors that sell products similar to ours along with their suites of other products and services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger total number of customers for their products and services than we do 

table of contents some of our competitors  particularly major financial institutions and erp vendors  have well established relationships with our current and potential customers as well as with systems integrators and other vendors and service providers 
these competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products  than us 
in addition  we anticipate the entrance of new competitors in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and change in market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are dependent upon strategic relationships with third parties and if we cannot continue to sustain and develop these relationships  our revenues will decline 
we depend on strategic reseller and referral relationships to offer products and services to a larger customer base than we can reach through direct sales  telesales  and internal marketing efforts 
if we were unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or enter into additional strategic relationships  we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution  sales  and marketing of our products and services 
our success depends in part on the ultimate success of our strategic reseller and referral partners and their ability to market our products and services successfully 
our existing strategic referral partners are not obligated to refer any potential customers to us 
in addition  some of these third parties have entered  and may continue to enter  into strategic relationships with our competitors 
further  many of our strategic partners have multiple strategic relationships  and they may not regard us as significant for their businesses 
our strategic partners may terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products or services 
our strategic partners also may interfere with our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships 
if our customers have concerns over the scalability or security of our products  they may not continue to buy our products and our revenues will decline 
if customers determine that our subscription services offerings are not sufficiently scalable  do not provide adequate security for the dissemination of information over the internet or corporate extranets  or are otherwise inadequate for internet or extranet use or if  for any other reason  customers fail to accept our subscription services for use  our business will be harmed 
as part of our subscription services  we receive credit card  travel booking  employee  purchasing  supplier  and other financial and accounting data  through the internet or extranets  and there can be no assurance that this information will not be subject to computer break ins  theft  and other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information for which we are responsible 
any such lapse in security could expose us to litigation  loss of customers  or other harm to our business 
in addition  any person who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any general concern regarding security in the marketplace could deter customers or prospects from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
our failure to prevent security breaches  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
privacy concerns are increasing  which could result in regulatory changes that may harm our business 
personal privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and many other countries in which we operate 
the united states and various other countries have recommended limitations on  or taken actions to limit  the use of personal information by those collecting such information 
any new or existing privacy laws  if applicable to our business  could impose additional costs and could limit our use and disclosure of such information 
if such privacy laws were deemed to apply to us  we may be required to change our activities and revise or eliminate our services  which could significantly harm our business 

table of contents interruption of our operations could significantly harm our business 
significant portions of our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our computer equipment  offices  and hosting facilities against damage from earthquake  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  and other events 
we back up software and related data files regularly and store the back up files at various off site locations 
however  there can be no assurance that our disaster preparedness will eliminate the risk of extended interruption of our operations 
we have engaged third party hosting facility providers to provide the hosting facilities and related infrastructure for our subscription services 
these hosting facilities are located in several locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
we do not control the operation of these hosting facilities 
despite precautions taken at these facilities  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by one of our hosting providers to close a facility without adequate notice to us  or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
we also retain third party telecommunications providers to provide internet and direct telecommunications connections for our services 
any of these third party providers may fail to perform their obligations adequately 
any damage to  or failure of  our systems could result in interruptions in our service and or litigation 
interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue  cause us to issue credits or pay penalties  cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates 
our business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
gaap is subject to interpretation by the fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
in particular  revenue recognition rules for software and service companies are complex and require significant interpretation by us 
changes in circumstances  interpretations  or accounting principles or guidance may require us to modify our revenue recognition policies 
such modifications could impact the timing of revenue recognition and our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our critical revenue recognition policies 
further  we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee s stock option exercise price is equal to or exceeds the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date 
however  the fasb is expected to release its final standard requiring the expensing of stock based compensation under the fair value method in the near future 
if the final standard is released in its currently proposed form  we would incur and record significant  non cash based  stock compensation expense  which would have a material effect on our results of operations 
for example  in fiscal  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans using a fair value method prescribed under fasb statement no 
 as amended by statement no 
 our net income would have been reduced by million 
compliance with new regulations governing public company corporate governance and reporting is uncertain and expensive 
many new laws  regulations  and standards  notably those adopted in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of by the sec  the new york stock exchange  and the nasdaq stock market  impose new obligations on public companies  such as ours  which have increased the scope  complexity  and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practices and have created uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
our continuing preparation for and implementation of these reforms and enhanced new disclosures has resulted in  and will 
table of contents likely continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment  which will be required for our fiscal year ending september   has required  and will likely continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
any unanticipated difficulties in preparing for and implementing these reforms could result in material delays in complying with these new laws  regulations  and standards or significantly increase our costs 
our ability to fully comply with these new laws and regulations is also uncertain 
our failure to timely prepare for and implement the reforms required by these new laws  regulations  and standards could significantly harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
further  these laws  regulations  and standards may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors and board committees  particularly our audit committee  and to attract and retain qualified executive officers  which could harm our business 
if our efforts to comply with new laws  regulations  and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
the growth of the international component of our business subjects us to additional risks associated with foreign operations 
our international operations  which are subject to risks associated with operating abroad  are becoming an increasingly important component of our business 
revenues from customers outside the united states represented approximately million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including costs of customizing products for foreign countries  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  uncertain regulation of electronic commerce  compliance with multiple  conflicting  and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  import and export restrictions and tariffs  potentially weaker protection for our intellectual property than in the united states  and practical difficulties in enforcing such rights abroad  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and political and economic instability 
our international operations also face foreign currency related risks 
to date  most of our revenues have been denominated in united states dollars  but we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently do not engage in foreign exchange hedging activities and  therefore our international revenues and expenses are currently subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  our ability to expand into international markets will depend on our ability to develop and support services and products that incorporate the tax laws  accounting practices  and currencies of applicable countries 
our international operations also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign 
table of contents countries might attempt to regulate our services and products or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business in international markets 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales and marketing activities and enter into relationships with additional international distribution partners 
we are in the early stages of developing our indirect distribution channels in markets outside the united states 
we may not be able to attract and retain distribution partners that will be able to market our products effectively 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations of investors and public market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance 
if quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the evolving demand for our services and software  spending decisions by our customers and prospective customers  our ability to manage expenses  the timing of new product releases  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the timing of execution of large contracts  changes in mix of our services and software offerings  the mix of sales channels through which our services and software are sold  costs of developing new products and enhancements  our ability to adequately provide services and software  and global economic and political conditions 
in addition  due to the continuing weakness of capital spending for enterprise software and business services  we believe that many existing and potential customers may reassess or reduce their planned technology and internet related investments and defer or reprioritize purchasing decisions 
any such reduction in business spending for technology could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
as a result  there is increased uncertainty with respect to our expected revenues 
our lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our financial results 
because of the high costs involved over a significant period of time  customers for enterprise software and business services typically commit significant resources to an evaluation of available solutions and require us to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of our services and software 
our sales cycle  which is the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale  is often lengthy and unpredictable 
as a result  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and size of specific sales 
in addition  customers may delay their purchases from a given quarter to another as they elect to wait for new product enhancements or due to other factors 
any delay in completing  or failure to complete  sales in a particular quarter or fiscal year could harm our business and could cause our operating results to vary significantly 

table of contents we may not successfully develop or introduce new products or enhancements to existing products  and  as a result  we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers and our revenues would suffer 
our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in part  upon the successful development  introduction  and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services  and our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver enhancements to our current and future products and services that customer s desire 
from time to time  we experience delays in the planned release dates of enhancements to our products and services  and we have discovered errors in new releases after their introduction 
new product versions or upgrades may not be released according to schedule  or may contain errors when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products and services  or customer claims  including warranty claims  against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not deliver new product versions  upgrades  or other enhancements to existing products and services on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
we are also continually seeking to develop new offerings 
however  we remain subject to all of the risks inherent in product development  including unanticipated technical or other development problems  which could result in material delays in product introduction and acceptance or significantly increased costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new services or products  or to introduce in a timely manner and gain acceptance of such new products or services in the marketplace 
our products and services might not keep pace with technological change 
we must continually modify and enhance our services and products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms  database technology  electronic commerce technical standards  and other items 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements or introductions  or modifications by vendors of operating systems  back office applications  and browsers and other internet related applications  could harm our business 
we rely on third party software and services that may be difficult to replace 
we license or purchase software and services provided by third parties in order to offer some of our services and software offerings 
such third party software and services may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the loss or inability to maintain our rights to use any of these software or services could result in delays in the sale of our services or software offerings until equivalent technology is either developed by us  or  if available  is identified  licensed  and integrated  which could harm our business 
our stock price has experienced high volatility in the past  may continue to be volatile  and may decline 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may do so in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  such as variations in our actual and anticipated operating results  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts  failure to achieve earnings expectations  the volatility inherent in stock prices within the emerging sector within which we conduct business  and the volume of trading in our common stock  including sales of substantial amounts of common stock issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in addition  the stock market  particularly the nasdaq stock market  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many technology and computer software companies  particularly internet related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents further  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
in july  we and several of our current and former officers were named as defendants in two securities class action lawsuits based on alleged errors and omissions concerning underwriting terms in the prospectus for our initial public offering 
in april  these lawsuits were consolidated 
this consolidated lawsuit is one of more than similar pending cases filed against companies that completed initial public offerings between and and the underwriters that took them public 
in july  we decided to participate in a proposed settlement being negotiated by representatives of a coalition of issuers named as defendants in similar actions and their insurers 
although we believe that the plaintiffs claims have no merit  we have decided to participate in the proposed settlement to avoid the cost and distraction of continued litigation 
the proposed settlement agreement would dispose of all remaining claims against us and the individual defendants  without any admission of wrongdoing by us or the individual defendants 
the proposed settlement is subject to final approval by the parties and the court 
there is no guarantee that the parties or the court will approve the proposed settlement 
should the parties and the court fail to approve the proposed settlement  we would continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
any liability we incur in connection with this lawsuit could materially harm our business and financial position and  even if we defend ourselves successfully  there is a risk that management s distraction in dealing with this lawsuit could harm our results 
in order to meet our business objectives we need to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we depend significantly on direct sales  which are subject to personnel risks and may cause us to miss some opportunities 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating  and retaining key personnel 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than us for attracting experienced personnel 
we also compete for personnel with other software vendors and consulting and professional services companies 
further  recent changes in applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees in the future 
we rely on our direct sales force to sell our services and software in the marketplace 
we anticipate increasing our direct sales force by approximately in fiscal  compared to the level at september  there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need 
if we were unable to hire or retain competent sales personnel our business would suffer 
in addition  by relying primarily on a direct sales model  we may miss sales opportunities that might be available through other sales channels  such as domestic and international resellers and strategic referral arrangements 
any inability to hire and retain salespeople or any other qualified personnel  or any loss of the services of key personnel  would harm our business 
we may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
in the future  we may be required to seek additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
factors such as the commercial success of our existing services and products  the timing and success of any new services and products  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations and cash flows  the use of cash in our stock repurchase program  the status of competitive services and products  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell businesses or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities  the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  such securities could have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential growth  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 

table of contents our ability to protect our intellectual property is limited and our products may be subject to infringement claims by third parties 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology  processes  trade secrets  and other proprietary information  and our ability to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure and use 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information 
we do not own any issued patents or have any patent applications pending 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently 
we provide our licensed customers with access to object code versions of our software  and to other proprietary information underlying our software 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly because the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted 
while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate  or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products or other intellectual property rights 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  over the past several years  we have made numerous changes in our product names 
although we own registered trademarks in the united states and have filed trademark applications in the united states and in certain other countries  we do not have assurance that our strategy with respect to our trademark portfolio will be adequate to secure or protect all necessary intellectual property 
if we acquire companies  products  or technologies  we may face risks associated with those acquisitions 
in the future  we may acquire companies or make investments in other companies  products  or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our prior or future acquisitions or investments to the extent that we anticipate  or at all 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if any acquisition or investment is not perceived as improving our earnings per share  our stock price may decline 
in addition  we may incur non cash amortization charges from acquisitions  which could harm our operating results 
any completed acquisitions would also require significant integration efforts  diverting our attention from our business operations and strategy 
anti takeover effects of our rights agreement  charter documents  and delaware law could discourage or prevent a change in control of concur 
we have a shareholder rights agreement in place  under which our stockholders have special rights  in the form of additional voting and beneficial ownership  in the event that a person or group not approved by the board of directors were to acquire  or to announce the intention to acquire or more of our outstanding shares 
this plan is designed to have the effect of discouraging  delaying or rendering more difficult an acquisition of us that has not been approved by our board of directors 
in addition  there are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions in the delaware general corporation law  that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control 
for example our board of directors may  without stockholder approval  issue shares of preferred stock with special voting or economic rights  our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights  and  therefore  each of our directors can only be elected by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock  
table of contents a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by a majority of our board of directors  the chairman of our board of directors  or our chief executive officer  our stockholders may not take action by written consent  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected each year  and we require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate and foreign currency risks 
interest rate risk 
we have debt instruments with variable rates of interest 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
some of the potential differences in future cash flows likely would be mitigated because all of our debt outstanding at september  matures in less than one year 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows related to these debt instruments 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk 
derivatives 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
