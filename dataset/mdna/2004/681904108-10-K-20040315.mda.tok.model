overview of for omnicare  the year was one of strong growth and development  owing largely to the success of its acquisition and integration model 
during the year  the company made two strategically important acquisitions that  together  increased the size of its institutional pharmacy business by 
the company undertook and essentially completed the integration of these acquisitions and began reaping the benefits of its acquisition plan  successfully completed a major refinancing  and continued to generate solid growth and enhancements in the cost structure of its core pharmacy business 
on january   the company completed the acquisition of ncs healthcare  inc ncs  which represented the largest acquisition made in the company s year history of making institutional pharmacy acquisitions 
this acquisition significantly expanded the company s presence in the long term care pharmacy market  increasing the number of beds served by omnicare by approximately to approximately  and annualized revenues by approximately to approximately billion at the time of the acquisition 
in addition to its large institutional pharmacy operation  ncs also added other businesses  including a hospital pharmacy management business  an information technology business providing pharmacy operating software and certain specialty pharmacy businesses 
on july   omnicare completed the acquisition of sunscript pharmacy corporation sunscript  which increased the number of beds served by omnicare by approximately to approximately  and annualized revenues by approximately to approximately billion at the time of the acquisition 
the company s integration plan for these acquisitions included the realization of economies of scale and cost synergies in purchasing of pharmaceuticals  and in consolidation of overlapping geographic locations and redundant functions 
to date  the company has consolidated pharmacies serving approximately  beds  or the majority of the ncs and sunscript pharmacies that are to be consolidated  as well as certain omnicare pharmacies closed as part of the overall consolidation plan 
in addition  the other acquired pharmacies have been migrated to the company s systems and programs in order to achieve the targeted savings in the purchasing of pharmaceuticals and other economies of scale 
like others in the contract research cro industry  the performance of the company s cro business reflects the somewhat volatile nature of this business given the numerous variables outside the company s control 
the softness in revenues in was attributable to several client driven cancellations or delays in the commencement or continuation of certain projects 
given that these delays were client driven decisions  and as such unpredictable  the company was unable to immediately adjust costs accordingly  which impacted margins for the year 
certain of these projects are expected to be under way in  and positive trends in new business have begun to emerge in the first quarter of given this  along with recent cost reduction efforts  the company anticipates improved performance in its cro business in omnicare continued to generate strong operating cash flow in  primarily as a result of its earnings growth 
moreover  to finance the ncs transaction on a long term basis and to enhance its financial strength  the company undertook a major refinancing in june the company s balance sheet reflects the favorable capital structure that the company put in place in connection with this refinancing 
as part of its capital restructuring  the company raised million in a term a loan  and completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes  million of contingent convertible notes and  shares of its common stock 
in connection with the refinancings  the company entered into a new  four year million credit facility  consisting of the aforementioned million term loan commitment and a million revolving credit commitment 
omnicare used the net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes and the term a loan to repay the existing credit facility 
a portion of the contingent convertible notes and a portion of the net proceeds from the common stock offering were used to purchase and retire the company s outstanding million of convertible subordinated debentures 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
omnicare s total debt to total capitalization was approximately at december   down approximately basis points from the end of the first quarter of  which was the last quarter prior to the june refinancing 
the company believes that the refinancing has enhanced its financial position and provided the financial flexibility to support its ongoing growth strategies 
looking ahead  the company continues to monitor key issues related to healthcare funding  including the increasing pressures on state medicaid budgets arising from the economic downturn coupled with growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the aging of the population  the introduction of new  more efficacious  albeit more expensive  medications  offset somewhat by increasing use of generic medications  and the impact of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicaid and medicare programs  including the mma  signed into law by president bush on december  the mma includes a new medicare outpatient drug benefit effective january  under the mma  medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities  which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs subject to various co pays  deductibles and coverage limitations 
additionally  medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to full benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles  will receive drug coverage under the new federal benefit rather than the state medicaid program  including nursing home residents served by the company whose drug costs are currently covered by medicaid 
regulations governing implementation of this benefit are now being promulgated 
moreover  the secretary of the department of health and human services is required to conduct a study on the impact of the medicare drug benefit structure on nursing home residents 
the purpose of the study is to ensure that the patient safety and quality of care standards that are currently part of regulation and pharmacy practice as well as appropriate reimbursements are maintained 
accordingly  it is difficult to predict the impact or outcome of this legislation 
nonetheless  pharmaceuticals remain the most cost effective means of treating the chronic illnesses of the frailest members of society  and the geriatric pharmaceutical business offers meaningful solutions to containing healthcare costs while ensuring the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
the company s strategy for future growth remains aligned with such economic interests and demographic trends in healthcare 
by expanding the company s core pharmaceutical distribution business and then leveraging that business through the development and expansion of clinical and information services  the company intends to continue its value creation strategy

the company believes that certain investors find ebitda to be a useful tool for measuring a company s ability to service its debt  however  ebitda does not represent net cash flows from operating activities  as defined by us gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity or net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance

at december   omnicare served long term care facilities comprising approximately  beds as compared with approximately  beds served at december  the increase in revenues and in beds served was primarily a result of the acquisitions of ncs in january and sunscript in july  as discussed below 
the results of the ncs and sunscript acquisitions were included only from their date of acquisition  or january  and july   respectively

 the company included million and million of reimbursable out of pockets in its cro services segment reported revenue and direct cost amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  were lower than in largely due to the impact of client driven cancellations or delays in the commencement or continuation of certain projects 
operating income in the cro services segment was million in compared with million in as a percentage of the segment s revenue  operating income was in compared with in the improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to the year over year impact of restructuring charges associated with the phase ii productivity and consolidation program  which resulted in million of pretax expense in and no expense in as the phase ii program was finalized in 
this improvement was partially offset by the unfavorable impact on operating income of the lower revenues discussed above 
backlog at december  of million was relatively consistent with the december  backlog of million 
consolidated the company s consolidated gross profit of million increased million in from the prior year amount of million 
gross profit as a percentage of total net sales of in the year ended december   was slightly lower than the experienced during positively impacting overall gross profit margin were the company s purchasing leverage associated with the procurement of pharmaceuticals due  in part  to the completion of the integration of the aps business and benefits realized from the company s formulary compliance program  as well as the increased use of generic drugs  and leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs at the company s pharmacies as a result of the reduced cost structure brought about by the phase ii program 
these favorable factors were offset primarily by the initial impact of the lower margin ncs and sunscript business in the first and third quarters  respectively which impact diminished as the company achieved economies of scale  drug purchasing improvements  and consolidated redundant pharmacy locations  and  to a lesser extent  by the previously mentioned shift in mix toward newer  branded drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly that typically produce higher gross profit but lower gross profit margins  and pricing pressures  incuding lower government reimbursement formulas and other cost control measures in some states 
sales mix for the company also impacts gross profit and includes primarily sales of pharmaceuticals and  to a lesser extent  contract research services  infusion therapy products and services  medical supplies  and other miscellaneous products and services 
sales of pharmaceuticals account for the majority of the company s sales and gross profit 
contract research services and infusion therapy gross profit margins are typically higher than gross profit margins associated with sales of pharmaceuticals 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no increase in fixed costs eg  rent and minimal increases in variable costs eg  utilities  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
omnicare s selling  general and administrative operating expenses for the year ended december  of million were higher than the amount of million by million  due to the overall growth of the business  including the acquisitions of ncs and sunscript in the first and third quarters of  respectively

the trust piers offer fixed cash distributions at a rate of per annum payable quarterly  and a fixed conversion price of under a contingent conversion feature whereby the holders may convert their trust piers if the closing sales price of omnicare common stock for a predetermined period  beginning with the quarter ending september   is more than of the then applicable conversion price or  during a predetermined period  if the daily average of the trading prices for the trust piers is less than of the average of the conversion values for the trust piers through for any period thereafter through maturity 
the trust piers also will pay contingent distributions  commencing with the quarterly distribution period beginning june   if the average trading prices of the trust piers for a predetermined period equals or more of the stated liquidation amount of the trust piers 
embedded in the trust piers are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at december   the values of both derivatives were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future results of operations 
omnicare irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees  on a subordinated basis  certain payments to be made by the trust in connection with the trust piers 
the credit facility  the senior notes  the senior notes and the contingent convertible notes contain representations and warranties  covenants and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility are based on prevailing market rates as discussed in the following section 
the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and other short and long term debt financings  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
while no such plans currently exist  the company may  in the future  refinance its indebtedness  issue additional indebtedness  or issue additional equity as deemed appropriate 
the company believes that  if needed  these additional external sources of financing are readily available

the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  so changes in fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement is recorded as a noncurrent liability and reduced the carrying value of the related senior notes by million as of december  at december   the fair value of omnicare s credit facility approximates its carrying value  and the fair value of the senior notes  senior notes and convertible debentures is approximately million  million and million  respectively 
embedded in the trust piers are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at december   the values of both derivatives were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future results of operations 
the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to bad debts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  insurance accruals  pension obligations  restructuring accruals  income taxes and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition pharmacy services revenue is recognized when products or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursable from state medicaid and  to a lesser extent  the federal medicare programs 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
contractual allowances are adjusted to actual as cash is received and claims are settled 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contract research services a portion of the company s revenues are earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service  unless the units of service are performed over an extended period of time 
for extended units of service  revenue is recognized based on labor hours expended as a percentage of total labor hours expected to be expended 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for extended units of service 
the company s contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical credit losses and specifically identified credit risks 
management reviews this allowance on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include current and expected economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances and the creditworthiness of a customer 
given the company s experience  management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its obligations  the company could be exposed to losses in excess of the provisions established 
if economic conditions worsen  or the company s customers reimbursement rates were to be adversely affected  impacting the company s customers ability to pay  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are no significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory write offs 
omnicare uses a periodic inventory system 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
the company evaluates various criteria in developing estimated cost of goods sold during non inventory months  including the historical cost of goods sold trends based on prior physical inventory results  a review of cost of goods sold information reflecting current customer contract terms  and consideration and analysis of changes in customer base  product mix  payor mix  state medicaid and third party insurance reimbursement levels or other issues that may impact cost of goods sold 
actual cost of goods sold has not varied significantly from estimated amounts in non inventory months 
goodwill sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually 
sfas requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
events may occur in the future that could result in an impairment of the company s goodwill  and any resulting impairment charge could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the assessment of goodwill impairment requires estimates of future cash flows 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
changes in these estimates of future cash flows due to unforeseen events could affect the outcome of the company s goodwill impairment analysis 
insurance accruals the company is self insured for certain health  property and casualty insurance claims 
the company closely monitors and continually evaluates its historical claims experience and obtains input from third party insurance professionals to estimate the appropriate level of accrual for incurred claims 
although significant fluctuations may occur in the short term due to unforeseen events and claims  the company s experience  coupled with its stop loss coverage  has indicated that its methodology provides for reasonable insurance expense estimates over a long term period 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company utilizes estimates in developing its actuarial assumptions including such items as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rate and rate of compensation increase  among other items  and relies on actuarial computations to estimate the future potential liability  expense and funding requirements associated with these benefits 
these actuarial assumptions and estimates  if assessed differently  could have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a change in the discount rate used to calculate the company s pension obligations would not have a material impact on the company s operating results 
restructuring programs the company has recorded accruals in connection with its restructuring programs  primarily for facility exit costs including lease obligations and involuntary termination benefits 
the accruals were established based on management s best estimate of the costs to be incurred and the timing of payments 
changes in these estimates or actual results could require the company to make adjustments to the recorded accruals 
management reviews these accruals on a regular basis for appropriateness 
income taxes the company estimates its tax liabilities based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could experience potential losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential gains 
a change in the company s overall effective tax rate would impact income tax and net income by million or per diluted share 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas 
this statement includes new disclosure requirements related to a company s pensions 
the annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the new interim disclosure provisions are effective for the first interim period beginning after december  the required disclosure provisions of sfas have been incorporated into the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
the statement clarifies some of the provisions of the initial fasb interpretation no 
fin  issued in january fin r is effective for the company for financial statements initially issued after december  the adoption of fin did not have  and fin r is not expected to have  a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the guidance of eitf was effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
outlook the company derives approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources  principally state medicaid and to a lesser extent federal medicare programs  and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers and snfs 
as part of ongoing operations  the company and its customers are subject to regulatory changes in the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
since  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system 
the balanced budget act of the bba sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  changing the reimbursement policies applicable to various healthcare providers 
in a significant change for the snf industry  the bba provided for the introduction in of the prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible residents of snfs 
prior to pps  snfs under medicare received cost based reimbursement 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services furnished during a medicare covered stay  including pharmacy services 
pps resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
admissions of medicare residents  particularly those requiring complex care  declined in many snfs due to concerns relating to the adequacy of reimbursement under pps 
this caused a weakness in medicare census leading to a significant reduction of overall occupancy in the snfs the company serves 
this decline in occupancy and acuity levels adversely impacted omnicare s results beginning in  as the company experienced lower utilization of omnicare services  coupled with pps related pricing pressure from omnicare s snf customers 
in and  congress sought to restore some of the reductions in reimbursement resulting from pps 
a bbra provision subsequently modified by bipa gave snfs a temporary rate increase for certain specific high acuity patients beginning april   and ending when the centers for medicare medicaid services cms implements a refined patient classification system under pps 
cms did not implement such refinements in fiscal year  and the bush administration has indicated that the refinements also will not be implemented in fiscal year  thus continuing the additional rate increases currently in place for certain high acuity patients 
bbra also included an overall across the board increase in payments otherwise determined under the bba for all patients for federal fiscal years and in  bipa further increased reimbursement by means of a temporary across the board increase in the nursing component of the federal rate for all patients for services furnished before october   and for fiscal year  a rate increase for all patients 
these provisions of the bbra and bipa helped to improve the financial condition of snfs  motivated them to increase admissions  particularly of higher acuity residents  and stabilized the unfavorable operating trends attributable to pps 
while certain of the increases in medicare reimbursement for snfs provided for under the bbra and the bipa expired on october   the impact of these expirations on the company s customers has not had a significant impact on omnicare to date 
nonetheless  the loss of revenues associated with future changes in snf payments could  in the future  have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients which could  in turn  adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
partially offsetting the october  expiration of certain payment increases under bbra and bipa discussed above  cms published  on august   a final rule announcing a market basket increase in snf pps rates for fiscal year  which began october  in addition  the rule increased fiscal year rates by an additional to reflect cumulative forecast errors since the start of the snf pps on july  together  cms estimates that these adjustments will result in an estimated million increase in medicare payments to snfs in fiscal year moreover  the final rule does not adopt refinements to the current patient classification system for fiscal year  which results in the continuation of the temporary add on payment for certain high acuity patients established by the bbra 
cms estimates that these temporary payments will equal approximately billion in fiscal year president bush s proposed fiscal year budget indicates that the refinements will not be adopted in fiscal year in december  congress enacted the mma  which includes a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under a new medicare part d 
until the part d benefit goes into effect on january   medicare beneficiaries can receive assistance with their outpatient prescription drug costs beginning in june through a new prescription drug discount card program  which will give enrollees access to negotiated discounted prices for prescription drugs 
under the mma  medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities  which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs 
medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles will have their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit  including nursing home residents served by the company whose drug costs are currently covered by state medicaid programs 
implementation of the new medicare drug benefit will require implementing regulations by cms 
in addition  the secretary of the department of health and human services is required to conduct a study of current standards of practice for pharmacy services provided to patients in long term care settings  and  among other things  make recommendations regarding necessary actions and appropriate reimbursement to ensure the provision of prescription drugs to medicare beneficiaries in nursing facilities consistent with existing patient safety and quality of care standards 
the mma also reforms the medicare part b prescription drug payment methodology 
the company s revenues for drugs dispensed under medicare part b are not significant in comparison to total revenues 
the mma also includes provisions that will institute administrative reforms designed to improve medicare program operations 
it is uncertain at this time the impact that the mma s legislative reforms ultimately will have on the company 
other healthcare funding issues remain  including pressures on federal and state medicaid budgets due to the economic downturn  which has led to decreasing reimbursement rates in certain states 
on may   president bush signed into law the jobs and growth reconciliation tax act  which includes billion in temporary aid to the states  billion of which is earmarked for state medicaid programs 
this additional funding expires june  in addition  some states continue to experience budget shortfalls  which may prompt them to consider implementing reductions in medicaid reimbursement and other cost control measures 
while the company has managed to adjust to these pricing pressures to date  such pressures are likely to continue or escalate if economic recovery does not fully emerge  and there can be no assurance that such occurrence will not have an adverse impact on the company s business 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  and the long term financing of the medicare and medicaid programs 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
further  the pace and quality of new drug development is yielding many promising new drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly 
these new drugs may be more expensive than older  less effective drug therapies due to rising research costs 
however  they are significantly more effective in curing or ameliorating illness and in lowering overall healthcare costs by reducing  among other things  hospitalizations  physician visits  nursing time and lab tests 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company anticipates that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it is not possible to predict the effect of any further initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
further  while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgetary constraints of its clients  or consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  new drug discovery remains an important priority of pharmaceutical manufacturers 
pharmaceutical manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in accelerating drug research development and commercialization
