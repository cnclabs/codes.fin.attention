we maintain a diversified portfolio of long term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located in the united states 
in making investments  we generally have focused on established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management 
we have sought to diversify our investments in terms of geographic locations  operators and facility types 
in evaluating potential investments  we consider such factors as o the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility  o the facility s historical  current and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs  capital expenditures and lease or debt service obligations  providing a competitive return on investment to us  o the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  o the geographic area and type of facility  o the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the jurisdiction in which the facility is located  o the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and o the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients 
one of our fundamental investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and fixed rate mortgage loans  and to obtain substantial liquidity deposits 
additional security is typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
we prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  we sometimes pursue alternative investment structures  including convertible participating and participating mortgages  that achieve returns comparable to equity investments 
the following summarizes the primary investment structures we typically use 
average annualized yields reflect existing contractual arrangements 
however  in view of the ongoing financial challenges in the long term care industry  we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
therefore  the annualized yields as of january  set forth below are not necessarily indicative of or a forecast of actual yields  which may be lower 
purchase leaseback 
in a purchase leaseback transaction  we purchase the property from the operator and lease it back to the operator over terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
the leases originated by us generally provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in the consumer price index cpi or increases in the revenue streams generated by the underlying properties  with certain fixed minimum and maximum levels 
the average annualized yield from leases was at january  convertible participating mortgage 
convertible participating mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in the revenues generated by the underlying long term care facilities  with certain maximum limits 
convertible participating mortgages afford us the option to convert our mortgage into direct ownership of the property  generally at a point six to nine years from inception 
if we exercise our purchase option  we are obligated to lease the property back to the operator for the balance of the originally agreed term and for the originally agreed participations in revenues or cpi adjustments 
this allows us to capture a portion of the potential appreciation in value of the real estate 
the operator has the right to buy out our option at prices based on specified formulas 
at december   we did not have any convertible participating mortgages 
participating mortgage 
participating mortgages are similar to convertible participating mortgages except that we do not have a purchase option 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying long term care facilities  with certain maximum limits 
at december   we did not have any participating mortgages 
fixed rate mortgage 
these mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
the average annualized yield on these investments was at january  the following table identifies the years of expiration of the payment obligations due to us under existing contractual obligations

we may incur additional indebtedness and have historically sought to maintain a long term debt to total capitalization ratio in the range of to 
total capitalization is total stockholders equity plus long term debt 
we intend to periodically review our policy with respect to our debt to total capitalization ratio and to modify the policy as our management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions 
our strategy generally has been to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets  and to employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
we may use proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities 
we may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness  and may obtain indebtedness which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock 
where debt financing is available on terms deemed favorable  we generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
if we need capital to repay indebtedness as it matures  we may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on these investments 
this could also result in adverse tax consequences to us 
we may be required to issue additional equity interests in our company  which could dilute your investment in our company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
federal income tax considerations 
we intend to make and manage our investments  including the sale or disposition of property or other investments  and to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  unless  because of changes in circumstances or changes in the internal revenue code  our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we generally will not pay federal income taxes on the portion of our taxable income which is distributed to stockholders 
policies with respect to certain activities 
if our board of directors determines that additional funding is required  we may raise such funds through additional equity offerings  debt financing  retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code concerning taxability of undistributed reit taxable income or a combination of these methods 
borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured or unsecured  and publicly or privately placed debt instruments  purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets  long term  tax exempt bonds or financing from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  or securitizations  any of which indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets 
such indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our assets or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates 
we have authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for reit qualification  we may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 
we may engage in the purchase and sale of investments 
we do not underwrite the securities of other issuers 
our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
in the opinion of our management  our properties are adequately covered by insurance

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
these risks are not the only ones that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to the operators of our facilities our financial position could be weakened and our ability to pay dividends could be limited if any of our major operators were unable to meet their obligations to us or failed to renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire  or if we were unable to lease or re lease our facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms 
these adverse developments could arise due to a number of factors  including those listed below 
our recent efforts to restructure and stabilize our portfolio may not prove to be successful 
in large part as a result of the changes in medicare reimbursement of services provided by skilled nursing facilities and reimbursement cuts imposed under state medicaid programs  a number of operators of our properties have encountered significant financial difficulties during the last several years 
in  our investment portfolio consisted of properties and our largest public operators by investment were sun healthcare group  inc sun  integrated health services  advocat  inc advocat and mariner health care inc mariner 
some of these operators  including sun  integrated health services and mariner  subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection 
other of our operators were required to undertake significant restructuring efforts 
we have restructured our arrangements with many of our operators whereby we have renegotiated lease and mortgage terms  re leased properties to new operators and have closed and or disposed of properties 
at december   our investment portfolio consisted of properties and our largest public operators by investment were sun  advocat and mariner 
our largest private company operators by investment were seacrest healthcare and claremont healthcare holdings  inc claremont 
we have a non binding agreement in principle with sun  our largest operator by investment regarding our properties that were leased to various affiliates of sun 
finalization of our agreement with sun is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation 
in addition  we continue to have ongoing restructuring discussions with claremont regarding five facilities claremont currently leases from us 
we might not be successful in reaching definitive agreements with sun or claremont 
we are also aware of four properties in our portfolio located in illinois where facility operations are currently insufficient to meet rental payments due to us under our leases for these facilities 
these lease payments are currently being paid by the lessee from funds other than those generated by the facilities 
it is possible that we will need to take steps to restructure this portion of our portfolio  or other properties in our portfolio with respect to which our operators encounter financial difficulty 
we cannot assure you that our recent efforts to restructure and stabilize our property portfolio will be successful 
the bankruptcy  insolvency or financial deterioration of our operators could delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators for rejected facilities 
we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations  which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency 
although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment  evict an operator  demand immediate repayment and other remedies  the bankruptcy laws afford certain protections to a party that has filed for bankruptcy that may render these remedies unenforceable 
in addition  an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rent or mortgage payments during the bankruptcy case 
if one of our lessees seeks bankruptcy protection  title of the united states code bankruptcy code  provides that a trustee in a liquidation or reorganization case under the bankruptcy code  or a debtor in possession in a reorganization case under the bankruptcy code  has the option to assume or reject the unexpired lease obligations of a debtor lessee 
however  our lease arrangements with operators who operate more than one of our facilities are generally made pursuant to a single master lease covering all of that operator s facilities leased from us 
subject to certain restrictions  a debtor lessee under a master lease agreement would generally be required to assume or reject a master lease as a whole  rather than making the decision on a facility by facility basis  thereby preventing the debtor lessee from assuming only the better performing facilities and terminating the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing facilities 
whether or not a court would require a master lease agreement to be assumed or rejected as a whole would depend on a number of factors  including applicable state law  the parties intent  whether the master lease agreement and related documents were executed contemporaneously  the nature and purpose of the relevant documents  whether there was separate and distinct consideration for each lease  and the provisions contained in the relevant documents  including whether the relevant documents are interrelated and contain ample cross references 
therefore  it is not possible to predict how a bankruptcy court would decide this issue 
o assumption of leases 
in the event that an unexpired lease is assumed by or on behalf of the debtor lessee  any defaults  other than those created by the financial condition of the debtor lessee  the commencement of its bankruptcy case or the appointment of a trustee  would have to be cured and all the rental obligations thereunder generally would be entitled to a priority over other unsecured claims 
generally  unexpired leases must be assumed in their totality  however  a bankruptcy court has the power to refuse to enforce certain provisions of a lease  such as cross default provisions or penalty provisions  that would otherwise prevent or limit the ability of a debtor lessee from assuming or assuming and assigning to another party the unexpired lease 
o rejection of leases 
generally  the debtor lessee is required to make rent payments to us during its bankruptcy unless and until it rejects the lease 
the rejection of a lease is deemed to be a pre petition breach of the lease and the lessor will be allowed a pre petition general unsecured claim that will be limited to any unpaid rent already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease  without acceleration  for the greater of a one year and b fifteen percent  not to exceed three years  of the remaining term of such lease  following the earlier of i the petition date and ii repossession or surrender of the leased property 
although the amount of a lease rejection claim is subject to the statutory cap described above  the lessor should receive the same percentage recovery on account of its claim as other holders of allowed pre petition unsecured claims receive from the bankruptcy estate 
if the debtor lessee rejects the lease  the facility would be returned to us 
in that event  if we were unable to re lease the facility to a new operator on favorable terms or only after a significant delay  we could lose some or all of the associated revenue from that facility for an extended period of time 
if an operator defaults under one of our mortgage loans  we may have to foreclose on the mortgage or protect our interest by acquiring title to the property and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the facility s investment potential 
operators may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies  seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations 
if an operator seeks bankruptcy protection  the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy law would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the operator unless relief is obtained from the court 
high loan to value ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loan upon foreclosure 
the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval and licensure process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the replacement of the previous operator licensed to manage the facility 
in some instances  we may take possession of a property and such action could expose us to successor liabilities 
these events  if they were to occur  could reduce our revenue and operating cash flow 
operators that fail to comply with governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid  licensing and certification requirements  fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may be unable to meet their obligations to us 
our operators are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted 
these changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators costs of doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third party payors 
the failure of any of our operators to comply with these laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in particular o medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of our skilled nursing facility operators revenue is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  and failure to maintain certification and accreditation in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs 
loss of certification or accreditation could cause the revenues of our operators to decline  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in that event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced  which could in turn cause the value of our affected properties to decline 
state licensing and medicare and medicaid laws also require operators of nursing homes and assisted living facilities to comply with extensive standards governing operations 
federal and state agencies administering those laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints 
our operators and their managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time  and such sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them 
if they are unable to cure deficiencies which have been identified or which are identified in the future  such sanctions may be imposed and if imposed may adversely affect our operators revenues  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
o licensing and certification 
our operators and facilities are subject to regulatory and licensing requirements of federal  state and local authorities and are periodically audited by them to confirm compliance 
failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure would prevent a facility from operating or result in a suspension of reimbursement payments until all licensure issues have been resolved and the necessary licenses obtained or reinstated 
our skilled nursing facilities require governmental approval  in the form of a certificate of need that generally varies by state and is subject to change  prior to the addition or construction of new beds  the addition of services or certain capital expenditures 
some of our facilities may be unable to satisfy current and future certificate of need requirements and may for this reason be unable to continue operating in the future 
in such event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time 
o fraud and abuse regulations 
there are various extremely complex and largely uninterpreted federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers  including criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the balanced budget act of expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs 
furthermore  the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services  or oig  in cooperation with other federal and state agencies  continues to focus on the activities of skilled nursing facilities in certain states in which we have properties 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
the violation of any of these regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 
o legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  p 
law  which is one example of such legislation  was enacted in late the medicare reimbursement changes for the long term care industry under this act are limited to a temporary increase in the per diem amount paid to skilled nursing facilities for residents who have aids 
the significant expansion of other benefits for medicare beneficiaries under this act  such as the expanded prescription drug benefit  could result in financial pressures on the medicare program that might result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts for our operators 
other proposals under consideration include efforts by individual states to control costs by decreasing state medicaid reimbursements  a federal patient protection act to protect consumers in managed care plans  efforts to improve quality of care and reduce medical errors throughout the health care industry and hospital cost containment initiatives by public and private payors 
we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  what effect  if any  these proposals would have on operators and  thus  our business 
regulatory proposals and rules are released on an ongoing basis that may have major impact on the healthcare system generally and the skilled nursing and long term care industries in particular 
our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced 
changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our operators has in the past  and could in the future  result in a substantial reduction in our operators revenues and operating margins 
additionally  net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post payment audits 
payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary 
there also continue to be new legislative and regulatory proposals that could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers 
in some cases  states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our operators  which are currently being reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or private third party payors 
further limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and results of operations which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and potentially jeopardize their ability to meet their obligations to us 
our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may affect their ability to pay their lease and mortgage payments to us 
as is typical in the healthcare industry  our operators are often subject to claims that their services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects 
many of these operators have experienced an increasing trend in the frequency and severity of professional liability and general liability insurance claims and litigation asserted against them 
the insurance coverage maintained by our operators may not cover all claims made against them nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost  if at all 
in some states  insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and or litigation may not  in certain cases  be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability 
as a result  our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits 
we also believe that there has been  and will continue to be  an increase in governmental investigations of long term care providers  particularly in the area of medicare medicaid false claims  as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations 
insurance is not available to cover such losses 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation  whether currently asserted or arising in the future  could have a material adverse effect on an operator s financial condition 
if an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage  if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage  if an operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages  or if an operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action  the operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities 
one of our largest operators was recently served with six lawsuits by the state of arkansas seeking substantial damages relating to patient care issues and alleged medicaid false claims 
on february   advocat announced that it had been served with six lawsuits by the state of arkansas alleging violations by advocat and certain of its subsidiaries of the arkansas abuse of adults act and the arkansas medicaid false claims act 
in its announcement  advocat stated that the complaints seek  in the aggregate  actual damages of approximately  and fines and penalties in excess of million 
although advocat stated its intention to vigorously defend itself against the subject allegations  advocat further stated that it cannot predict the outcome of the subject lawsuits or the impact of the ultimate outcome on advocat s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
advocat accounts for approximately of our total revenues 
in the event that there is an adverse outcome to advocat in these lawsuits  or in the event that advocat s business is otherwise adversely affected as a result of the lawsuits for example  as a result of penalties imposed in connection with a settlement of the lawsuits  as a result of licensure revocation  admission holds or similar restrictions being imposed or as a result of a decline in business due to reputational issues  and advocat is unable to pay its full monthly rental obligation to us  then we will experience a reduction of our rental income 
should such events occur  our income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
we are unable currently to predict how this matter may ultimately affect us 
increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower revenues for some of our operators and may affect the ability of our tenants to meet their payment obligations to us 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
our operators are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
we cannot be certain the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us 
our operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses and therefore affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
the market for qualified nurses  healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
this situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements 
risks related to us and our operations in addition to the operator related risks discussed above  there are a number of risks directly associated with us and our operations 
we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs  and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital  we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing commitments 
in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  or the code  we are required  among other things  to distribute each year to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income 
because of this distribution requirement  we may not be able to fund  from cash retained from operations  all future capital needs  including capital needs to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing commitments 
as a result  we may rely on external sources of capital 
if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources  we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business  or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature  which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even  in extreme circumstances  affect our ability to continue operations 
our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including general market conditions and the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 
generally speaking  difficult capital market conditions in our industry during the past several years and our need to stabilize our portfolio have limited our access to capital 
our potential capital sources include  but are not limited to equity financing 
as with other publicly traded companies  the availability of equity capital will depend  in part  on the market price of our common stock which  in turn  will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time including o the extent of investor interest  o the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  o our financial performance and that of our operators  o the contents of analyst reports about us and the reit industry  o general stock and bond market conditions  including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities  which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions  o our failure to maintain or increase our dividend  which is dependent  to a large part  on growth of funds from operations which in turn depends upon increased revenues from additional investments and rental increases  and o other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in reit tax laws 
the market value of the equity securities of a reit is generally based upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and reduce the value of your investment 
debt financing leverage 
financing for future investments and our maturing commitments may be provided by borrowings under our bank line of credit  private or public offerings of debt  the assumption of secured indebtedness  mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risks that our cash flow will be insufficient to make timely payments of interest  that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions  our cash flow may not be sufficient in all years to pay distributions to our stockholders and to repay all maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates  changes in our debt ratings or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase  which could reduce our profitability and the amount of dividends we are able to pay 
moreover  additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage 
our degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders  including affecting our investment grade ratings  affecting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 
certain of our operators account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
based on existing contractual rent and lease payments regarding the restructuring of certain existing investments  advocat and sun each account for over of our current contractual monthly revenues  with sun accounting for slightly over of our current contractual monthly revenues 
additionally  our top five operators account for over of our current contractual monthly revenues 
the failure or inability of any of these operators to pay their obligations to us could materially reduce our revenues and net income  which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay and cause our stock price to decline 
for information regarding our non binding agreement in principle with sun  see portfolio developments  sun healthcare group  inc unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful 
for example  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties  including contingent liabilities  or newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
if we agree to provide funding to enable healthcare operators to build  expand or renovate facilities on our properties and the project is not completed  we could be forced to become involved in the development to ensure completion or we could lose the property 
these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 
our assets may be subject to impairment charges 
we periodically but not less than annually evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
we may not be able to sell certain closed facilities for their book value 
from time to time  we close facilities and actively market such facilities for sale 
to the extent we are unable to sell these properties for our book value  we may be required to take an impairment charge or loss on the sale  either of which would reduce our net income 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness and we may increase our indebtedness in the future 
as of december   our debt was million  the majority of which currently comes due in our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could o limit our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to holders of our capital stock  o potentially cause us to violate a cross default provision under our various long term debt obligations  o make us more vulnerable to economic downturns  o potentially limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures if  as a result of a decline in our rating agency ratings  our cost of capital increases as compared to our competitors cost of capital thus reducing the spread on our investments  and o impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
all of our properties are special purpose properties that could not be readily converted to general residential  retail or office use 
healthcare facilities that participate in medicare or medicaid must meet extensive program requirements  including physical plant and operational requirements  which are revised from time to time 
such requirements may include a duty to admit medicare and medicaid patients  limiting the ability of the facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits 
medicare and medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance  and may be excluded from the programs in some cases without a prior hearing for failure to meet program requirements 
transfers of operations of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of our properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that our lessee or mortgagor becomes unable to meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan  the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator with a new operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should such events occur  our income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
as an owner or lender with respect to real property  we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner of real property or a secured lender  such as us  may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  under or disposed of in connection with such property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence or disposal of such substances and liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property 
the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and the owner s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property  and or the assets of the owner 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which  in turn  would reduce the owner s revenues 
although our leases and mortgage loans require the lessee and the mortgagor to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities  the scope of such obligations may be limited  and we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
this competition may prevent us from raising prices at the same pace as our costs increase 
we compete for additional healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other reits 
the operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care facilities for the support of the medical community  including physicians and acute care hospitals  as well as the general public 
some significant competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing facilities include quality of care  reputation  physical appearance of the facilities  services offered  family preferences  physician services and price 
if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors  the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates 
we are named as defendants in litigation arising out of professional liability and general liability claims relating to our previously owned and operated facilities which if decided against us  could adversely affect our financial condition 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities 
other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages  against the defendants 
the lawsuits are in various stages of discovery and we are unable to predict the likely outcome at this time 
we continue to vigorously defend these claims and pursue all rights we may have against the managers of the facilities  under the terms of the management agreements 
we have insured these matters  subject to self insured retentions of various amounts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense of these matters or in asserting our claims against various managers of the subject facilities or that the amount of any settlement or judgment will be substantially covered by insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance 
we are subject to significant anti takeover provisions 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain various procedural and other requirements which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is divided into three classes and our board members are elected for terms that are staggered 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the preferences  rights and limitations of the preferred stock without stockholder approval 
we have also adopted a stockholders rights plan which provides for share purchase rights to become exercisable at a discount if a person or group acquires more than of our common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer for more than of our common stock 
these provisions could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  which could adversely affect the market price of our securities 
we may change our investment strategies and policies and capital structure 
our board of directors  without the approval of our stockholders  may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines in the future that a change is in our and our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed 
if we fail to maintain our reit status  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we were organized to qualify for taxation as a real estate investment trust  or reit  under sections through of the internal revenue code 
we believe we have conducted  and we intend to continue to conduct  our operations so as to qualify as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements  some on an annual and some on a quarterly basis  established under highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  each year we must distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income 
we cannot assure you that we will at all times satisfy these rules and tests 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  as a result of a determination that we failed to meet the annual distribution requirement or otherwise  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
this treatment would reduce our net earnings and cash flow available for investment  debt service or distribution to stockholders because of our additional tax liability for the years involved 
in addition  distributions to stockholders would no longer be required to be made 
we hedge floating rate debt with an interest rate cap  and may record charges associated with the termination or change in value of the interest rate cap 
we utilize one interest rate cap to reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
we will assess the probability that our expected future floating rate debt is sufficient for our cap and may recognize a charge to earnings to reverse amounts previously recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
risks related to our stock the market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors 
the share price of our stock will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including o the market for similar securities issued by reits  o changes in estimates by analysts  o our ability to meet analysts estimates  o general economic and financial market conditions  and o our financial condition  performance and prospects 
our issuance of additional capital stock  warrants or debt securities  whether or not convertible  may reduce the market price for our shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our capital stock  warrants or debt securities  or the availability of our securities for future sale  will have on the market price of our shares  including our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred shares  warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price of our stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional capital stock in the future to raise capital or as a result of the following o the issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we may in the future issue additional options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock under our stock incentive plan  as amended  or other remuneration plans 
we may also issue options or convertible securities to our employees in lieu of cash bonuses or to our directors in lieu of director s fees 
o the issuance of debt securities exchangeable for our common stock 
o the exercise of warrants we may issue in the future 
o lenders sometimes ask for warrants or other rights to acquire shares in connection with providing financing 
we cannot assure you that our lenders will not request such rights 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in  our board of directors suspended dividends on our common stock and all series of preferred stock in an effort to generate cash to address then impending debt maturities 
in  we paid all accrued but unpaid dividends on all series of preferred stock and reinstated dividends on our common stock and all series of preferred stock 
however  our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if any of the risks described above were to occur 
our payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our bank credit facilities and our preferred stock 
all dividends will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in addition  our dividends in the past have included  and may in the future include  a return of capital 
holders of our outstanding preferred stock have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred stock that may have dividend  liquidation and other rights that are senior to those of our common stock 
as of february    shares of our series a cumulative preferred stock   shares of our series b cumulative preferred stock and  shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
holders of our preferred stock are generally entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common stock 
upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up  before any payment is made to holders of our common stock  holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of per share with respect to the series a  series b and series d preferred stock  plus any accrued and unpaid distributions 
this will reduce the remaining amount of our assets  if any  available to distribute to holders of our common stock 
in addition  holders of our preferred stock have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors if six quarterly preferred dividends are in arrears 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect purchasers of our stock 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of the federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock 
changes are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure you that any of these changes will not adversely affect our stockholder s stock 
any of these changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on market value or resale potential 
stockholders are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the impact that recent legislation may have on your investment and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect 
recent changes in taxation of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our stock 
the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of that was enacted into law on may   among other things  generally reduces to the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from a regular c corporation 
this reduced tax rate  however  will not apply to dividends paid to individuals by a reit on its shares  except for certain limited amounts 
while the earnings of a reit that are distributed to its stockholders still generally will be subject to less combined federal income taxation than earnings of a non reit c corporation that are distributed to its stockholders net of corporate level tax  this legislation could cause individual investors to view the stock of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to the shares of a reit than was the case prior to the enactment of the legislation 
individual investors could hold this view because the dividends from regular c corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from reits will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual s other ordinary income 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  the enactment of this legislation may have on the value of the shares of reits in general or on the value of our stock in particular  either in terms of price or relative to other investments 
item properties at december   our real estate investments included long term care facilities and rehabilitation hospital investments  either in the form of purchased facilities which are leased to operators  mortgages on facilities which are operated by the mortgagors or their affiliates and one facility owned and operated for our account

our leased real estate properties are leased under provisions of single facility leases or master leases with initial terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
substantially all of the master leases provide for minimum annual rentals that are subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying properties  with certain limits 
under the terms of the leases  the lessee is responsible for all maintenance  repairs  taxes and insurance on the leased properties 
at december   we had one owned and operated facility which is subject to governmental regulation and derives a substantial portion of its net operating revenues from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
this facility is managed by an independent third party under a management contract 
the manager is responsible for the day to day operations of the facility  including  among other things  patient care  staffing  billing and collection of patient accounts and facility level financial reporting 
for its services  the manager is paid a management fee based on a percentage of nursing home revenues 
we leased this facility to an operator effective january  and  as of the date of this report  we have no owned and operated facilities in our portfolio 
see note properties to our audited consolidated financial statements 
item legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
while any legal proceeding or claim has an element of uncertainty  management believes that the outcome of each lawsuit claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened  or all of them combined  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on june   we were named as a defendant in certain litigation brought against us in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan  detroit division  by madison ohi liquidity investors  llc madison  for the breach and or anticipatory breach of a revolving loan commitment 
ronald m 
dickerman and bryan gordon are partners in madison and limited guarantors guarantors of madison s obligations to us 
effective as of september   the parties settled all claims in the suit in consideration of madison s payment of the sum of million consisting of a million cash payment for our attorneys fees  with the balance evidenced by the amendment of the existing promissory note from madison to us 
the note reflects a principal balance of million  with interest accruing at per annum  payable over three years upon liquidation of the collateral securing the note 
the note is also fully guaranteed by the guarantors  provided that if all accrued interest and of original principal has been repaid within months  the guarantors will be released 
accordingly  a reserve of million was recorded in relating to this note 
as of december   the principal balance on this note was million prior to reserves 
in  we filed suit against a title company later adding a law firm as a defendant  seeking damages based on claims of breach of contract and negligence  among other things  as a result of the alleged failure to file certain uniform commercial code ucc financing statements in our favor 
we filed a subsequent suit seeking recovery under title insurance policies written by the title company 
the defendants denied the allegations made in the lawsuits 
in settlement of our claims against the defendants  we agreed in the first quarter of to accept a lump sum cash payment of million 
the cash proceeds were offset by related expenses incurred of million resulting in a net gain of million 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants in professional liability claims related to our formerly owned and operated facilities 
other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages against the defendants 
the lawsuits are in various stages of discovery and we are unable to predict the likely outcome at this time 
we continue to vigorously defend these claims and pursue all rights we may have against the managers of the facilities  under the terms of the management agreements  which include  among other matters  the requirement that the operators indemnify us against all losses  cost  fines and related expenses arising out of such matters 
we also maintain insurance against such claims  subject to self insured retentions of various amounts 
there can be no assurance that the operators will fulfill their obligations to indemnify us or that such insurance will be available to fund any losses or settlements arising as a result of such claims

overview as of december   our portfolio consisted of healthcare facilities  located in states and operated by third party operators 
our gross investment in these facilities  net of impairments  totaled million at december   with of our real estate investments related to long term care facilities 
our portfolio is made up of long term healthcare facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals owned and leased to third parties  fixed rate mortgages on long term healthcare facilities  one long term healthcare facility that was recovered from a customer and was operated through a third party management contract for our own account and six long term healthcare facilities that were recovered from customers and are currently closed 
at december   we also held miscellaneous investments of approximately million 
nearly all of our properties are used as healthcare facilities  therefore  we are directly affected by the risk associated with the healthcare industry 
our lessees and mortgagors  as well as any facilities owned and operated for our own account  derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these programs are highly regulated by federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations and subject to frequent and substantial change 
the balanced budget act of balanced budget act significantly reduced spending levels for the medicare and medicaid programs 
due to the implementation of the terms of the balanced budget act  effective july   the majority of skilled nursing facilities shifted from payments based on reasonable cost to a prospective payment system for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
under the prospective payment system  skilled nursing facilities are paid on a per diem prospective case mix adjusted basis for all covered services 
implementation of the prospective payment system has affected each long term care facility to a different degree  depending upon the amount of revenue it derives from medicare patients 
legislation adopted in and increased medicare payments to nursing facilities and specialty care facilities on an interim basis 
section of the balanced budget relief act of balanced budget relief act included a increase for patient acuity categories known as resource utilization groups rugs and a across the board increase of the adjusted federal per diem payment rate 
the increase was implemented in april and will remain in effect until the implementation of refinements in the current rug case mix classification system to more accurately estimate the cost of non therapy ancillary services 
the increase was implemented in april and expired october  the benefits improvement and protection act of benefits improvement and protection act included a increase in the nursing component of the case mix adjusted federal periodic payment rate and a increase in the rug payments for rehabilitation therapy services 
the increase was implemented in april and expired october  the increase is an adjustment to the increase granted in the balance budget relief act and spreads the funds directed at three of those rugs to an additional rehabilitation rugs 
the increase was implemented in april and will remain in effect until the implementation of refinements in the current rug case mix classification system 
the expiration of the and increases under these statutes as of october  has had an adverse impact on the revenues of the operators of nursing facilities and has negatively impacted some operators ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
medicare reimbursement could be further reduced when the centers for medicare medicaid services cms completes its rug refinement  thereby triggering the sunset of the temporary and increases also established under these statutes 
on august   cms published the payment rates for snfs for federal fiscal year effective on october  
cms announced that the snf update would be a increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year in addition  cms announced that the two temporary payment increases the and add ons for certain payment categories will continue to be effective for federal fiscal year also in the august  announcement  cms confirmed its intention to incorporate a forecast error adjustment that takes into account previous years update errors 
according to cms  there was a cumulative snf market basket  or inflation adjustment  forecast error of for federal fiscal years through as a result  cms has increased the national payment rate by an additional above the increase for federal fiscal year due to the temporary nature of the and payment increases established under the balanced budget relief act and benefits improvement and protection act  we cannot be assured that the federal reimbursement will remain at levels comparable to present levels and that such reimbursement will be sufficient for our lessees or mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs necessary to care for medicare and medicaid patients 
we also cannot be assured that there will be any future legislation to increase payment rates for skilled nursing facilities 
if payment rates for skilled nursing facilities are not increased in the future  some of our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us 
in addition  each state has its own medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state and federal government 
federal law governs how each state manages its medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit the needs and resources of its citizens 
rising medicaid costs and decreasing state revenues caused by current economic conditions have prompted an increasing number of states to cut or consider reductions in medicaid funding as a means of balancing their respective state budgets 
existing and future initiatives affecting medicaid reimbursement may reduce utilization of and reimbursement for services offered by the operators of our properties 
in early  many states announced actual or potential budget shortfalls 
as a result of these budget shortfalls  many states have announced that they are implementing or considering implementing freezes or cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates  including rates paid to snf providers  or reductions in medicaid enrollee benefits  including long term care benefits 
we cannot predict the extent to which medicaid rate freezes or cuts or benefit reductions will ultimately be adopted  the number of states that will adopt them nor the impact of such adoption on our operators 
however  extensive medicaid rate cuts or freezes or benefit reductions could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and results of operations  which could affect adversely their ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us 
on may   the federal jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act tax relief act was signed into law  which included an increase in medicaid federal funding for five fiscal quarters april  through june  
in addition  the tax relief act provides state fiscal relief for federal fiscal years and to assist states with funding shortfalls 
it is anticipated that these temporary federal funding provisions could mitigate state medicaid funding reductions through federal fiscal year in addition  private payors  including managed care payors  are increasingly demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk of operating a healthcare facility 
efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement levels could adversely affect the revenues of our lessees and mortgagors and thereby adversely affect those lessees and mortgagors abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
at december   we owned three long term healthcare facilities that had been recovered from customers and were operated for our own account 
during and  we experienced a significant increase in nursing home revenues attributable to the increase in owned and operated assets 
during  these increases abated as we re leased  sold or closed all but one of these facilities 
in addition  in connection with the recovery of these assets  we often fund working capital and deferred capital expenditure needs for a transitional period until license transfers and other regulatory matters are completed and reimbursement from third party payors recommences 
as of january   we had sold or re leased all of the owned and operated facilities in our portfolio and had six closed facilities in our portfolio our management intends to sell these assets as promptly as possible  consistent with achieving valuations that reflect our management s estimate of fair value of the assets 
we do not know  however  if  or when  the dispositions will be completed or whether the dispositions will be completed on terms that will enable us to realize the fair value of such assets 
the following significant highlights occurred during the twelve month period ended december  financing o in june  we obtained a million senior secured credit facility credit facility to repay borrowings under our two previous credit facilities  replace letters of credit and pay cumulative unpaid preferred dividends 
o in december  we secured a million acquisition credit facility  which we believe  combined with the million credit facility and cash on hand  will provide us the flexibility to initiate a growth strategy in dividends o in july  our board of directors declared a full catch up of cumulative  unpaid dividends and regular quarterly dividends for all classes of preferred stock and such dividends were paid on august  to preferred stockholders of record on august  o in september  our board of directors reinstated our common stock dividend and a dividend of per share of common stock was paid on november  to common stockholders of record on october  re leasing o in march  we re leased nine skilled nursing facilities snfs formerly operated by integrated health services  inc to four unaffiliated third party operators 
o in july  we amended our master lease with a subsidiary of alterra healthcare corporation alterra whereby the number of leased facilities was reduced from eight to five 
o in november  we re leased two snfs formerly leased by claremont healthcare holdings  inc claremont  located in ohio and representing beds  to a new operator under a master lease 
o throughout  we re leased snfs formerly operated by sun to six unaffiliated third party operators 
asset sales o in may  we sold an investment in a baltimore  maryland asset  leased by the united states postal service usps  for approximately million 
the purchaser paid us proceeds of million and assumed the first mortgage of approximately million 
o in december  we sold one snf formerly leased by claremont  located in illinois and representing beds  for million 
we received net proceeds of approximately million in cash and a million  five year  secured note for the balance 
we also sold our investment in principal healthcare finance trust for proceeds of approximately million 
o throughout  we sold eight closed facilities and four assets held for sale for proceeds of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified six significant accounting policies which we believe are critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are revenue recognition rental income and mortgage interest income are recognized as earned over the terms of the related master leases and mortgage notes  respectively 
such income includes periodic increases based on pre determined formulas ie  such as increases in the consumer price index cpi as defined in the master leases and mortgage loan agreements 
reserves are taken against earned revenues from leases and mortgages when collection of amounts due become questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations regarding ultimate collection 
when collection is uncertain  lease revenues are recorded as received  after taking into account application of security deposits 
interest income on impaired mortgage loans is recognized as received after taking into account application of security deposits 
nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets primarily medicare  medicaid and other third party insurance are recognized as patient services are provided 
asset impairment management periodically but not less than annually evaluates the real estate investments for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if indicators of impairment are present  management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities 
provisions for impairment losses related to long lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow  including sales proceeds  is less than carrying value  then an adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the leased properties and other long lived assets to the present value of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
the fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
loan impairment management periodically but not less than annually evaluates the outstanding loans and notes receivable 
when management identifies potential loan impairment indicators  such as non payment under the loan documents  impairment of the underlying collateral  financial difficulty of the operator or other circumstances that may impair full execution of the loan documents  then the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows 
in cases where expected future cash flows cannot be estimated  the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the loan is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consists primarily of lease and mortgage interest payments 
amounts recorded include estimated provisions for loss related to uncollectible accounts and disputed items 
on a monthly basis  we review the contractual payment versus actual cash payment received and the contractual payment due date versus actual receipt date

accounts receivable owned and operated assets accounts receivable from owned and operated assets consist of amounts due from medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  a decrease of million from revenues 
when excluding nursing home revenues of owned and operated assets  revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the comparable prior year period 
the decrease during the year was primarily the result of operator restructurings  the sale of our investment in a baltimore  maryland asset leased by the usps  partially offset by a legal settlement

we filed a subsequent suit seeking recovery under title insurance policies written by the title company 
the defendants denied the allegations made in the lawsuits 
in settlement of our claims against the defendants  we agreed in the first quarter of to accept a lump sum cash payment of million 
the cash proceeds were offset by related expenses incurred of million resulting in a net gain of million 
we believe that the presentation of our revenues and expenses  excluding nursing home owned and operated assets  provides a useful measure of the operating performance of our core portfolio as a real estate investment trust reit in view of the disposition of all but one of our owned and operated assets as of december  expenses our expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  decreasing approximately million from expenses of million during when excluding nursing home expenses of owned and operated assets  expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the comparable prior year period 
the decrease during the year was primarily the result of million of lower interest expense  million favorable reduction in general and administrative and legal expenses  million favorable reduction in provision for uncollectible mortgages  notes and accounts receivable  off set by an increase of million in provision for impairment and million in adjustments of derivatives to fair value 
our nursing home expenses  net of nursing home revenues  for owned and operated assets decreased to million from million in due to the releasing efforts  sales and or closures during the year

effective january   our remaining owned and operated asset was re leased to an existing operator 
this facility  located in illinois  was re leased under a new master lease which encompasses four additional facilities 
an analysis of significant changes in our expenses during the years ended december  and is as follows o our general and administrative expenses for totaled million as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease is due to lower consulting costs  primarily related to the owned and operated facilities and cost reductions due to reduced staffing  travel and other employee related expenses 
o our legal expenses for totaled million as compared to million in the decrease is largely attributable to a reduction of legal costs associated with our owned and operated facilities due to the releasing efforts  sales and or closures of owned and operated assets since december  o our interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared with million for the decrease in is due to lower average borrowings on our credit facilities as well as the impact of our current year refinancings and the payoff in of million of notes that matured in june o in  we recognized a million refinancing expense as we were unable to complete a planned commercial mortgage backed securities transaction due to the impact on our operators resulting from reductions in medicare reimbursement and concerns about potential medicaid rate reductions

diluted funds from operations is the lower of funds from operations and funds from operations adjusted for the assumed conversion of series c preferred stock and the exercise of in the money stock options 
we consider funds from operations to be one performance measure which is helpful to investors of real estate companies because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and to make expenditures 
funds from operations in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the market value of our long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages are subject to interest rate risks 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
we utilize interest rate swaps and caps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  we may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
we may employ swaps  forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying forecasted transactions 
gains and losses related to these transactions are deferred and recognized in net income as interest expense in the same period or periods that the underlying transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
gaap requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedge item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
in september  we entered into a month  million interest rate cap with a strike of that has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the cap agreement  when libor exceeds  the counterparty will pay us million multiplied by the difference between libor and times the number of days when libor exceeds 
the unrealized gain loss in the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported on the balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income 
on december   the derivative instrument was reported at its fair value of million 
an adjustment of million to other comprehensive income was made for the change in fair value of this cap during over the term of the interest rate cap  the million cost will be amortized to earnings based on the specific portion of the total cost attributed to each monthly settlement period 
over the next twelve months  million is expected to be reclassified to earnings from other comprehensive income 
in september  we terminated two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each 
under the terms of the first swap agreement  which would have expired in december  we received payments when libor exceeded and paid the counterparty when libor was less than
