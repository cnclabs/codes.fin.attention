item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s environmental and bodily injury matters 
safety matters the company is also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act osha and similar state statutes 
the company has an extensive health and safety program and employs a staff of safety inspectors whose primary functions are to develop company policies that meet or exceed the safety standards set by osha  train production supervisors and make periodic inspections of safety procedures to insure compliance with company policies on safety and industrial hygiene 
all shipyard employees are required to attend regularly scheduled safety training meetings 
backlog at march  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at march  and march   respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s navy and coast guard phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy and the us coast guard  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  the decrease in the backlog is primarily due to the timing of the availabilities for the phased maintenance contracts 
projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are exercised by these customers 
investments and acquisitions the company routinely evaluates suitable investment opportunities that it believes will appropriately utilize the company s resources 
however  the company has no present plans to make any direct investments in other businesses  either related or unrelated to ship repair and overhaul activities 
item properties the company is required to maintain navy certification on its drydocks and cranes in order to be eligible to bid on and perform work under certain navy and united states coast guard coast guard contracts 
throughout fiscal year  the company maintained all required certifications 
the design capacities of the company s two remaining drydocks  both of which are located at the shipyard  are as follows year type owned leased max 
design date of lease name built capacity in tons expiration emerald sea steel x  yfd steel x  yfd  a ton capacity wooden drydock built in that the company had leased from the navy since november   sank in heavy weather on october  after considerable effort  todd raised yfd on october  but the drydock required continuous pumping to keep afloat and remains out of service 
based on the estimated costs of repairing the damage sustained in the sinking  the drydock was declared a total constructive loss as of november   and the lease was thereby terminated as of that date 
the company maintained insurance coverage on yfd and the costs associated with raising the drydock  less the applicable deductible  were covered under the insurance policies 
insurance covering the total constructive loss of the drydock is payable to the navy 
the company evaluates its plans for future operations of its remaining leased dry dock when the lease expiration date falls within the next operating cycle 
the lease terms on drydock yfd contain a nominal annual lease payment and a minimum amount of annual maintenance that the company must perform 
the lease also includes minimum levels of maintenance that the company must perform during the life of the lease 
the company has included the nominal annual lease payment and the average annual maintenance cost that must be performed over the life of the lease on drydock yfd in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 
the company s current navy drydock certifications are for amounts that are less than the drydocks maximum design capacity  however they are sufficient to allow the company to perform work on all non nuclear navy vessels homeported in puget sound  as well as on all coast guard and washington state ferry vessels 
the company believes that its owned and leased properties at the shipyard are in reasonable operating condition given their age and usage  although the company has from time to time been required to incur substantial expenditures to ensure the continuing serviceability of certain owned and leased machinery and equipment 
towards the end of fiscal year  the company determined that such serviceability repairs would be required on the emerald sea to maintain navy certification on a long term basis 
certain time sensitive repairs began early in fiscal year  while the company evaluated several alternative repair scenarios and management s plans for future operations 
once the company completed its evaluation in fiscal year  a comprehensive  multi year refurbishment plan was approved by management that would allow the company to maintain navy certification into the future 
this multi year plan included scheduled refurbishment periods so repairs did not interfere with the on going shipyard operations 
with the de commissioning of the uss sacramento  transfer of the uss bridge and uss rainier to the military sealift command and the uncertainties concerning the navy s intent to do future repairs on the uss camden  the company is re evaluating its emerald sea refurbishment plan 
the company will continue to assess the plan in light of its future drydock requirements and will make appropriate changes as needed to support shipyard operations 
also  the company performed an impairment analysis of the emerald sea and determined that this dry dock is not impaired 
early in fiscal year  the company announced a special capital budget of approximately million for planned improvements to its seattle shipyard facility during its fiscal years and these improvements include the replacement of a major pier  a stormwater collection and discharge system and significant upgrades to its electrical system and are in addition to the company s routine annual capital expenditures 
during fiscal year  the company spent approximately million of the special facilities capital budget  and million on other shipyard capital expenditures

harbor island site the company and several other parties have been named as potentially responsible parties prps by the environmental protection agency the epa pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla also known as superfund in connection with the documented release or threatened release of hazardous substances  pollutants and contaminants at the harbor island superfund site the harbor island site  upon which the shipyard is located 
harbor island site insurance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that provides the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of all of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount exceeding the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the second payment was made in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable in accordance with its environmental accounting policies at the time it entered into this agreement 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
harbor island site history to date  the epa has separated the harbor island site into three operable units that affect the company the soil and groundwater unit the soil unit  the shipyard sediments operable unit the ssou and the sediments operable unit the sou 
the company  along with a number of other harbor island prps  received a special notice letter from the epa on may  pursuant to section e of cercla 
the company entered into a consent decree for the soil unit in september under which the company has agreed to remediate the designated contamination on its property 
removal of floating petroleum product from the water table began in october and is anticipated to continue through fiscal year the company and the epa are currently negotiating the extent and methodology of the soil remediation 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa issued its record of decision rod for the ssou 
the rod identifies four alternative solutions for the ssou remediation and identifies the epa s selected remedy 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa expanded the boundaries of the ssou issuing their phase b data report and resulting explanation of significant differences outlining the changes to the rod 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent for the development of the remedial design for the ssou 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into a consent decree for the cleanup of the ssou  which  along with the associated remedial design statement of work for remedial action sow  was subsequently approved by the department of justice 
the consent decree provides for the submittal of the remedial action work plan to the epa subsequent to the approval by the epa of the final design 
the remedial action work plan will provide for construction and implementation of the remedy set forth in the rod  the two explanation of significant differences issued in fiscal years and  the sow  and the design plans and specifications developed in accordance with the remedial action work plan and approved by the epa 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company submitted its final design report to the epa for the ssou 
the final design report provides for the following actions to take place at the ssou piers and south located on the duwamish waterway will be demolished and removed from the site to achieve more complete cleanup in those areas 
dredging of all contaminated sediments and shipyard waste in the open areas of the ssou surrounding the shipyard and in the areas beneath piers and south 
the total estimated volume of sediments to be removed is  cubic yards 
disposal of all recovered sediment and shipyard waste at an appropriate upland disposal facility 
backfilling of portions of the areas dredged to create inter tidal habitat where feasible 
capping of areas beneath the piers that are not scheduled for demolition to an average thickness of one foot 
pursuant to the current schedule  remediation of the ssou is expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal current environmental regulations limit the period of time during the year that dredging may occur 
given these limits  dredging in the ssou will require several years to complete 
the current estimated cost of the ssou cleanup is included in the environmental reserve 
during january  the company was notified by the epa that testing would be required in the west waterway of the duwamish river outside the borders of the ssou as part of the sou 
during may  the company entered into an administrative order on consent to perform certain limited testing as part of the sou investigation 
after an evaluation of the results  the epa issued a draft no action rod on the sou for public comment which if issued in final form would end the investigation of the sou  requiring no remedial action 
the public comment period closed during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year in september  the epa issued the final no action rod on the sou 
given the epa s issuance of the draft no action rod in fiscal year  the company had not established a reserve for any remediation on the sou 
under the federal superfund law  potentially responsible parties may have liability for damages to natural resources in addition to liability for remediation 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company began discussions with the natural resource trustees trustees for the harbor island superfund site site and continued these discussions during the remainder of fiscal year the company anticipates that the trustees will file a claim against the company at some future date alleging damages to the natural resources at the site caused by the release of hazardous substances 
the best estimate of a potential natural resource damage claim has been included in the environmental reserve 
the payment of any eventual claim is covered by the aforementioned insurance policy  except for the policy deductible  provided that aggregate policy limits have not been exceeded 
the amount of the policy deductible payment is reflected in the company s environmental reserve at march  other environmental remediation matters in january  the epa issued special notice letters naming the prps on the hylebos waterway operable unit of the commencement bay superfund site in tacoma  washington 
the company was not included on the epa s list 
todd has been notified by other prps of their intent to bring a contribution action against the company 
subsidiaries of the company had a presence on the site from and again from  for the most part  coinciding with world wars i and ii when the company built war ships at the direction of the united states government 
several parties in hired an allocator to assign percentages of responsibility to all parties  historical and present  notwithstanding potential defenses or contractual claims 
while the company did not participate in the allocation process  the allocator s findings were taken into account in including an estimate of potential liability in the company s reserve discussed below 
the company has further been notified by the commencement bay natural resource trustees trustees that the parties occupying the aforementioned property subsequent to have been allocated liability for natural resource damages 
while the trustees have not submitted a claim against the company for natural resource damages  they have invited the company to participate in a mediation with the prps to resolve intra facility allocation issues 
the company is investigating the potential of any liability it may currently have for its presence on the site during world wars i and ii when it built war ships at the direction of the united states government 
the company entered into a consent decree with the epa for the clean up of the casmalia resources hazardous waste management facility in santa barbara county  california under the resource conservation and recovery act 
the company has included an estimate of the potential liability for this site in environmental reserves as discussed below 
immaterial payments began in fiscal year and will extend for up to ten years 
asbestos related claims and insurance the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
the cases generally include as defendants  in addition to the company  other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all other claims of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of march  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against the company 
the previously stated claimants is the company s best estimate taking known facts into consideration 
approximately claimants do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately claims contain standard boilerplate language asserting on behalf of each claimant a claim for compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million against approximately defendants 
approximately claims set forth the same boilerplate language asserting million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately claimants seek compensatory damages of less than  per claim and approximately claimants seek compensatory damages between million and million 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants which claims are made or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  the company has not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
as a result of claims resolution during fiscal year  bodily injury reserves declined from million at march  to million at march  likewise  bodily injury insurance receivables declined from million to million 
these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgment of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as the years remaining calculation set forth below indicates  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at march   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s costs related to subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements may increase 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the following chart indicates the number of claims filed and resolved in the past three fiscal years  including the number of claims yet to be resolved at the end of each fiscal year 
resolution includes settlements  adjudications and dismissals 
the claims are further categorized as either malignant or non malignant 
bodily injury claims non malignant malignant total outstanding  april  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  march  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  march  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  march  due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity

item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations the notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction herewith 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may impact results for future periods  are discussed below under the captions overview profitability  and environmental matters 
readers should also consider the statements and factors discussed under the caption operations overview in item and the discussion of environmental matters and related bodily injury claims set forth in item of this annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission for the fiscal year ended march   together with the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year then ended 
overview fiscal year started slowly  primarily because the company s scheduled work for the navy during the first quarter was postponed by ship deployments in support of military operations in iraq 
however  the company s revenue increased significantly during the second quarter of the year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a large concentration of repair  maintenance and overhaul work that was awarded under each of the company s three us navy phased maintenance contracts as the previously deployed ships returned home 
during this same period  the company s commercial and non navy repair business was somewhat reduced  in part due to drydock maintenance projects that removed two of the company s docks from service for approximately days each 
during the first half of fiscal year  the company recorded million  or of its full year revenue 
the company s operating and net income during the six month period were unfavorable because of the limited amount of navy work in the first quarter  the impact of the reduced work on the company s commercial and non navy results  and the impact of the million provision for workers compensation claims arising from the bankruptcy of fremont indemnity company  the company s former workers compensation insurance carrier 
the financial results for the third and fourth quarters of this year were significantly stronger as revenues for the second half of the year increased to million  an increase of from the volumes experienced during the first half of the year 
a significant portion of the increased revenues  operating income and net income experienced in the second half of the year was attributable to the high volume of navy work that had been previously deferred due to military operations in iraq 
in spite of the improvement in the financial results for the second half  the company s results were somewhat diminished by the navy s decision to reduce the scope of work the company performed on the uss sacramento because of the ship s pending decommissioning 
in addition  the company experienced higher direct costs than planned on a fixed priced project that commenced in the third quarter and was completed early in the company s fiscal year the impact of these cost increases  which had no corresponding revenue associated with them  reduced operating income by approximately million 
for the full year ended march   the company recorded revenue of million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from fiscal year reported revenue of million 
this revenue decrease is primarily attributable to reduced commercial and other non navy work volumes 
during fiscal year  the company recorded operating income of million on revenue of million  or approximately of revenue 
this represents a decrease in operating income of million  or approximately from fiscal year operating income of million 
the decline in operating income was due to the previously mentioned reduced commercial and other non navy volumes  higher direct costs on a fixed priced project  a non cash charge arising from the provision for anticipated workers compensation claim costs due to the bankruptcy of the company s former workers compensation insurance carrier  and higher overhead expenses 
in addition  the company recognized a million gain on available for sale securities and million in non operating investment income for the year ended march  these amounts in addition to the operating income reported  resulted in fiscal year income before income tax expense of million 
auxiliary oiler explosive aoe contract in june  the company was awarded by the navy  a six year  cost type contract  under which the navy has options to have the company perform maintenance work on the auxiliary oiler explosive aoe class vessels 
this contract represents the fourth consecutive  multi year contract that the company has been awarded by the navy on the aoe class vessels 
the three previous aoe contracts  which were each five years in duration  were all awarded on a competitive basis 
this cost type contract provides for phased maintenance repairs to four navy aoe class supply ships stationed in the puget sound area 
the original contract included options for thirteen repair availabilities to be performed between and and was expected to have a notional value of approximately million if all of the options were exercised 
since the award  five repair availabilities have been accomplished 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the navy announced its intention to transfer the uss rainier aoe and the uss bridge aoe to the military sealift command msc which results in five availabilities that will not be exercised under this contract 
aoe was transferred to msc in august aoe is currently scheduled to be transferred in the summer of the company anticipates that msc will contract for future work on these two vessels on a competitive basis 
the potential impact of these transfers on the company s future revenues will depend on such factors as the expenditures for maintenance by msc  the company s capacity to bid on future aoe and aoe work  and the company s bidding success if such bids are submitted 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company announced that it was informed by the navy that the uss sacramento aoe is scheduled to be decommissioned on or about october  of the two remaining availabilities on aoe  one was exercised on a reduced scale as a five week  pier side availability 
the availability  originally scheduled for weeks in duration  was to include a dry docking of the ship 
the other availability of aoe will not occur due to its decommissioning 
the company does not know at this point if it will be involved in any of the work related to the decommissioning of aoe the aoe contract contains options for two remaining repair availabilities on the uss camden aoe before the contract expires in there is no assurance that these two remaining options will be exercised by the navy in whole or in part

business volume and backlog at march  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at march  and march   respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s navy and coast guard phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy and the us coast guard  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  the decrease in the backlog is primarily due to the timing of the availabilities for the phased maintenance contracts 
projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are exercised by these customers 
profitability the company s future profitability depends largely on the ability of the shipyard to maintain an adequate volume of ship repair  overhaul and conversion business to augment its longer term contracts 
the variables affecting the company s business volume include public support provided to competing northwest shipyards  excess west coast and industry wide shipyard capacity  foreign competition  governmental legislation and regulatory issues  activity levels of the us navy  competitors pricing behavior  and company labor efficiencies  work practices and estimating abilities 
other factors that can contribute to future profitability include the amounts of annual expenditures needed to ensure continuing serviceability of the company s owned and leased machinery and equipment 
the company continues to respond aggressively to the increasingly competitive shipbuilding and repair industry 
in addition to management s focus on the profitability of existing shipyard operations through reduced operating costs  improved production efficiencies  customer needs and the pursuit of new business volume  management continues to evaluate options for deployment of assets with a view to improving the company s return on investment 
critical accounting policies the company s established accounting policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this form k entitled principal accounting policies 
as part of its reporting responsibilities  management continually evaluates and reviews the adequacy of its accounting policies and methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies are applied in a consistent manner that provides the user of the company s financial statements with a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how these judgments and estimates can impact the company s financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that management believes may contain difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the company s results of operation 
the company has identified its most critical accounting policies as those which relate to revenue recognition  environmental remediation  bodily injury  other reserves  and insurance receivable and deferred pension asset and accrued post retirement health benefits 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  contract costs  and profit on the percentage of completion method based upon direct labor hours incurred 
using the percentage of completion method requires the company to make certain estimates of the total cost to complete a project  estimates of project schedule and completion dates  estimates of the percentage at which the project is complete  estimates of annual overhead rates and estimates of amounts of any probable unapproved claims and or change orders 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated by experienced project management and accounting personnel assigned to these activities  and senior management also reviews them on a periodic basis 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  any changes from prior estimates are generally reflected in revenue in the current period 
the company has considerable experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously and in preparing accurate cost estimates  schedules and project completion dates 
however  many factors  including but not limited to weather  fluctuations in material prices  labor shortages  and timely availability of materials can affect the accuracy of these estimates and may impact future revenues either favorably or unfavorably 
us government procurement standards are followed to determine the allowability as well as the allocability of costs charged to government contracts 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are closely scrutinized for compliance with underlying regulatory standards by shipyards personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
other than normal cost accounting issues raised by the dcaa as a result of their regular  ongoing reviews  the company is not aware of any outstanding issues with the dcaa 
environmental remediation  bodily injury  other reserves and insurance receivable the company faces potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at former company facilities that are now closed 
at march   the company maintained aggregate reserves of million for pending claims and assessments relating to these environmental matters  including million associated with the company s seattle shipyard site and million for asbestos or bodily injury related claims 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage on the costs to remediate these environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury claims 
at march   the company had recorded an insurance receivable of million relating to these environmental and bodily injury matters  including million associated with the company s seattle shipyard site and million for bodily injury related claims 
included in the reserves are sediment remediation costs for harbor island of million that are expected to occur in fiscal year these costs are reflected in the company s balance sheet under current liabilities 
likewise  the insurance receivable of million relating to these reserves is reflected in the company s balance sheet under current assets 
the company reviews these matters on a continual basis and revises its estimates of known liabilities and insurance recoveries when appropriate 
the company follows guidance provided in statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities for recording its environmental liabilities and recoveries 
the company accounts for bodily injury liabilities in accordance with financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating environmental remediation liabilities requires judgments and assessments based upon independent professional knowledge  the experience of company management and legal counsel 
environmental liabilities are based on judgments that include calculating the cost of alternative remediation methods and disposal sites  changes in the boundaries of the remediation areas  and the impact of regulatory changes 
bodily injury liabilities are based on judgments that include the number of outstanding claims  the expected outcome of claim litigation and anticipated settlement amounts for open claims based on historical experience 
the company does not accrue liabilities for unknown bodily injury claims that may be asserted in the future due to uncertainties of the number of cases that may be filed and the extent of damages that may be alleged 
the development of liability estimates that support both environmental remediation and bodily injury reserves involve complex matters that include the development of estimates and the use of judgments 
the actual outcome of these matters may differ from company estimates 
to the extent not covered by insurance  increases to environmental remediation and bodily injury liabilities would unfavorably impact future earnings 
the company s insurance recoveries for environmental remediation and bodily injury claims are estimated independently from the associated liabilities and are based on insurance coverages or contractual agreements negotiated with its former insurance companies 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit rating of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both insurance companies will be able to satisfy their respective obligations under the policy or agreement 
however  if this assumption is incorrect and either of these companies is unable to meet its future financial commitments  the company s financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
pension asset and accrued post retirement health benefits the company s employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are governed by financial accounting standards no 
and no 
under these rules  management determines appropriate assumptions about the future  which are used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trends  inflation rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
management bases these assumptions on historical results  the current environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
see note to the financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee pension and other post retirement benefits 
year to year comparisons compared with net income for fiscal year decreased by million  or from fiscal year levels 
this decrease was attributable to the reduced volume of commercial and non navy work  higher overhead expenses  and the non cash charge arising from the provision for anticipated workers compensations claims due to the bankruptcy of one of the company s previous insurance carriers 
this decrease was mostly offset by a decrease in federal income tax expense of million resulting from the resolution in the fourth quarter of certain income tax contingencies that were established in previous years 
revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represents a decrease of million  or approximately  from fiscal year reported revenue of million 
this is primarily attributable to reduced commercial and other non navy work volumes 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year decreased by million  or approximately from fiscal year the majority of this decrease was attributable to decreases in work volumes experienced in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to a charge recorded in the first quarter related to the unanticipated bankruptcy of one of the company s previous insurance carriers 
this charge  which reflects the company s best estimate of the known liabilities associated with unpaid workers compensation claims arising from the two year coverage period commencing october  is subject to change as additional facts are uncovered 
although the company expects to recover a least a portion of these costs from the liquidation and other sources  the amount and the timing of any such recovery cannot be estimated currently and therefore no estimate of amounts recoverable is included in the current financial results 
administrative and manufacturing overhead overhead costs for administrative and manufacturing activities increased by million  or from fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage revenue was approximately and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in administrative and manufacturing overhead costs and as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increases in repair and maintenance expenses for the company s dry docks  and expenses associated with recovery and maintaining the condition of the smaller of the company s two dry docks that are leased from the us navy 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company received partial reimbursement of million and million  respectively from another harbor island potentially responsible party for certain past environmental costs incurred by the company 
this partial reimbursement is reflected in other insurance settlements in the consolidated statement of income for the years ended march  and march  during fiscal year  the company estimated that the expected remediation costs associated with the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site would increase by approximately million 
this increase in environmental reserves was offset by a million increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the net amount of million is reflected in the company s operating results for fiscal year and is shown in the consolidated statements of income under provision for environmental and other reserves 
investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year increased by million or approximately when compared to fiscal year the increase in investment and other income reported during fiscal year is primarily attributable to accelerated lease payments of million received by the company from one of its warehouse tenants under the terms of a negotiated lease buyout initiated by the tenant 
in both fiscal year and fiscal year  the company s average funds available for investment purposes were million 
gain on sale of available for sale securities during fiscal year  the company reported a net gain of million on the sale of available for sale securities  which is an increase of million 
the significant increase in gains on the sale of available for sale securities reported in fiscal year is primarily attributable to market conditions that were more favorable during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes in fiscal year  the company recognized federal income tax expense of million 
this represents a decrease of million  or approximately in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year this decrease is attributable to the decrease in income before taxes in fiscal year and the decrease in income tax expense of million resulting from the resolution in the fourth quarter of certain income tax contingencies that were established in previous years 
the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the statutory income tax rates for both fiscal years and were and  respectively 
compared with net income for fiscal year decreased by million  or from fiscal year levels 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in income before taxes of million offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
net income for fiscal year was influenced as a result of the following components revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represents an increase of million  or approximately  over fiscal year reported revenue of million 
us navy phased maintenance contracts accounted for approximately million of this increase  while increases in other commercial and government repair and overhaul activities  and new construction activities accounted for million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or approximately from fiscal year the majority of this increase was attributable to increases in work volumes experienced in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher direct costs on two fixed priced projects that commenced and were completed in the third quarter  as well as underestimating the direct costs to complete a third project that commenced later in the third quarter but was not completed until april the impact of these cost increases  which had no corresponding revenue  increased cost of revenues by approximately million 
also contributing  but to a lesser extent  was a non recurring  non cash charge of million arising from the settlement of a portion of the company s pension liabilities 
this settlement transferred a portion of the company s pension liability to an international labor union organization 
under the provisions of pension accounting  the settlement of these liabilities triggered recognition of certain cumulative differences between pension plan assumptions and actual results 
administrative and manufacturing overhead administrative and manufacturing overhead increased million  or approximately from fiscal year this increase was attributable to an overall increase in production volumes as well as planned maintenance expenses and company initiated process improvement costs 
administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue was approximately in fiscal year  which was consistent with the rate experienced in the prior fiscal year 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year  the company estimated that the expected remediation costs associated with the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site would increase by approximately million 
this increase in environmental reserves was offset by a million increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the net amount of million is reflected in the company s operating results for fiscal year and is shown in the consolidated statements of income under provision for environmental and other reserves 
also  in fiscal year the company received partial reimbursement from another harbor island potentially responsible party for certain past environmental costs incurred by the company 
this partial reimbursement in the amount of million is reflected in other insurance settlements in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended march  in fiscal year  the company estimated that the remediation costs associated with its harbor island site would increase approximately million 
this amount was fully offset by a similar increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the company also received million in reimbursements from another potentially responsible party during fiscal year investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year decreased by million or approximately when compared to fiscal year the decrease in investment and other income reported during fiscal year primarily reflects the reduction in the average funds available for investment purposes during the fiscal year  as well as lower investment yields generally available in the market 
in fiscal year  the company s average funds available for investment purposes were million 
in fiscal year  the average funds available for investment purposes declined million  or  to million 
this decline reflects the results of the company s dutch auction share repurchase of million shares of its common stock that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year this repurchase only affected a portion of the average funds available for investment purposes in fiscal year  but affected the average funds available for the entire fiscal year gain on sale of available for sale securities during fiscal year  the company reported a net loss of thousand on the sale of available for sale securities  which is a decrease of million  or approximately from fiscal year the significant decrease in gains on the sale of available for sale securities reported in fiscal year is primarily attributable to market conditions that were more favorable during fiscal year 
income taxes in fiscal year  the company recognized federal income tax expense of million 
this represents a decrease of million  or approximately in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year this decrease is attributable to the decrease in income before taxes in fiscal year the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and remained relatively unchanged at and  respectively 
the statutory income tax rates for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
differences between effective rates and statutory rates reflect certain non deductible expenses in both years 
environmental matters and other contingencies the company has provided total aggregate reserves of million as of march  for its contingent environmental and bodily injury liabilities 
due to the complexities and extensive history of the company s environmental and bodily injury matters  the amounts and timing of future expenditures is uncertain 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these environmental and bodily injury matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage of the costs to remediate environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury cases 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit rating of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both parties will be able to perform under their respective policy or agreement 
as of march   the company has recorded an insurance receivable of million to reflect the contractual arrangements with several insurance companies to share costs for certain environmental and other matters 
included in the reserves are sediment remediation costs for harbor island of million that are expected to occur in fiscal year these costs are reflected in the company s balance sheet under current liabilities 
likewise  the insurance receivable of million relating to these reserves is reflected in the company s balance sheet under current assets 
the company continues to negotiate with its insurance carriers and certain prior landowners and operators for past and future remediation costs 
the company has not recorded any receivables for any amounts that may be recoverable from such negotiations or other claims 
ongoing operations recurring costs associated with the company s environmental compliance program are not material and are expensed as incurred 
capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance are not material to the company s financial statements 
past activities environmental the company faces significant potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard the harbor island site and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances at company facilities 
information with respect to these contingencies and claims is provided in item in this report 
the company s policy is to accrue costs for environmental matters in the accounting period in which the responsibility is established and the cost is estimable 
the company s estimates of its liabilities for environmental matters are based on evaluations of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the results of negotiations with regulatory authorities 
the company does not discount these liabilities 
in fiscal year  the company spent million for environmental site remediation 
all of these costs are reimbursable to the company through its insurance coverages 
an additional million in environmental site remediation was spent by third party vendors under the direction of the company s management 
these costs were paid directly to the third party vendors under the company s insurance policies 
most of these expenditures were related to the harbor island site 
the company spent approximately million and million on environmental site remediation in fiscal years and  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million and million  respectively  were reimbursable to the company under the company s insurance policies 
in addition to environmental site remediation costs  the company spent a net thousand on bodily injury cases after reimbursement under the company s insurance policies in fiscal year in fiscal year and  the company spent thousand and million  respectively for bodily injury cases after reimbursement under the company s insurance policies 
actual costs to address the harbor island site and other environmental sites and matters will depend upon numerous factors  including the number of parties found liable at each environmental site  the method of remediation  outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcome of litigation  technological developments and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
the company entered into a consent decree with the epa during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result the company increased its harbor island site reserves by an additional million at the end of fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount exceeding the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the second payment was made in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable in accordance with its environmental accounting policies at the time it entered into this agreement 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
past activities asbestos and related claims the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
the cases generally include as defendants  in addition to the company  other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all other claims of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of march  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against the company 
the previously stated claimants is the company s best estimate taking known facts into consideration 
approximately claimants do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately claims contain standard boilerplate language asserting on behalf of each claimant a claim for compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million against approximately defendants 
approximately claims set forth the same boilerplate language asserting million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately claimants seek compensatory damages of less than  per claim and approximately claimants seek compensatory damages between million and million 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants which claims are made or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  the company has not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
as a result of claims resolution during fiscal year  bodily injury reserves declined from million at march  to million at march  likewise  bodily injury insurance receivables declined from million to million 
these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgement of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as the years remaining calculation set forth below indicates  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at march   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s share of responsibility will increase for any subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity 
other reserves during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a reserve of million related to the unanticipated bankruptcy of one of its previous insurance carriers 
the reserve  which reflects the company s best estimate of the known liabilities associated with unpaid workers compensation claims arising from the two year coverage period commencing october   is subject to change as additional facts are uncovered 
these claims have reverted to the company due to the liquidation of the insurance carrier 
although the company expects to recover at least a portion of these costs from the liquidation and other sources  the amount and the timing of any such recovery cannot be estimated currently and therefore no estimate of amounts recoverable is included in the current financial results 
since establishing the reserve during the first quarter  the company has paid approximately million in claims  which have been charged against the reserve 
liquidity  capital resources and working capital at march   the company s cash and cash equivalents  and securities available for sale balances were million and million  respectively  for a total of million 
at march  the company s cash and cash equivalents  and securities available for sale balances were million and million  respectively  for a total of million 
the company anticipates that its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities position  anticipated fiscal year cash flow  access to credit facilities and capital markets  taken together  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for fiscal year accordingly  shipyard capital expenditures are expected to be financed from working capital 
a change in the composition or timing of projected work could cause planned capital expenditures and repair and maintenance expenditures to change 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  this amount was primarily attributable to fiscal year net income adjusted for depreciation  an increase in accounts payable and accruals  a decrease in the insurance receivable offset by an increase in costs and estimated profits in excess of billings on incomplete contracts and a decrease in environmental and other reserves 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  and was primarily attributable to fiscal year net income adjusted for environmental and other reserves and accounts receivable  offset by increases in insurance receivables 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended march  and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended march  and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities 
capital expenditures early in fiscal year  the company announced a special capital budget of approximately million for planned improvements to its seattle shipyard facility during its fiscal years and these improvements include the replacement of a major pier  a stormwater collection and discharge system and significant upgrades to its electrical system and are in addition to the company s routine annual capital expenditures 
during fiscal year  the company spent approximately million of the special facilities capital budget and million on other shipyard capital expenditures 
the company plans to finance these capital projects from its projected future cash flows and existing working capital 
during fiscal year  the company spent approximately million on new capital assets 
the capital expenditures for fiscal year are in addition to ongoing repair and maintenance expenditures in the shipyard of million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year repair and maintenance costs when compared to fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease in direct labor costs associated with the company s multi year refurbishment plan of its owned dry dock 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million 
this consisted primarily of dividends paid on common stock  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on march   the company declared a dividend of ten cents per share  payable on june   to shareholders of record as of june  based on the current number of outstanding shares  the impact of this dividend will be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was thousand 
this consisted primarily of a reduction in restricted cash and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the purchase of treasury stock 
credit facility in fiscal year  todd pacific shipyards corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  negotiated a million revolving credit facility with interest payable at the prime rate 
the credit facility  which is renewable on a bi annual basis  provides todd pacific with greater flexibility in funding its operational cash flow needs 
todd pacific had no outstanding borrowings as of march  and march   respectively 
commitments the company is subject to certain minimum operating lease payments on one of its dry docks that are charged to expense 
these operating leases contain renewal options and minimum annual maintenance requirements 
the minimum lease commitments are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
