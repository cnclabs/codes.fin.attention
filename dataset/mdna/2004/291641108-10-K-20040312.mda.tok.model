we currently supplement our on system generating capacity with purchases of capacity and energy from other utilities in order to meet the demands of our customers and the capacity margins applicable to us under current pooling agreements and national electric reliability council rules 
we have contracted with westar energy for the purchase of capacity and energy through may  we had short term contracts for the purchase of firm energy with american electric power aep from january through june the amount of capacity purchased under such contracts supplements our on system capacity and contributes to meeting our current expectations of future power needs 
to the extent we do not need such capacity to meet our customers needs  we can sell it in the wholesale market 
the following chart sets forth our purchase commitments and our anticipated owned capacity in megawatts during the indicated contract years which run from june to may of the following year 
we currently expect to purchase and install a megawatt simple cycle combustion turbine unit to be operational in to meet additional capacity requirements 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
contract year purchased power commitment anticipated owned capacity total the charges for capacity purchases under the westar contract referred to above during calendar year amounted to approximately million 
minimum charges for capacity purchases under the westar contract total approximately million for the period june   through may  the maximum hourly demand on our system reached a record high of  megawatts on august  our previous record peak of  megawatts was established in august the maximum hourly winter demand of megawatts was set on january  our previous winter peak of megawatts was established on december  construction program total gross property additions including construction work in progress for the three years ended december   amounted to million and retirements during the same period amounted to million 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information 
our total capital expenditures  including allowance for funds used during construction afudc  but excluding expenditures to retire assets  were million in and for the next three years are estimated for planning purposes to be as follows estimated capital expenditures amounts in millions total new generating facilities additions to existing generating facilities transmission facilities distribution system additions non regulated additions general and other additions total additions to our transmission and distribution systems to meet projected increases in customer demand and construction expenditures for the planned megawatt simple cycle ct constitute the majority of the projected capital expenditures for the three year period listed above 
estimated capital expenditures are reviewed and adjusted for  among other things  revised estimates of future capacity needs  the cost of funds necessary for construction and the availability and cost of alternative power 
actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates due to a number of factors including changes in equipment delivery schedules  changes in customer requirements  construction delays  ability to raise capital  environmental matters  the extent to which we receive timely and adequate rate increases  the extent of competition from independent power producers and co generators  other changes in business conditions and changes in legislation and regulation  including those relating to the energy industry

fuel coal supplied approximately of our total fuel requirements in based on kilowatt hours generated 
the remainder was supplied by natural gas with oil generation and tire derived fuel tdf  which is produced from discarded passenger car tires  providing the remaining 
we expect that the amount and percentage of electricity generated by natural gas will increase due to the addition of the two megawatt ft peaking units at the empire energy center in and the planned construction of an additional megawatt simple cycle combustion turbine unit at the energy center in our asbury plant is fueled primarily by coal with oil being used as start up fuel and tdf being used as a supplement fuel 
asbury is currently burning a coal blend consisting of approximately western coal powder river basin and blend coal on a tonnage basis 
our average coal inventory target at asbury is approximately days 
as of december   we had sufficient coal on hand to supply anticipated requirements at asbury for days 
our riverton plant fuel requirements are primarily met by coal with the remainder supplied by natural gas and oil 
riverton is currently burning western coal powder river basin on unit no 
and a blend consisting of approximately western coal powder river basin and blend coal on unit no 
on a tonnage basis 
our average coal inventory target at riverton is approximately days 
as of december   we had coal supplies on hand to meet anticipated requirements at the riverton plant for days 
this extra inventory was due to a longer than planned outage on unit no 
in we have a long term contract  expiring in december  with a subsidiary of peabody holding company  inc for the supply of low sulfur western coal powder river basin at the asbury and riverton plants during the term of the contract and expect to secure new contracts for western coal during this peabody coal is supplied from the rochelle north antelope mines located in campbell county  wyoming  and is shipped to the asbury plant by rail  a distance of approximately miles 
the coal is delivered under a transportation contract with union pacific railroad company and the kansas city southern railway company which expires in june we are currently leasing one car aluminum unit train  which delivers peabody coal to the asbury plant 
the peabody coal is transported from asbury to riverton via truck 
asbury blend coal was supplied during from coal purchased at the end of from genwal resources  inc and supplemented with coal supplied by phoenix coal sales  inc we entered into a long term contract expiring december  with phoenix coal sales  inc for a supply of blend coal from their new mine which will be opening in the asbury plant is receiving blend coal from another phoenix coal mine in the interim 
the riverton plant blend coal is currently being supplied under the same contract with phoenix coal sales  inc the phoenix coal is transported to riverton via truck 
unit no 
at the iatan plant is a coal fired generating unit which is jointly owned by kansas city power light kcp l  aquila and us 
kcp l is the operator of this plant and is responsible for arranging its fuel supply 
kcp l has secured contracts for low sulfur western coal in quantities sufficient to meet substantially all of iatan s requirements for and the coal is transported by rail under a contract expiring on december   with the burlington northern and santa fe railway company 
since  our energy center and state line combustion turbine facilities have been fueled primarily by natural gas with oil being used as a backup fuel 
in april  two megawatt ft peaking units were placed into commercial operation at the energy center 
during  fuel consumption at the energy center was natural gas with the remaining being oil on a btu basis 
state line fuel consumption during was natural gas 
our targeted oil inventory at the energy center facility permits eight days of full load operation on units no 
and we currently have oil inventories sufficient for approximately six days of full load operation for these two units at the energy center and five and one half days of full load operation for state line unit no 
the two new peaking units at the energy center are currently designed with a day tank for fuel oil storage  which allows both units to operate at full load for approximately one day 
we have firm transportation agreements with southern star central pipeline  inc with original expiration dates of july   for the transportation of natural gas to the state line power plant for the jointly owned combined cycle unit 
this date is adjusted for periods of contract suspension by us during outages of the slcc 
this transportation agreement can also supply natural gas to state line unit no 
 the energy center or the riverton plant  as elected by us on a secondary basis 
our transportation agreement was originally with williams natural gas company williams 
in  we signed a precedent agreement with williams  which upon completion of necessary upgrades to the natural gas pipeline system originally expected to be in june but now expected to be in june due to construction and permitting delays will grant us additional transportation capability through may  in  williams sold their central pipeline assets including our natural gas transportation agreements to southern star central pipeline  inc we expect that these transportation agreements will serve nearly all of our natural gas transportation needs over the next several years 
any remaining gas transportation requirements  although small  will be met by utilizing capacity release on other holder contracts  interruptible transport  or delivered to the plants by others 
the majority of our physical natural gas supply requirements will be met by short term forward contracts and spot market purchases 
forward natural gas commodity prices and volumes are hedged in accordance with our risk management policy in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and gain predictability

fuel adjustment clauses 
fuel adjustment clauses permit changes in fuel costs to be passed along to customers without the need for a rate proceeding 
automatic fuel adjustment clauses are presently applicable to retail electric sales in oklahoma and system wholesale kilowatt hour sales under ferc jurisdiction 
we have implemented an energy cost recovery rider in arkansas that adjusts for changing fuel and purchased power costs on an annual basis 
we do not have a fuel adjustment clause in kansas 
fuel adjustment clauses are not statutorily authorized in the state of missouri 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality as well as other environmental matters 
we believe that our operations are in compliance with present laws and regulations 
air 
the amendments to the clean air act  referred to as the amendments  affect the asbury  riverton  state line and iatan power plants and the new ft peaking units at the empire energy center 
the amendments require affected plants to meet certain emission standards  including maximum emission levels for sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxides nox 
when a plant becomes an affected unit for a particular emission  it locks in the then current emission standards 
the asbury plant became an affected unit under the amendments for so on january  and for nox as a group cyclone fired boiler on january  the iatan plant became an affected unit for both so and nox on january  the riverton plant became an affected unit for nox in november and for so on january  the state line plant became an affected unit for so and nox on january  the two new ft peaking units at the empire energy center became affected units for both so and nox in april so emissions 
under the amendments  the amount of so an affected unit can emit is regulated 
each existing affected unit has been awarded a specific number of emission allowances  each of which allows the holder to emit one ton of so utilities covered by the amendments must have emission allowances equal to the number of tons of so emitted during a given year by each of their affected units 
allowances may be traded between plants or utilities or banked for future use 
a market for the trading of emission allowances exists on the chicago board of trade 
the environmental protection agency epa withholds annually a percentage of the emission allowances awarded to each affected unit and sells those emission allowances through a direct auction 
we receive compensation from the epa for the sale of these allowances 
our asbury  riverton and iatan plants currently burn a blend of low sulfur western coal powder river basin and higher sulfur local coal or burn low sulfur western coal 
the state line plant and the energy center s new ft peaking units are gas fired facilities and do not receive so allowances 
however  annual allowance requirements for the state line plant and the new ft peaking units  which are not expected to exceed allowances per year  will be transferred from our inventoried bank of allowances 
we anticipate  based on current operations  that the combined actual so allowance need for all affected plant facilities will not exceed the number of allowances awarded to us annually by the epa 
the excess annual so allowances will be transferred to our inventoried bank of allowances 
we currently have  banked allowances 
nox emissions 
the asbury  iatan  state line  energy center and riverton plants are each in compliance with the nox limits applicable to them under the amendments as currently operated 
the asbury plant received permission from the missouri department of natural resources mdnr to burn tire derived fuel at a maximum rate of of total fuel input 
during  approximately  tons of tdf were burned 
this is equivalent to  discarded passenger car tires 
in april the mdnr promulgated a final rule addressing the ozone moderate non attainment classification of the st 
louis area 
the final regulation  known as the missouri nox rule  set a maximum nox emission rate of lbs mmbtu for eastern missouri and a maximum nox emission rate of lbs mmbtu for western missouri 
the iatan  asbury  state line and energy center facilities are affected by the western missouri regulation 
in april the mdnr approved amendments to the missouri nox rule 
included were amendments to delay the effective date of the rule until may  and to establish a nox emission limit of lbs mmbtu for plants burning tire derived fuel with a minimum annual burn of  passenger tire equivalents 
the asbury plant qualified for the lbs mmbtu emission rate 
all of our plants currently meet the required emission limits and additional nox controls are not required 
water 
we operate under the kansas and missouri water pollution plans that were implemented in response to the federal water pollution control act amendments of the asbury  iatan  riverton  energy center and state line facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations and have received discharge permits and subsequent renewals as required 
the riverton and state line power plants national pollution discharge elimination system permits were issued in other 
under title v of the amendments  we must obtain site operating permits for each of our plants from the authorities in the state in which the plant is located 
these permits  which are valid for five years  regulate the plant site s total emissions  including emissions from stacks  individual pieces of equipment  road dust  coal dust and other emissions 
we have been issued permits for asbury  iatan  riverton  state line and the energy center power plants 
in mid december  the epa issued proposed regulations with respect to so  nox and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants in a proposed rulemaking known as the interstate air quality rule 
also in mid december  the epa issued proposed regulations for mercury under the requirements of the amendments 
both sets of proposed rules are currently under a public review and comment period and may change before being issued as final regulations in or early it is possible that some expenditures may need to begin as early as in order to meet a proposed december  requirement for mercury reduction in the amendments version of the proposed mercury regulations 
the proposed interstate air quality rule would require significant additional reductions in emissions from our power plants  in phases  beginning in preliminary estimates of capital costs to meet these requirements cannot be made at this time due to the uncertainty surrounding the final regulations  but could possibly be significant 
conditions respecting financing our indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  dated as of september   as amended and supplemented the mortgage  and our restated articles of incorporation restated articles  specify earnings coverage and other conditions which must be complied with in connection with the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or cumulative preferred stock  or the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness 
the mortgage contains a requirement that for new first mortgage bonds to be issued  our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any twelve consecutive months within the months preceding issuance must be two times the annual interest requirements as defined in the mortgage on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and on the prospective issue of new first mortgage bonds 
our earnings for the twelve months ended december   would permit us to issue approximately million of new first mortgage bonds based on this test at an assumed interest rate of  subject to approval of the missouri public service commission to mortgage property 
the mortgage provides an exception from this earnings requirement in certain instances relating to the issuance of new first mortgage bonds against first mortgage bonds which have been  or are to be  retired 
in addition to the interest coverage requirement  the mortgage provides that new bonds must be issued against  among other things  retired bonds or of net property additions 
at december   we had retired bonds and net property additions which would enable the issuance of at least million principal amount of bonds if the annual interest requirements are met 
under the restated articles  a cumulative preferred stock may be issued only if our net income available for interest and dividends as defined in the restated articles for a specified twelve month period is at least times the sum of the annual interest requirements on all indebtedness and the annual dividend requirements on all cumulative preferred stock to be outstanding immediately after the issuance of such additional shares of cumulative preferred stock  and b so long as any preferred stock is outstanding  the amount of unsecured indebtedness outstanding may not exceed of the sum of the outstanding secured indebtedness plus our capital and surplus 
we have no outstanding preferred stock 
accordingly  the restriction in our restated articles does not currently restrict the amount of unsecured indebtedness that we may have outstanding

we also provide water service to three towns in missouri and have investments in several non regulated businesses including fiber optics  internet access  utility industry technical training  close tolerance custom manufacturing and customer information system software services through our wholly owned subsidiary  ede holdings  inc the primary drivers of our electric operating revenues in any period are weather  rates we can charge our customers  customer growth and general economic conditions 
weather affects the demand for electricity for our regulated business 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand  while mild weather reduces demand 
residential and commercial sales are impacted more by weather than industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity 
the utility commissions in the states in which we operate  as well as the ferc  set the rates at which we can charge our customers 
in order to offset expenses  we depend on our ability to receive adequate and timely rate relief 
we continue to assess the need for rate relief in all of the jurisdictions we serve and file for such relief when necessary 
customer growth contributes to the demand for electricity 
we expect our annual customer growth to be approximately over the next several years 
general economic conditions primarily affect our industrial sales 
we experienced better economic conditions in as compared to  when our service territory experienced a general slowdown in economic activity 
the primary drivers of our electric operating expenses in any period are fuel and purchased power expense  maintenance and repairs expense  employee pension and health care costs  taxes and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense 
fuel and purchased power costs are our largest expense items 
several factors affect these costs  including fuel and purchased power prices  plant outages and weather  which drives customer demand 
in order to control the price we pay for fuel and purchased power  we have entered into long and short term agreements to purchase coal and natural gas for our energy supply and currently engage in hedging activities in an effort to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices 
we enter into contracts with counterparties relating to our future natural gas requirements that lock in prices with respect to predetermined percentages of our expected future natural gas needs in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and improve predictability 
during we improved our financial strength through rate increases that contributed to our increase in earnings per share to in as compared to in and by taking advantage of lower interest rates to refinance long term debt  which allowed us to lower our cost of debt as well as our level of short term debt 
our results were significantly impacted by the following items 
the increase in earnings in was primarily due to the december missouri rate increase  may ferc rate increase and august oklahoma rate increase 
also favorably impacting earnings was a million decrease in maintenance and repairs expense  the absence of million in terminated merger expenses as compared to and continued customer growth 
earnings per share for were negatively impacted by a million net increase in pension expense  a million decrease in the net impact revenues less expenses of off system sales and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
the calculation of our earnings per share for also gives effect to the sale in underwritten public offerings of million shares of our common stock in december and million shares in may see liquidity and capital resources below 
basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in the following pre tax items positively affected earnings per share increased revenue from the october and december missouri rate increases  the july kansas rate increase  lower fuel and purchased power prices  an increase in off system sales and decreased depreciation expense pursuant to the missouri rate order noted above 
also favorably impacting earnings were cooler temperatures in april and the fourth quarter and warmer temperatures in june and september as compared to the same periods in and a million unrealized gain on derivatives in december earnings per share for were negatively impacted by million in terminated merger expenses as well as planned increased maintenance costs for our combustion turbine and combined cycle units 
earnings per share for were negatively impacted by the mild weather in the third and fourth quarters  increased natural gas prices and greater use of gas than in the prior year and a one time non cash charge of million  net of related income taxes  from the write down of the slcc construction expenditures 
earnings for included approximately million  after taxes  resulting from the tax benefit occurring because we recognized approximately million of merger related expenses upon the termination of the proposed merger with aquila  inc in january the calculation of our earnings per share for also gives effect to the sale in underwritten public offerings of million shares of our common stock in december and million shares in may see liquidity and capital resources below 
restatements we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of as a result of a determination we made in january that an adjustment was necessary to the estimated pension cost that had been recorded throughout related to the defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
this adjustment was based on corrected actuarial information received relative to minimum actuarial loss amortization requirements under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result of this adjustment  we recorded million as additional pre tax pension expense for million  net of tax  or per share 
the restatement reduced previously reported earnings by  and per share for the quarters ended march   june  and september   respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item results of operations the following discussion analyzes significant changes in the results of operations for  compared to  and for  compared to electric operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales electric operating revenues comprised approximately of our total operating revenues during of these total electric operating revenues  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers  from wholesale off system transactions and from miscellaneous sources  primarily transmission services 
the breakdown of our customer classes has not significantly changed from or the amounts and percentage changes from the prior periods in kilowatt hour kwh sales and operating revenues by major customer class for on system electric sales were as follows kwh sales in millions change change residential commercial industrial wholesale on system other total on system operating revenues in millions change change residential commercial industrial wholesale on system other total on system percentage changes are based on actual kwhs and revenues and may not agree to the rounded amounts shown in this table 
revenues exclude amounts collected under the interim energy charge during and and refunded to customers during the first quarter of see discussion below 
other kwh sales and other operating revenues include street lighting  other public authorities and interdepartmental usage 
on system electric transactions kwh sales for our on system customers increased slightly during primarily due to customer growth 
colder temperatures during the first quarter of as compared to milder temperatures during the same period in had a positive effect on sales with a new all time winter peak of megawatts being established on january   replacing the previous winter peak of megawatts established in december however  the increase in first quarter sales was offset by unfavorable weather in the second  third and fourth quarters of notwithstanding setting a new summer peak demand of  megawatts on august  despite only a slight increase in kwh sales  revenues for our on system customers increased approximately million  with approximately million of this increase attributed to the missouri  oklahoma and ferc rate increases discussed below with the remainder attributed to customer growth 
customer growth contributed approximately million to revenues during offset by an approximate million negative effect from weather 
our customer growth was in  in and in we expect our annual customer growth to be approximately over the next several years 
notwithstanding the new summer peak demand  the slight increases in residential and commercial kwh sales in were due primarily to the customer growth discussed above 
industrial sales and revenues  which are not particularly weather sensitive  increased during mainly due to increased sales resulting from the addition of two new oil pipeline pumping stations on our system that became fully operational in june also contributing to the increase were increased sales during the first quarter of because of better economic conditions as compared to the first quarter of when our service territory experienced a general slowdown in economic activity 
in addition  industrial revenues  as well as residential and commercial revenues  were favorably impacted by the december missouri rate increase and  to a lesser extent  the august oklahoma rate increase 
on system wholesale kwh sales decreased due mainly to the change in customer status in june of an on system wholesale customer aggregator  which comprised three of our on system wholesale accounts  which elected to go off system and purchase power from us at market based rates 
revenues received from these accounts  which comprised of our on system wholesale sales  but less than one half percent of our total on system sales  in both and  are now included in our off system sales 
this reclassification did not have a material impact on off system sales 
overall revenues associated with these ferc regulated sales increased as a result of the ferc rate increase that became effective may  and as a result of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such sales 
this clause permits the pass through to customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
kwh sales for our on system customers increased during as compared to  primarily due to cooler temperatures in april and the fourth quarter of during our heating seasons and warmer temperatures in june and september during our air conditioning season 
revenues for our on system customers increased primarily as a result of the increased sales and the october missouri rate increase and  to a lesser extent  the december missouri rate increase and the july kansas rate increase discussed below 
the increases in residential and commercial kwh sales and revenues in were due primarily to the weather conditions and rate increases discussed above 
industrial sales and revenues increased  reflecting increased sales in april and during august through november as compared to the same periods in residential  commercial and industrial revenues for were also favorably impacted by the missouri and kansas rate increases 
on system wholesale kwh sales increased in  reflecting the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these sales decreased in as compared to as a result of the operation of our fuel adjustment clause applicable to these ferc regulated sales 
rate matters the following table sets forth information regarding electric and water rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above jurisdiction date requested annual increase granted percent increase granted date effective missouri electric november  october  missouri electric march  december  missouri water may  december  kansas electric december  july  ferc electric march  may  oklahoma electric march  august  the missouri order approved an annual interim energy charge  or iec  of approximately million effective october  and expiring two years later which was collected subject to refund with interest 
the missouri electric order called for us to refund all funds collected under the iec  with interest  by march  the refunds were made in the first quarter of and did not have a material impact on our earnings in any of the years from through on march   we filed a request with the oklahoma corporation commission for an annual increase in base rates for our oklahoma electric customers in the amount of  or 
on august  a unanimous stipulation and agreement was approved by the oklahoma corporation commission providing an annual increase in rates for our oklahoma customers of approximately  or  effective for bills rendered on or after august  this reflects a rate of return on equity of 
on march   we filed a request with the ferc for an annual increase in base rates for our on system wholesale electric customers in the amount of  or 
this increase was approved by the ferc on april  with the new rates becoming effective may  we will continue to assess the need for rate relief in all of the jurisdictions we serve and file for such relief when necessary 
off system electric transactions in addition to sales to our own customers  we sell power to other utilities as available and provide transmission service through our system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
the following table sets forth information regarding these sales and related expenses of off system wholesale and transmission services in millions revenues expenses net the decrease in revenues less expenses in resulted primarily from the non renewal of short term contracts for firm energy that ran from january through june we sold this energy in the wholesale market when it was not required to meet our own customers needs during that period 
the increase in revenues during resulted primarily from the availability of competitively priced power from our slcc which was placed in service in june and the term purchases of firm energy during which  when not required to meet our own customers needs  could be sold in the wholesale market 
see competition below 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to total fuel costs increased approximately million during offset by a decrease in purchased power costs of approximately million making total combined fuel and purchased power costs in virtually the same as in the increase in total fuel costs reflects a million payment in the fourth quarter of  expensed as additional fuel costs in the third quarter of  pursuant to a settlement with enron of a fuel contract dispute  a million unfavorable coal inventory adjustment in august and increased generation by our coal fired units  reflecting the non renewal of short term contracts for firm energy that ran from january through june despite the effectiveness of our natural gas procurement program  increased natural gas prices during led to a increase in our average cost of gas as compared to the decrease in purchased power costs primarily reflects a shift from serving our energy needs with purchased power to generating our own power  reflecting that it was more economical to run our own generating units during the third and fourth quarters of than to purchase power 
this decrease in purchased power costs also reflects the decrease in off system sales due to the non renewal of the short term contracts for firm energy discussed above 
regulated other operating expenses increased approximately million during as compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in employee pension expense due primarily to a decline in the value of invested funds 
based on the performance of our pension plan assets through december   we expect to be required under erisa to fund approximately million in and million in in order to maintain minimum funding levels 
no minimum pension liability was required to be recorded as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item for further discussion of the accounting for our pension plans 
expenses relating to our employee health care plan contributed million to the increase in regulated other operating expenses while increases in insurance premiums added million 
we expect pension and health care costs to continue to increase 
non regulated operating expense for all periods presented is discussed below under non regulated items 
there were no expenses during relating to the terminated merger with aquila  inc  as compared to million during expenses related to the terminated merger in were primarily the result of expenses related to severance benefits incurred under our change in control severance pay plan in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item for more information on the terminated merger 
maintenance and repairs expense decreased approximately million during as compared to maintenance and repairs expense for the state line and energy center units decreased approximately million partially offset by an approximate million increase in maintenance and repairs at our riverton plant reflecting a scheduled five year maintenance outage for unit no 
in the first and second quarters of as well as to make necessary repairs to a high pressure cylinder 
the decrease in maintenance and repairs expense for the state line combined cycle unit reflects  in part  a million true up credit received from siemens westinghouse in june related to our maintenance contract entered into in july for the state line combined cycle unit as well as estimated monthly credits we have been accruing since july monthly payments on this contract had been based on an assumption of equivalent starts per unit each year 
actual starts during the twelve month period ended june   however  were significantly less than originally estimated resulting in the june true up credit 
we are now expensing maintenance costs and accruing a credit based on actual monthly usage hours for the contract year ending june  as of december   we have accrued million in estimated credits 
a million payment during the third quarter of  per contract terms  to westar generating  inc wgi for maintenance expense related to our usage of the existing unit no 
turbine prior to wgi s joint ownership of the state line combined cycle unit also contributed to the decreased maintenance expense in lower payments during the first half of on our long term operating plant maintenance contracts for outage services on units no 
and no 
at the energy center and state line unit no 
as compared to the first half of when we were making additional payments of approximately million also contributed to the decrease 
lastly  renegotiated terms for the energy center units and state line unit no 
contract for outage services reduced maintenance costs during by million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during due to increased plant in service 
total provision for income taxes increased approximately million during due primarily to higher taxable income 
our effective federal and state income tax rate for the twelve months ended december  was as compared to for the twelve months ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to total purchased power costs increased by approximately million during although the amount of power purchased increased  reflecting increased demand in the second and third quarters of and the term purchases of firm energy previously discussed 
purchased power costs reflected lower purchased power prices in than in total fuel costs decreased approximately million during as compared to  resulting in a net decrease in fuel and purchased power costs of million 
the million decrease in total fuel costs primarily reflected lower natural gas prices in as well as less generation by our gas fired units due in large part to the term purchases of firm energy 
natural gas costs on a per mmbtu basis were lower by during than in this was a result of a combination of lower commodity prices during and our natural gas procurement program 
regulated other operating expenses increased approximately million during primarily due to increases of million in administrative and general expense resulting from increased expense for employee health care and benefit plans and decreased pension income  million in transmission expense for the delivery of purchased energy to our system and million in other power operation expenses related to a full year of operation of the slcc 
expenses relating to the terminated merger with aquila  inc  were million during as compared to million in expenses related to the terminated merger in both and were primarily the result of expenses related to severance benefits incurred under our change in control severance pay plan in the first quarters of those years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item for more information on the terminated merger 
maintenance and repairs expense increased approximately million during expenditures under long term maintenance contracts that serve to levelize maintenance costs over time and are reflected in our rates that became effective in october  accounted for million of this increase of which million was for the maintenance contracts that began in january for the energy center and state line unit no 
and million was for the first full year of these contracts for the slcc  which commenced operations in june maintenance costs associated with a three week outage to replace the main transformer at the asbury plant during the second quarter of also contributed to this increase 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million during due to lower depreciation rates put into effect during the fourth quarter of as a result of the october missouri rate order 
total provision for income taxes increased approximately million during due primarily to higher taxable income and the benefit created by the deductibility of approximately million in merger related expenses in the first quarter of as a result of the termination of the proposed merger with aquila  inc in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes increased approximately million during as compared to primarily due to a reduction in capitalized property taxes related to the slcc being placed in service in june non regulated items we began investing in non regulated businesses in and now lease capacity on our fiber optics network  provide internet access  offer utility industry technical training  perform close tolerance custom manufacturing mid america precision products  llc mapp and license customer information system software services through our wholly owned subsidiary  ede holdings  inc in december  we sold our monitored security business  e watch  to federal protection  inc of springfield  missouri after it did not meet our earnings expectations 
this sale did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on february  we purchased joplin 
com  a leading internet service provider in the joplin  missouri area 
the purchase was made through transaeris  a non regulated subsidiary of ede holdings  inc we merged transaeris and joplin 
com into one company named fast freedom  inc in september   ede holdings  inc 
purchased an approximate interest in etg  a company that makes automated meter reading equipment 
see item  business general for further information about these non regulated businesses 
during  total non regulated operating revenue increased approximately million while total non regulated operating expense increased approximately million as compared with the significant increases during were primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of mapp operating revenues and expenses as compared to the prior year results which reflected the acquisition of mapp in july the increase in expenses was also due to the activities of conversant  inc  a software company which began business in early conversant markets customer watch  the internet based customer information system software formerly named centurion that was developed by our employees 
in june  conversant  inc signed a contract with intermountain gas company of boise  idaho 
a pilot project has been successfully completed and conversant  inc began contributing license revenues in the fourth quarter of full implementation is scheduled to be complete by midyear our non regulated businesses generated a million net loss in as compared to a million net loss in the decreased loss was primarily due to the increased profitability of mapp partially offsetting the net loss of conversant 
during  total non regulated operating revenue increased approximately million while total non regulated operating expense increased approximately million compared with the increase in both revenues and expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of mapp in july the increase in expense was also due to the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary  conversant  inc in  we began recording revenue from our non regulated business in non regulated under operating revenues and including expense from such business in non regulated under the operating revenue deductions section of our income statements rather than netting them under other net in the other income and deductions section  as we had done in prior periods 
we have reclassified the non regulated revenues and expenses for prior periods to conform to the new presentations 
prior period amounts reclassified are not material to the results of operations for those periods 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc decreased million in and million in reflecting the completion of the slcc in june see note of notes to financial statements under item a one time write down of million was taken in the third quarter of for disallowed capital costs related to the construction of the slcc 
these costs were disallowed as part of a stipulated agreement approved by the missouri commission in connection with our rate case and will not be recovered in rates 
the net effect on earnings after considering the tax effect on this write down was million 
total interest charges on long term debt increased million in as compared to primarily reflecting the effects of the sale of million of senior notes on december   the sale of million of senior notes on june  and the redemption of all million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series due on june  our sale of million of senior notes for net proceeds of approximately million on november  and subsequent redemption of three separate series of higher interest first mortgage bonds aggregating approximately million also decreased interest charges slightly 
see liquidity and capital resources for further information 
total interest charges on long term debt decreased million in as compared to mainly due to the maturing of million of our first mortgage bonds in july other comprehensive income the change in the fair value of our open gas contracts and our interest rate derivative contracts and the gains and losses on contracts settled during the periods being reported  including the tax effect of these items  are included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income as the net change in unrealized gain or loss 
this net change is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in the capitalization section of our balance sheet and does not affect earnings per share 
all of these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains and losses accumulated in comprehensive income are reclassified to fuel  or interest expense  as applicable  in the periods in which they are actually realized or no longer qualify for hedge accounting 
we had a net change in unrealized gain of million at the end of as compared to a net change in unrealized gain of million at the end of and a net change in unrealized loss of million at the end of  the first year we recorded such contracts 
we had entered into an interest rate derivative contract in may to hedge against the risk of a rise in interest rates impacting our senior notes due prior to their issuance on june  costs associated with the interest rate derivative primarily due to interest rate fluctuations amounted to approximately million and have been capitalized as a regulatory asset and will be amortized over the life of the notes  along with the million redemption premium paid on the redemption of the million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due the million year interest rate derivative contract that we had entered into on may  expired on october  with a gain of million 
this amount was recorded as a regulatory liability and will be amortized against interest expense over the year life of the debt issue we had hedged 
see note long term debt under notes to consolidated financial statements under item we had no interest rate derivative contracts in or during we settled fuel derivative contracts for losses of million 
natural gas prices increased throughout the year resulting in the fair market value fmv of our open contracts increasing by million 
we adjust our other comprehensive income oci to net of taxes for the gains and losses on our open contracts 
the increase in the fmv of our contracts in resulted in an approximate million tax effect 
the combined effect of these items resulted in an increase in oci of million  net of taxes  in during we settled contracts for gains of million  including a million gain on interest rate derivatives 
natural gas prices continued to increase in resulting in the fmv of our open contracts increasing by million 
the adjustment to oci for taxes in was million 
the combined effect of these items resulted in an increase in oci of million  net of taxes  in competition federal regulation has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the wholesale electric utility industry 
however  none of the states in our service territory has legislation that could require competitive retail pricing to be put into effect 
the arkansas legislature passed a bill in april that called for deregulation of the state s electricity industry as early as january however  a law was passed in february repealing deregulation in the state of arkansas 
we  and most other electric utilities with interstate transmission facilities  have placed our facilities under ferc regulated open access tariffs that provide all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the opportunity to procure transmission services at the same rates that the utilities provide themselves 
we are a member of the southwest power pool spp  a regional reliability coordinator of the north american electric reliability council 
effective september   we began taking network integration transmission service under the spp s open access transmission tariff 
this provides a cost effective way for us to participate in a broader market of generation resources with the possibility of lower transmission costs 
this tariff provides for a zonal rate structure  whereby transmission customers pay a pro rata share  in the form of a reservation charge  for the use of the facilities for each transmission owner that serves them 
currently  all revenues collected within a zone are allocated back to the transmission owner serving the zone 
to the extent that we are allocated revenues and charges to serve our on system wholesale and retail power customers  only the difference  if any  is recorded 
revenues received from off system transmission customers are reflected in electric operating revenues and the related charges expensed 
prior to the time we began taking network integration transmission service under the spp s open access transmission tariff  we had an agreement with kansas city power light kcp l for transmission service from the iatan plant 
we believed we had the right to terminate the service under the older iatan transmission agreement  whereas kcp l contended that we did not 
while we were working to resolve this dispute  we ceased scheduling service from kcp l but continued to accrue but not pay the monthly amount we had paid under the original contract terms 
we reached a settlement with kcp l to pay approximately million which was the amount that had accrued since october and was paid in august  and to continue the service agreement with kcp l through march  at which time we will be released from the original agreement 
the additional cost for continuing the service agreement through march is approximately million payable in monthly installments 
in december  the ferc issued order no 
which encourages the development of regional transmission organizations rtos 
rtos are designed to independently control the wholesale transmission services of the utilities in their regions thereby facilitating open and more competitive bulk power markets 
the spp and midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso agreed in october to consolidate and form an rto which was approved by the ferc in december however  on march   the spp and miso announced they had mutually agreed to terminate the consolidation of the organizations 
on october   the spp announced it had filed with the ferc seeking formal recognition as an rto in accordance with ferc order on february  the ferc approved the spp rto with conditions that include implementing its independent board and modifying its governance structure  expanding the coverage of spp s tariff to assure that it is the sole transmission provider  obtaining clear and sufficient authority to exercise day to day operational control over appropriate transmission facilities  having an independent market monitor in place  obtaining clear and precise authority to independently and solely determine which project to include in the regional transmission plan and having a seams agreement with miso on file 
upon completion of the conditions  the spp would gain status and ferc acceptance as an rto 
on october  we filed a notice of intent with the spp for the right to withdraw from the spp effective october  because of uncertainty surrounding the treatment from the states regarding rto participation and cost recovery  increased risk of additional membership assessment cost allocation due to potential member departures  and anticipated change in the terms and conditions of the spp tariff and network services 
such withdrawal requires approval from the ferc 
we retain the option  however  to rescind such notice on or before october  and remain a member of the spp 
kansas city power and light  southwestern power administration  westar energy  inc  southwestern public service  grand river dam authority and american electric power have also filed notices of intent to withdraw 
we are unable to quantify the potential impact of membership in an rto on our future financial position  results of operation or cash flows at this time  but will continue to evaluate the situation and make a decision whether or not to continue membership with the spp prior to the october  withdrawal notice deadline 
on november   ferc issued its final rule  order  regarding electric and natural gas industry code of conduct requirements for transmission service providers 
order is closely related to order standards of conduct for electric transmission providers and management of open access same time information systems oasis for the power industry 
on february   we made an informational filing to ferc in response to order describing our existing waiver  issued in may  of order requirements and requesting the continuation of such waiver for order requirements 
if in the future  ferc determines that a waiver of orders and is not appropriate for us  then we will be required to separate our bulk power retail sales and purchase functions from our transmission operations functions as well as implement formal code of conduct training and oasis practices 
as a small utility that does not influence our regional wholesale power market  the benefits of modifying our organization and implementing systems and processes to promote a more efficient and competitive wholesale market do not  in our opinion  appear to exceed the estimated start up costs of between million and million plus annual recurring costs 
ferc s decision is pending as to whether or not our and the other existing order waivers within the industry will be continued and  if not  when compliance plans would need be implemented and associated costs incurred 
approximately of our electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring wheeling  or the use  for a fee  of transmission facilities owned by one company or system to move electrical power for another company or system 
our two largest on system wholesale customers accounted for of our wholesale business in we have contracts with these customers that run through the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities our net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million during as compared to primarily due to the refunding of million to our missouri electric customers  which was the amount of the iec with interest collected between october and december we had collected million of the iec  subject to refund  during this outflow of cash in was partially offset by a million increase in net income  a million increase due to changes in accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues and a million increase in depreciation and amortization due to increased plant in service during also positively impacting cash flows provided by operating activities were a deferred income tax increase of million during as compared to primarily due to deferred taxes related to an additional first year depreciation tax allowance recorded for financial statement purposes primarily for our ft peaking units and the deduction for tax purposes of the loss on reacquired debt unamortized issuance costs and discounts on the redeemed first mortgage bonds and a change from pension income of million in to pension expense of million in primarily due to a decline in the value of invested funds 
negatively impacting cash provided by operating activities were decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to the completion of payments on our ft peaking units 
our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased million during as compared to primarily due to an increase in net income of million as well as the collection of million of the iec as compared to million collected in from our missouri electric customers 
an million increase in deferred taxes also contributed to the increased cash flow 
capital requirements and investing activities our net cash flows used in investing activities decreased million during as compared to  primarily reflecting the completion of the two ft peaking units at the empire energy center in april our net cash flows used in investing activities decreased million during as compared to  primarily reflecting decreased construction expenditures due mainly to the completion of the slcc in june our capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  as used in this section  include afudc 
capital expenditures to retire assets are not included here  but are included in capital expenditures on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
a breakdown of these capital expenditures for  and is as follows capital expenditures in millions distribution and transmission system additions ft peaking units energy center state line combined cycle unit may tornado damage additions and replacements asbury additions and replacements riverton  iatan and ozark beach system mapping project fiber optics non regulated other non regulated capital expenditures computer services projects combustor system upgrade state line other total the amounts in the table for do not include million of capitalized spare parts for the state line combined cycle plant  million of plant retirements and million in capital leases and utility land transferred to land held for future use 
approximately  and of the cash requirements for capital expenditures for  and  respectively  were satisfied internally from operations with funds provided by operating activities less dividends paid 
the remaining amounts of such requirements were satisfied from short term borrowings and proceeds from our sales of common stock and unsecured senior notes discussed below 
we had estimated that our capital expenditures would total approximately million in capital expenditures were higher than expected in  primarily as a result of the may tornado damage and customer growth 
on july  our subsidiary  ede holdings  inc  together with other investors  acquired the assets of the precision products department of eagle picher technologies  llc 
the acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a newly formed limited liability company  mid america precision products  llc mapp 
ede holdings  inc acquired a controlling percent interest in mapp through a cash investment of million and  as of december  was the guarantor for of a million long term note payable and a million revolving short term credit facility 
although our ownership interest in mapp remains at  as of january   our guaranty was lowered to 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  we anticipate that we will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to our distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
these capital expenditure estimates also include approximately million in and million in for the purchase and installation of a megawatt simple cycle ct unit which is scheduled to be operational in as a result of an unexpected event on january  when one of our original combustion turbine peaking units  energy center unit no 
 experienced a rotating blade failure  our estimated capital expenditures could increase 
upon dismantling and inspecting the unit  we found damage to rotating and stationary components in the turbine as well as anomalies in the generator 
because of the new capacity added in  we do not expect the problem to materially impact fuel or purchased power costs 
we expect our share of the expenses related to the damage to be approximately million  including million to meet our insurance deductible 
we estimate that internally generated funds will provide of the funds required in for capital expenditures 
as in the past  we intend to utilize short term debt or the proceeds of sales of long term debt or common stock including common stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan  our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  and our k plan and esop to finance any additional amounts needed for such capital expenditures 
we will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements 
the estimates herein may be changed because of changes we make in our construction program  unforeseen construction costs  our ability to obtain financing  regulation and for other reasons 
financing activities our net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased million during as compared to and decreased million during as compared to our net cash flows provided by financing activities were primarily affected by issuances of common stock  senior notes and trust preferred securities and redemptions and repayments of senior notes and first mortgage bonds  each of which is described in detail below 
also increasing net cash flows provided by financing activities for was the receipt of million from a realized gain resulting from an interest rate derivative  which was partially offset by a loss of million on a similar interest rate derivative 
on march   the empire district electric trust i issued two million shares of its trust preferred securities in a public underwritten offering 
this sale generated proceeds of million and issuance costs of million 
holders of the trust preferred securities are entitled to receive distributions at an annual rate of of the per share liquidation amount 
quarterly payments of dividends by the trust  as well as payments of principal  are made from cash received from corresponding payments made by us on million aggregate principal amount of our junior subordinated debentures due march   issued by us to the trust  and held by the trust as assets 
our interest payments on the debentures are tax deductible by us

we have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec under which approximately million of our common stock  unsecured debt securities  preference stock and  subject to the approval of the missouri public service commission to mortgage property  first mortgage bonds remain available for issuance 
on april   we closed a two year renewal of our million unsecured revolving credit facility which was to expire on may  borrowings are at the bank s prime commercial rate or libor plus basis points based on our current credit ratings and the pricing schedule in the line of credit facility 
the credit facility is used for working capital  general corporate purposes and to back up our use of commercial paper 
this facility requires our total indebtedness which does not include the trust preferred securities to be less than of our total capitalization at the end of each fiscal quarter and our ebitda defined as net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other non cash charges to be at least two times our interest charges which includes distributions on the trust preferred securities for the trailing four fiscal quarters at the end of each fiscal quarter 
failure to maintain these ratios would result in an event of default under the credit facility and would prohibit us from borrowing funds thereunder 
we are in compliance with these ratios as of december  this credit facility is also subject to cross default if we default in excess of  in the aggregate on our other indebtedness 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolver as of december  however  million of the facility as of that date was used to back up our commercial paper and was not available to be borrowed 
restrictions in our mortgage bond indenture could affect our liquidity 
the mortgage contains a requirement that for new first mortgage bonds to be issued  our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any twelve consecutive months within the fifteen months preceding issuance must be two times the annual interest requirements as defined in the mortgage on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and on the prospective issue of new first mortgage bonds 
our earnings for the twelve months ended december  would permit us to issue approximately million of new first mortgage bonds based on this test with an assumed interest rate of  subject to approval of the missouri public service commission to mortgage property 
the mortgage provides an exception from this earnings requirement in certain instances  relating to the issuance of new first mortgage bonds against first mortgage bonds which have been  or are to be  retired 
see note to notes to financial statements for more information on the mortgage bond indenture 
as of december   the ratings for our securities were as follows moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds baa bbb first mortgage bonds pollution control series aaa aaa senior notes baa bbb commercial paper p a trust preferred securities baa bb moody s and standard poor s currently have a negative outlook and a stable outlook  respectively  on empire 
these ratings indicate the agencies assessment of our ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends and principal on these securities 
the lower the rating the higher the cost of the securities when they are sold 
ratings below investment grade baa or above for moody s and bbb or above for standard poor s may also impair our ability to issue short term debt as described above  commercial paper or other securities or make the marketing of such securities more difficult 
contractual obligations set forth below is information summarizing our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt w o discount trust preferred securities capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension funding obligations open purchase orders other long term liabilities total contractual obligations includes fuel and purchased power contracts and associated transportation costs 
other long term liabilities primarily represents of the long term debt issued by mid america precision products  llc 
ede holdings  inc  as of december   was the guarantor of a million note included in this total amount 
the pension funding obligations disclosed in the above table represent our estimated funding obligations in for the year ending  and for the year ending off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies set forth below are certain accounting policies that are considered by management to be critical and to possibly involve significant risk  which means that they typically require difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain other accounting policies may also require assumptions that could cause actual results to be different than anticipated results 
a change in assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters  among others  could have a material impact on future financial results 
pensions 
our pension expense or benefit includes amortization of previously unrecognized net gains or losses 
the amortized amount represents the average of gains and losses over the prior five years  with this amount being amortized over five years 
in compliance with fas  additional gain or expense may be recognized when our unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of our pension benefit obligation or fair value of plan assets 
in addition  we record a liability when the accumulated benefit obligation of the plan exceeds the fair value of the plan assets 
our policy is consistent with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
in our most recent missouri rate case  the commission ruled that we would be allowed to recover pension costs on an erisa minimum funding or cash basis 
previously  the commission allowed us to recover pension costs consistent with our gaap policy noted above 
we have determined that the difference between the recovery allowed by the commission and our accounting for pension costs under gaap does not meet the fas requirements for regulatory deferral 
as a result  we will continue to account for pension expense or benefits in accordance with sfas  using the previously mentioned amortization formula for recognizing net gains or losses 
as a result  future pension expense or benefits may not be fully recovered or recognized in rates charged to customers 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include future rate of return on plan assets  interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations and discount rates 
based on the performance of our pension plan assets through december   we expect to be required under erisa to fund approximately million in and million in in order to maintain minimum funding levels 
these amounts are estimates and may change based on actual investment performance  any future pension plan funding and finalization of actuarial assumptions 
absent a continued recovery in the equity markets  pension expense and cash funding requirements could substantially increase over the next several years 
no minimum pension liability was required to be recorded as of december  postretirement benefits 
we recognize expense related to postretirement benefits as earned during the employee s period of service 
related assets and liabilities are established based upon the funded status of the plan compared to the accumulated benefit obligation 
our postretirement expense or benefit includes amortization of previously unrecognized net gains or losses 
the amortized amount represents the average of gains and losses over the prior five years  with this amount being amortized over five years 
additional gain or expense may be recognized when our unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of our postretirement benefit obligation or fair value of plan assets 
our policy is consistent with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include future rate of return on plan assets  interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations  healthcare cost trend rates and discount rates as well as medicare prescription drug costs 
hedging activities 
we currently engage in hedging activities in an effort to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices 
we enter into contracts with counterparties relating to our future natural gas requirements that lock in prices with respect to predetermined percentages of our expected future natural gas needs in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and gain predictability 
we recognize that if risk is not timely and adequately balanced or if counterparties fail to perform contractual obligations  actual results could differ materially from intended results 
all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet with gains and losses from effective instruments deferred in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  while gains and losses from ineffective overhedged instruments are recognized as the fair value of the derivative instrument changes 
our policy is consistent with the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas as amended by sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of february   of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the remainder of year is hedged at an average price of per dekatherm dth 
in addition  approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dth  approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dth  and approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dth 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include market conditions in the energy industry  especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commodity commitments  regulatory and political environments and requirements  fair value estimations on longer term contracts  estimating underlying fuel demand and counterparty ability to perform 
regulatory assets and liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  our financial statements reflect ratemaking policies prescribed by the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over us ferc and four states 
certain expenses and credits  normally recognized as incurred  are deferred as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet until the time they are recovered from or refunded to customers 
this is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
we have recorded certain regulatory assets which are expected to result in future revenues as these costs are recovered through the ratemaking process 
historically  all costs of this nature which are determined by our regulators to have been prudently incurred have been recoverable through rates in the course of normal ratemaking procedures  and we believe that the regulatory assets and liabilities we have recorded will be afforded similar treatment 
as of december   we have recorded  in regulatory assets and  in income taxes  gain on interest rate derivatives and costs of removal as regulatory liabilities 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for detailed information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
we continually assess the recoverability of our regulatory assets 
under current accounting standards  regulatory assets and liabilities are eliminated through a charge or credit  respectively  to earnings if and when it is no longer probable that such amounts will be recovered through future revenues 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include regulatory environment  external decisions and requirements  anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact and the impact of deregulation and competition on ratemaking process and the ability to recover costs 
unbilled revenue 
at the end of each period we estimate  based on expected usage  the amount of revenue to record for energy that has been provided to customers but not billed 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include projecting customer energy usage and estimating the impact of weather and other factors that affect usage such as line losses for the unbilled period 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets fas 
this statement establishes standards for accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement  or anticipated retirement  of tangible long lived assets 
it requires us to record the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which the liabilities are incurred and to capitalize a corresponding amount as part of the book value of the related long lived asset 
in subsequent periods  we are required to adjust asset retirement obligations based on changes in estimated fair value  and the corresponding increases in asset book values are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
uncertainties as to the probability  timing or cash flows associated with an asset retirement obligation affect our estimate of fair value 
upon adoption of this standard on january   we have identified future asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of certain river water intake structures and equipment at the iatan power plant in which we have a ownership 
we also have a liability for future containment of an ash landfill at the riverton power plant 
the potential costs of these future liabilities are based on engineering estimates of third party costs to remove the assets in satisfaction of the associated obligations 
these liabilities have been estimated as of the expected retirement date  or settlement date  and have been discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate ranging from to depending on the settlement date 
revisions to these liabilities could occur due to changes in the cost estimates  anticipated timing of settlement or federal or state regulatory requirements 
upon adoption of this statement in the first quarter of  we recorded a non recurring discounted liability and a regulatory asset of approximately  because we expect to recover these costs of removal in electric rates 
this liability will be accreted over the period up to the estimated settlement date 
the balance at the end of was approximately  also  we reclassified the accrued cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement  which is not considered an asset retirement obligation under fas  from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability 
this balance sheet reclassification had no impact on results of operations 
as of december  and  this reclassification was million and million  respectively 
this estimated liability may be subject to further refinement pending further analysis  including the results of our depreciation study expected to be completed in the first quarter of in december  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to a change in the value of a physical asset or financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates or commodity prices 
wehandle our commodity market risk in accordance with our established energy risk management policy  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
we utilize derivatives to manage our gas commodity market risk and to help manage our exposure resulting from purchasing most of our natural gas on the volatile spot market for the generation of power for our native load customers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of significant financing through our issuance of commercial paper 
we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure to a certain percentage of total capitalization  as set by policy  and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
see notes and of notes to financial statements under item for further information 
if market interest rates average more in than in  our interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by less than  this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our commercial paper balances as of december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of coal  natural gas  and electricity and employ established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations  including utilizing derivatives 
we have entered into long term contracts for the purchase of coal in order to manage our exposure to fuel prices

all of our required supply of coal has been acquired at fixed prices including standard adjustments 
future coal supplies will be acquired using a combination of fixed pricing and price hedging strategies 
we are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas we must purchase to run our combustion turbine generators 
our natural gas procurement program is designed to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices 
we enter into contracts with counterparties relating to our future natural gas requirements that lock in prices with respect to predetermined percentages of our expected future natural gas needs in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and improve predictability
