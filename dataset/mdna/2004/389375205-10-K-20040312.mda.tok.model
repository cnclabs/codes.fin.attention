the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and the stations also pay commissions to the national sales representative on national advertising 
broadcast advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments and estimations that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical policies that require judgments or estimations in their application where variances in those judgments or estimations could make a significant difference to future reported results 
valuation of fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements broadcast licenses of television stations acquired by the company prior to january  were valued using a residual basis methodology analogous to goodwill where the excess of the purchase 
table of contents price over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets was attributed to the broadcast license 
the company values the broadcast licenses of any television stations acquired after using an income approach 
under this approach  a broadcast license is valued based on analyzing the estimated after tax discounted future cash flows of the station  assuming an initial start up operation maturing into an average performing station in a specific television market and giving consideration to other relevant factors such as the technical qualities of the broadcast license and the number of competing broadcast licenses within that market 
the company adopted this methodology to value broadcast licenses as the company believes this methodology has  in recent years  become the methodology generally used within the broadcast industry to value broadcast licenses 
some broadcast companies may use methods to value acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations different than those that are used by the company 
these different methods may result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
the company believes that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the federal communications commission fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market the length of time the broadcast license has allowed a station to operate 
television stations that have been broadcasting within a market for longer periods of time are generally viewed more often than newer television stations 
vhf stations generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fifteen to sixty nine because i vhf stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations  ii uhf signals are generally weaker than vhf signals and iii because historically  in the early years of uhf operations  uhf stations had disadvantaged channel positions on tv receivers and cable systems compared to vhf stations 
the quality of the broadcast signal and geographic location of the broadcast station within a market impacts viewership 
the viewership of a television station is influenced by a television station s physical location 
as an example  the value of being licensed to the largest city within a multi city market has more value than being licensed to the smallest city within that market 
a station s broadcast power level  antenna height and antenna location all influence the overall quality of a television signal and therefore potential viewership of the station 
all of these attributes are ultimately controlled by the broadcast license issued by the fcc 
the audience acceptance of the broadcast licensee s local news programming and community involvement 
a local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its own network programming 
the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audiences in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 

table of contents a local television station can be the number one station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on these factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  nbc and fox each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in the local market in which the station operates 
some broadcasting companies account for network affiliations as a significant component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that stations are popular because they have generally been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcast companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
in connection with the company s purchase of gray midamerica television in october and of kolo tv in december the company acquired television stations serving markets 
the methodology the company used to value these stations was based on the company s evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
the company believes that in these specific markets the company would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
the company bases this belief in part on the following of the markets that these newly acquired stations operate in  of these markets have four or fewer commercial television stations including the station owned by the company 
in the remaining four markets  the company s stations operate on vhf channels  see the discussion of vhf channels below 
also  in those four remaining markets the company s stations all rank among the top three most viewed stations in the market for both local news viewing and for overall viewing of programming  see the discussion of audience viewing below 
the company defines a commercial television station as a commercial broadcast station that bia has reported receiving at least a share of viewers  or more  in three of the four most recent rating periods 
of these stations  the average length of time the broadcast license has allowed these stations to operate is years with the shortest time period being years and the longest time period being years 
generally  networks desire to affiliate with established stations that have performed at a high level over time 
each of the stations acquired in have been continuously affiliated with at least one of the following major networks  abc  cbs or nbc  for substantially all of the years the respective station has been broadcasting and have been consistently affiliated with the same major network on average for years with the shortest time period being years and the longest time period being years 
of these stations  stations broadcast on vhf channels and three stations broadcast on uhf channels 
in the three markets in which the company broadcasts on a uhf channel  there are four or fewer commercial television stations including the station owned by the company in the market see the discussion of the number of stations in a market above 
of these markets  two are considered by the company to be multi city markets and each of the company s station s are licensed to the largest city within the multi city market 
generally  a network would rather affiliate with a station that is licensed to the largest city within a multi city market  because there are likely to be more viewers interested in the local news product of that station in comparison to stations licensed to smaller cities within the same market 

table of contents all stations broadcast using power levels  antenna heights and antenna locations that produce high quality television signals that cover large geographic areas 
within these markets  each of the company s stations rank among the top three viewed stations in each market for both local news and also for overall programming 
more specifically  of the stations  the stations local news programming ranking and the stations overall audience ranking within the station s market was number one at of the stations  number two at two of the stations and number three at three of the stations 
the stations that have a number three ranking are all in a single market and operate as a parent station with two satellite stations to better service smaller towns geographically distant from the primary station 
these audience rankings are based upon the company s review of market data for the november  july  may and february rating periods 
given the company s assumptions and the specific attributes of the stations the company acquired in see discussion above  the company ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation relationship in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms of the affiliation agreement that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
certain other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operational performance of that station 
as a result  the company believes that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that the company believes are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
if the company were to assign higher values to all of its network affiliations and less value to its broadcast licenses and if it is further assumed that such higher values of the network affiliations are definite lived intangible assets  this reallocation of value might have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
however  it should be noted that there is a diversity of practice and some broadcast companies have considered such an intangible asset to have a life ranging from to years depending on the specific assumptions utilized by those broadcast companies 
the following table reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations for all prior acquisitions of the company the first acquisition being in and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a hypothetical year amortization period

income taxes the company has deferred tax assets related to a approximately million in federal operating loss carryforwards which expire during the years through and b approximately million of various state operating loss carryforwards 
recoverability of these deferred tax assets requires at least in part  generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
the calculation of the company s deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are based  in part  upon certain assumptions and estimations by the company s management

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk based on the company s floating rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would increase the company s interest expense and decrease the company s income before income taxes for the year by approximately million 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million more than its carrying value 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in the prevailing interest rates at december  would result in an increase in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair market values are determined from quoted market prices where available or based on estimates made by investment bankers
