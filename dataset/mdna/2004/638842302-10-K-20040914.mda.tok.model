table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
our critical accounting policies include those listed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time title passes to the customer  which usually occurs upon shipment 
revenue from shipments where title passes upon delivery is deferred until the shipment has been delivered 
as part of the services we provide to our private label contract manufacturing customers  we may perform  but are not required to perform  certain research and development activities related to the development or improvement of their products 
while our customers typically do not pay directly for this service  the cost of this service is included as a component of the price we charge to manufacture and deliver their products 
additionally  we record reductions to gross revenue for estimated returns of private label contract manufacturing products and direct to consumer products 
the estimated returns are based upon the trailing six months of private label contract manufacturing gross sales and our historical experience for both private label contract manufacturing and direct to consumer product returns 
however  the estimate for product returns does not reflect the impact of a large product recall resulting from changes in regulatory requirements  product nonconformance or other factors as such events are not predictable nor is the related economic impact estimable 
inventory reserve we operate primarily as a private label contract manufacturer that builds products following receipt of customer specific purchase orders 
as a result  we have limited realization risk in finished goods and work in process inventories 
our inventory reserve primarily relates to  but is not necessarily limited to  realization risk for raw materials 
our estimate to reduce inventory to net realizable value is based upon expiration of the raw materials efficacy  foreseeable demand of raw materials  market conditions and specific factors that arise from time to time related to regulatory and other factors 
the reserve level reflects our historical experience 
if demand and or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory reserves may be required 
accounting for income taxes we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as property and equipment depreciation  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from final tax examination reviews 

table of contents we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would reverse the valuation allowance  which would be reflected as income tax benefit 
at june   based on the limited historical taxable income and the uncertainty about sufficient near term taxable income at that time  we believed that this evidence created sufficient uncertainty about the realizability of our net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance was recorded at june  at june   based on historical taxable income in the previous three years and the projection of taxable income for fiscal  we determined a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets was not required 
the reversal of the valuation allowance was reflected as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended june  additionally  we have not recorded us income tax expense for naie s retained earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested in naie are based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in naie s assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of naie and nai 
income tax laws are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review several factors that influence the ultimate disposition of naie s retained earnings declared as reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  nai s actual cash needs may exceed our current expectations or naie s actual cash needs may be less than our current expectations 
additionally  changes may occur in tax laws and or accounting standards that could change our conclusion about the status of naie s retained earnings 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the fiscal year we determine that amounts are no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of current and past due receivable balances that may not be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the current month private label contract manufacturing gross sales and a review of specific accounts 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the receivable balance under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  could materially change these expectations and additional allowance may be required 
defined benefit pension plan the plan obligation and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plan are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued based upon third party market quotations 
independent actuaries through the use of a number of assumptions determine plan obligation and annual pension expense 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligation include the discount rate and estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we use an average long term bond yield 
asset returns are based upon the historical returns of multiple asset 
table of contents classes to develop a risk free rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class 
the overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long term inflation component  the risk free rate of return and the associated risk premium 
a weighted average rate is developed based on the overall rates and the plan s asset allocation 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these policies 
results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts fiscal fiscal percent change fiscal percent change private label contract manufacturing direct to consumer marketing program total net sales cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit selling  general administrative expenses of net sales other income expense net income of net sales diluted net income per share fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated private label contract manufacturing net sales for the fiscal year ended june   increased million  or  over the prior year 
changes in currency exchange rates  namely the strengthening of the euro  contributed million dollars  or  of this growth 
excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  the remaining increase was due primarily to additional net sales of million  or  to our two largest customers 
net sales to our largest customer increased million due to higher volumes of established products in existing markets 
net sales to our second largest customer increased million from new products in existing markets and million from established products in existing markets 
additionally  net sales increased million from net sales to new customers and million due to incremental volumes sold to customers obtained in the fourth quarter of fiscal the dr 
cherry pathway to healing product line comprised of our direct to consumer net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and direct to consumer net sales remained consistent due to a reduction in our media spending investment in new television markets for the dr 
cherry pathway to healing tm product line  as the investment did not produce what we considered to be adequate results 
additionally  we experienced a reduction in new customer acquisitions from our primary television market  while the average order value remained consistent 
we have identified opportunities to improve the content and style of the television programs and anticipate introducing the upgraded television programs in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit margin remained consistent despite a percentage point increase in material cost as a percentage of net sales  due to a percentage point decrease in labor and overhead as a percentage of net sales 
our material cost as a percentage of net sales was million for fiscal and million in the prior year 
the increase in material cost as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in inventory reserves of  for specific inventory realization risks and  for products as a result of terminating the jennifer o neill signature line tm brand 
the inventory allowance as a percentage of gross inventory at june  remained consistent with june  additionally  percentage points of the 
table of contents increase related to a shift in our sales mix to higher volume  lower margin products in fiscal our labor and overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales were million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in labor and overhead as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs on higher net sales 
in june  we began the build out of tenant improvements for approximately  square feet at our vista facility 
we anticipate the build out will be completed by the end of our second quarter in fiscal we anticipate being able to initiate production activities in the third quarter of fiscal if we are unable to complete the build out and transition our operating activities as planned  we could experience a disruption in our manufacturing capabilities and incur additional costs to fulfill customer orders 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal in absolute dollars  however  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to compensation payments under our fiscal management incentive plan of million  higher property  product liability and general liability insurance costs of  and research and development initiatives of  during fiscal  we made significant investments in our research and development initiatives primarily in the areas of clinical studies  regulatory assistance and personnel 
clinical studies increased  over the prior year primarily for efficacy validation of products in production and development stages 
regulatory related costs increased  over the prior year for services provided to current and prospective customers for international product registration  international and domestic product compliance and other services 
personnel costs increased  over the prior year to strengthen our team in the areas of regulatory and product formulation along with the hiring of our new vice president of science and technology 
other expense increased over the prior year primarily due to a  charge in conjunction with refinancing our credit facility in may the charge related to a prepayment penalty and the write off of capitalized issuance costs and is included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
additionally  we received proceeds from the settlement of claims associated with the vitamin antitrust litigation of  in fiscal at june   we reduced our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on historical operating profits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal naie operates under a five year swiss federal and cantonal income tax holiday that ends june  following the expiration of our tax holiday  we anticipate naie s effective tax rate for swiss federal  cantonal and communal taxes will be approximately compared to our current effective rate of approximately our net income was million per diluted share in fiscal and million per diluted share in fiscal excluding the effect of the litigation settlement proceeds of  in the prior year  net income increased million compared to  per diluted share 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated private label contract manufacturing net sales for the fiscal year ended june   increased million  or  over the prior year primarily due to additional net sales to our second largest customer  partially offset by reduced volumes to four other customers 
net sales to our second largest customer increased million from established products in existing markets 
net sales to our largest customer were consistent with the prior year 
additionally  net sales increased  from net sales to new customers 
direct to consumer net sales for the fiscal year ended june   increased million  or  over the prior year 
the introduction of five new products generated  of the increase in net sales 
the remaining increase was due to higher volumes of existing products 
gross profit margin improved to from in the prior year due to a percentage point decrease in material cost as a percentage of net sales and a percentage point decrease in labor and overhead as a percentage of net sales 
our material cost as a percentage of net sales was million for fiscal and million in the prior year 
our labor and overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales were million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in labor and overhead as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs on higher net sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal and million of net sales in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to increases in direct to consumer fulfillment and recurring media costs of  associated with incremental sales  new direct to consumer media and production costs of  for introducing dr 
cherry s pathway to healing tm product line in several new television markets  sales and executive personnel costs of  research and development personnel costs of  insurance premiums of  information system costs of  and clinical study costs of  these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in legal costs   reduction in employee separation expenses  and  reduction of direct to consumer costs incurred in the prior year for improving customer service  processing and reporting 
we received proceeds from the settlement of claims associated with the vitamin antitrust litigation of  in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  federal tax legislation was passed allowing companies to carryback net operating losses for five years 
this resulted in recognition of a  income tax refund receivable  which was included as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended june  at june   we assessed the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
based on the historical operating losses and the uncertainty about sufficient near term taxable income  we believe that this evidence created sufficient uncertainty about the realizability of the net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance of million was recorded at june  our net income was million per diluted share in fiscal and million per diluted share in fiscal excluding the effect of the litigation settlement proceeds and income tax refund receivable of  in the prior year  net income increased million to  per diluted share compared to a net loss of  per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows provided by operating activities and availability of borrowings under our new credit facility 
in each of fiscal and  our operations provided million in cash flows compared to million in fiscal fiscal cash flows from operations included a million improvement in net income over the prior year  offset by changes in our working capital components 
cash flows from operations in fiscal included proceeds from the vitamin antitrust litigation of million 
excluding these proceeds  fiscal operations provided million in cash flows 
approximately million of our operating cash flow was generated by naie in fiscal as of june   naie s retained earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
accounts receivable as of june  increased million over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher net sales and an increase in days sales outstanding to days at june  from days at june  the increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to the timing of shipments at the end of fiscal inventory as of june  increased million over the prior year primarily due to higher anticipated demand for fiscal additionally  accounts payable as of june  increased million over the prior year primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and disbursements to vendors 
accounts payable as a percentage of inventory was at june  versus at june  cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures were primarily for the continuing investment in domestic manufacturing equipment to improve efficiency and capacity 
additionally  fiscal capital expenditures included  for the tenant improvements in the newly leased  square feet at our vista facility 
we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal will be no less than million  net of a  tenant improvement allowance that will be funded by our landlord at the vista facility 
the capital expenditures will be primarily used to complete our tenant improvements and acquire additional equipment to expand our manufacturing capacity 
under our credit facility  capital expenditures for fiscal may not exceed million without approval from our lender 

table of contents our consolidated debt increased to million at june  from million at june  on may   we entered into a new million credit facility with a bank to refinance our then existing credit facility 
the new facility is comprised of an million working capital line of credit and million in term loans 
the working capital line of credit has a year term  is secured by our accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment  has an interest rate of libor plus and borrowings are subject to eligibility requirements for current accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the term loans consist of a  ten year term loan with a twenty year amortization  secured by our san marcos building at an interest rate of libor plus  a million four year term loan to refinance our outstanding term loan under the previous credit facility  secured by our accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment  at an interest rate of libor plus  and a million five year term loan  secured by equipment  at an interest rate of libor plus 
monthly payments on the term loans are approximately  plus interest 
as of june   we had million available under the working capital line of credit  net of a  outstanding letter of credit issued to our landlord 
under our credit facility  we may not create  incur or assume additional indebtedness without the approval of our lender 
on january   we purchased option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in euros 
the option contracts had a notional amount of million and a purchase price of  the premium associated with each option contract is marked to market and realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date in cost of good sold 
the risk of loss associated with purchased options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately  had been charged to cost of goods sold for option contracts outstanding during the year 
there are no other derivative financial instruments at june  as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we plan on funding our current working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt payments using available cash  cash flow from operations and our new credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor do we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  dollars in thousands 
contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases construction agreement purchase obligation total obligations operating lease obligations are shown net of  in sublease rental income that should be received through october construction agreement obligation is shown net of  tenant improvement allowance funded by our landlord under the terms of our lease agreement 
in june we entered into a commitment to purchase certain proprietary raw materials from a supplier ratably over the first six months of fiscal the monthly purchases will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements as they occur 
this purchase commitment was made in anticipation of future demand 
there can be no guarantee  however  that such future demand will occur 

table of contents inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin was revised in december and clarifies the application of arb to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the application of fin may require that an entity be subject to consolidation even though the investor does not have a controlling financial interest that  under arb  was usually deemed to exist through ownership of a majority voting interest 
fin  as revised  is generally effective for all entities subject to the interpretation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  we have no investments in entities within the scope of fin and as a result the application of fin had no material effect on our financial statements 
in december  fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits revised statement 
revised statement revises employers required disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by fasb statements no 
 employers accounting for pensions  no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
revised statement requires disclosures in addition to those in the original statement no 
revised statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures required by revised statement are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we adopted revised statement beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements or related footnotes 
risks you should carefully consider the risks described below  as well as the other information in this report  when evaluating our business and future prospects 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your investment in our common stock 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  our revenues would be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or a significant change in its business or personnel 
we have in the past  and expect to continue  to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers 
during the fiscal year ended june   sales to one customer  nsa international  inc  were approximately of our total net sales 
our second largest customer was mannatech  incorporated  which accounted for approximately of our net sales 
the loss of either of these customers or other major customers  a significant decrease in sales to these customers  or a significant change in their business or personnel  would materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our future growth and stability depends  in part  on our ability to diversify our net sales 
our efforts to establish new products  brands  markets and customers could require significant initial investments  which may or may not result in higher net sales and improved financial results 
our business strategy depends in large part on our ability to develop new products  marketing strategies  brands and customer relationships 
these activities often require a significant up front investment including  among others  customized formulations  regulatory compliance  product registrations  package design  product testing  pilot production runs  marketing and the build up of initial inventory 
we may experience significant delays from the time 
table of contents we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time we generate net sales from new products or customers  and it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from new products or customers after incurring such expenditures 
if we incur significant expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our operating results will vary and there is no guarantee that we will earn a profit 
fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect the share price of our common stock 
while our net sales and income from operations have both improved during the past three fiscal years  there can be no assurance that they will continue to improve  or that we will earn a profit in any given year 
we have experienced losses in the past and may incur losses in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to various factors including differences related to the timing of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes and other factors described in this report 
at times  these fluctuations may be significant 
fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect the share price of our common stock 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our customers  which in turn is affected by the level of consumer demand for their products 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn may adversely affect the disposable income of many consumers and may lower demand for the products we produce for our private label contract manufacturing customers  as well as for our direct to consumer products 
a decline in consumer demand and the level of business activity of our customers due to economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins 
because our direct to consumer sales rely on the marketability of key personalities  the inability of a key personality to perform his or her role or the existence of negative publicity surrounding a key personality may adversely affect our revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   our direct to consumer products accounted for approximately of our net sales 
these products are marketed with a key personality through a variety of distribution channels 
the inability or failure of a key personality to fulfill his or her role  or the ineffectiveness of a key personality as a spokesperson for a product  a reduction in the exposure of a key personality or negative publicity about a key personality may adversely affect the sales of our product associated with that personality and could affect the sale of other products 
a decline in sales would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively 
increased competition could adversely affect our financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources and broader name recognition than we do 
our larger competitors may be able to devote greater resources to research and development  marketing and other activities that could provide them with a competitive advantage 
our market has relatively low entry barriers and is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture a significant market share 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross profit margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
we may not be able to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing if needed 
our cash from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and or to implement our business strategies 
although we obtained a new million line of credit in may  there can be no assurance that this line of credit will be sufficient to meet our needs 
furthermore  if we fail to maintain certain loan covenants we will no longer have access to the credit line 
as a result  we may need to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing 
in recent years  it has been difficult for companies to raise capital due to a variety of factors including the overall 
table of contents poor performance of the stock markets and the economic slowdown in the united states and other countries 
thus  there is no assurance we would be able to raise additional capital if needed 
to the extent we do raise additional capital  the ownership position of existing stockholders could be diluted 
similarly  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if needed or that it will be available on favorable terms 
under the terms of our credit facility  we may not create  incur or assume additional indebtedness without the approval of our lender 
our inability to raise additional capital or to obtain additional financing if needed would negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategies and meet our goals 
this  in turn  would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of our suppliers to supply quality materials in sufficient quantities  at a favorable price  and in a timely fashion could adversely affect the results of our operations 
we buy our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers 
during fiscal  carrington laboratories incorporated was our largest supplier  accounting for of our total raw material purchases 
the loss of carrington laboratories incorporated or other major supplier could adversely affect our business operations 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our raw materials  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages  with a resulting loss of sales and customers 
in certain situations we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different materials from alternative sources 
we rely solely on one supplier to process certain raw materials that we use in the product line of our largest customer 
the loss of or unexpected interruption in this service would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a shortage of raw materials or an unexpected interruption of supply could also result in higher prices for those materials 
although we may be able to raise our prices in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials  we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently or quickly enough to offset the negative effects of the cost increases on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the quality raw materials needed by us in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay 
because we do not control the actual production of these raw materials  we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions outside of our control  including weather  transportation interruptions  strikes and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity  which could negatively affect our sales and revenues 
our business can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception about our industry  our competitors  or our business generally 
this adverse publicity may include publicity about the nutritional supplements industry generally  the efficacy  safety and quality of nutritional supplements and other health care products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations  regardless of whether these investigations involve us or the business practices or products of our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid any adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future 
any adverse publicity or negative public perception will likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations also could be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies are alleged to be or are proved to be harmful to consumers or to have unanticipated health consequences 
we could be exposed to product liability claims or other litigation  which may be costly and could materially adversely affect our operations 
we could face financial liability due to product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of injury to consumers from tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
we could be exposed to future product liability claims that  among others our products contain contaminants  we provide consumers with inadequate instructions about product use  or we provide inadequate warning about side effects or interactions of our products with other substances 

table of contents we maintain product liability insurance coverage  including primary product liability and excess liability coverage 
the cost of this coverage has increased dramatically in recent years  while the availability of adequate insurance coverage has decreased 
there can be no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available at an economically reasonable cost or that our insurance will be adequate to cover any liability we may incur 
additionally  it is possible that one or more of our insurers could exclude from our coverage certain ingredients used in our products 
in such event  we may have to stop using those ingredients or rely on indemnification or similar arrangements with our customers who wish to continue to include those ingredients in their products 
a substantial increase in our product liability risk or the loss of customers or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as we continue to expand into markets outside the united states our business becomes increasingly subject to political and economic risks in those markets  which could adversely affect our business 
our future growth may depend  in part  on our ability to continue to expand into markets outside the united states 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our presence in our existing markets outside the united states  enter new markets on a timely basis  or that new markets outside the united states will be profitable 
there are significant regulatory and legal barriers in markets outside the united states that we must overcome 
we will be subject to the burden of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  including multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting laws 
we also may experience difficulties adapting to new cultures  business customs and legal systems 
our sales and operations outside the united states are subject to political  economic and social uncertainties including  among others changes and limits in import and export controls  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes in government regulations and laws  coordination of geographically separated locations  absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights  changes in currency exchange rates  economic and political instability  and currency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the united states 
any changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect our business  profitability and growth prospects 
as we continue to expand into markets outside the united states  these and other risks associated with operations outside the united states are likely to increase 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation  which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets and could increase our costs 
the manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution  and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
failure to comply with governmental regulations may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by a governmental agency could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in addition  if the governmental agency has reason to believe the law is being violated for example  if it believes we do not possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
governmental agency enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action by the governmental agency could materially adversely affect our ability and our customers ability to successfully market those products 
in markets outside the united states  before commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
approvals 
table of contents or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
furthermore  the regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the united states and with each other 
the sale of our products in europe is subject to the rules and regulations of the european union  which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the union 
the cost of complying with these various and potentially conflicting regulations can be substantial and can adversely affect our results of operations 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations  when and if adopted  would have on our business 
they could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel  our business will suffer 
our executive officers and other management personnel are primarily responsible for our day to day operations 
we believe our success depends largely on our ability to attract  maintain and motivate highly qualified management personnel 
competition for qualified individuals can be intense  and we may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and on reasonable terms 
our inability to retain a skilled professional management team could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our goals 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
we currently manufacture the vast majority of our products at our manufacturing facilities in california 
as a result  we are dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of those facilities 
our manufacturing operations are subject to power failures  the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of governmental agencies  including the fda 
in addition  we may in the future determine to expand  relocate or consolidate our manufacturing facilities  which may result in slow downs or delays in our manufacturing operations 
while we maintain business interruption insurance  there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities in california or at naie s facility in switzerland would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any losses that we may incur from an interruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we possess and may possess in the future certain proprietary technology  trade secrets  trademarks  tradenames and similar intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation in the united states or abroad may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
this litigation  even if successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license would be available on terms acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
collectively  our officers and directors own a significant amount of our common stock  giving them influence over corporate transactions and other matters and potentially limiting the influence of other stockholders on important policy and management issues 
our officers and directors  together with their families and affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of june  as a result  our officers and directors could influence such business matters as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 

table of contents various transactions could be delayed  deferred or prevented without the approval of stockholders  including transactions resulting in a change in control  mergers and acquisitions  tender offers  election of directors  and proxy contests 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to the officers and directors who own shares of our common stock or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to us or our other stockholders 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options and other equity based compensation could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently follow apb and its related interpretations for stock options granted to employees and board members 
under the recognition and measurement principles of apb  we are not required to recognize any compensation expense unless the market price of the stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant or the terms of the grant are subsequently modified 
fasb has issued a proposal to change the recognition and measurement principles for equity based compensation granted to employees and board members 
under the proposed rules  we could be required to recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees and board members 
if approved  the proposed rule could result in significant compensation expense charges to our future results of operations 
if our information technology system fails  our operations could suffer 
our business depends to a large extent on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions  including order processing  customer service  product manufacturing and distribution  cash receipts and payments and financial reporting 
a long term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day to day business 
if certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law are triggered  the future price investors might be willing to pay for our common stock could be limited 
certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware corporate law help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our business  even if the proposal benefits our stockholders 
our board of directors is authorized  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having such rights  preferences  and privileges  including voting rights  as the board designates 
the rights of our common stockholders will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
any or all of these provisions could delay  deter or prevent a takeover of our company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
our stock price could fluctuate significantly 
our stock price has been volatile in recent years 
the trading price of our stock could fluctuate in response to broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions  fluctuations in our financial results  future offerings of our common stock or other securities  the general condition of the nutritional supplement industry  increased competition  regulatory action  adverse publicity  manipulative or illegal trading practices by third parties  and product and other public announcements 

table of contents the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will continue to exist or that the price of our common stock will not decline 
our future operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
from time to time our shares may be listed for trading on one or more foreign exchanges  with or without our prior knowledge or consent 
certain foreign exchanges may have less stringent listing requirements  rules and enforcement procedures than the nasdaq stock market or other markets in the united states  which may increase the potential for manipulative trading practices to occur 
these practices  or the perception by investors that such practices could occur  may increase the volatility of our stock price or result in a decline in our stock price  which in some cases could be significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may  however  enter into financial instruments to try to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates or other market risks or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the actual impact of any fluctuations in interest or foreign currency exchange rates may differ significantly from those discussed below 
interest rates at june   we had fixed rate debt of  and variable rate debt of approximately million 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt range from libor plus to libor plus 
as of june   the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 
an immediate one hundred basis point increase in the interest rates on our variable rate debt  holding other variables constant  would have increased our interest expense by  for the fiscal year ended june  interest rates have been at or near historic lows in recent years 
there can be no guarantee that interest rates will not rise 
any increase in interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
foreign currencies to the extent our business continues to expand outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accounting practices require that our non united states dollar denominated transactions be converted to united states dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net income may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
when the united states dollar strengthens against currencies in which products are sold or weakens against currencies in which we incur costs  net sales and costs could be adversely affected 
our main exchange rate exposures are with the swiss franc and the euro against the united states dollar 
this is due to naie s operations in switzerland and the payment in euros by our largest customer for finished goods 
additionally  we pay our naie employees and certain operating expenses in swiss francs 
we may enter into forward exchange contracts  foreign currency borrowings and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency risk 
our goal in seeking to manage foreign currency risk is to provide reasonable certainty to the functional currency value of foreign currency cash flows and to help stabilize the value of non united states dollar denominated earnings 
on january   we bought option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in euros 
the option contracts had a notional amount of million  a weighted average strike price of  and a purchase price of  the risk of loss associated with the options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts 
as of june   we had not exercised any of the options and six of the options had expired 

table of contents on june   the swiss franc closed at to united states dollar and the euro closed at to united states dollar 
a adverse change to the exchange rates between the swiss franc and the euro against the united states dollar  holding other variables constant  would have decreased our net income for the fiscal year ended june  by
