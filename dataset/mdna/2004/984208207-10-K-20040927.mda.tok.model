item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of yak communications inc and subsidiaries  and the related notes to the financial statements 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and have been audited by our independent auditors 
the financial information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refers to our continuing operations 
overview we are a facilities based reseller of discount  long distance telecommunication services in canada and the us to residential customers 
we primarily concentrate our marketing efforts towards consumers that make significant amounts of international calls  directly targeting ethnic markets and communities in major urban centers 
we have consistently addressed the needs of the market where the other dial around companies simply do not operate 
this market niche is the fastest growing and most profitable in the long distance space today 
on average  prices for long distance to developing countries are more than that of developed countries 
due to our focus on international calling  despite the continuing downward pressure on long distance revenue experienced by the major carriers  we continue to grow our revenue base 
our customer base is completely diversified across all ethnic communities which means we are subject to a minimal risk of significant rate changes as a result of deregulation or other unforeseen political events in particular countries 
we also offer end to end telecommunications services to small to medium business enterprises in the canadian market 
our focus is to provide the highest quality  competitively priced telecommunications services to existing markets 
we realize that dial around long distance is a commodity and there will be a point in the future when we saturate our own marketplace 
as a result  we intend to leverage the cash flow that this business provides in order to transition into significantly higher growth  higher margin emerging markets such as voip 
products our primary residential product offering is dial around services also known as casual calling at variable and flat rate pricing 
casual calling allows our customers to dial around their existing long distance carrier on any call by entering a few digits prior to making the call  without permanently switching long distance carriers 
we offer 
table of contents billing which allows our customers to permanently switch all of their calls from their existing long distance carrier to our long distance service 
we have continued to experience significant year over year growth in our dial around business 
currently of our dial around business comes from the canadian market  in which we are the dominant company as it pertains to market share 
per a report in november from idc  the dial around market in canada is expected to double in size to approximately million by we believe that there still exists an opportunity to grow the canadian market  and we continue to increase our focus on this core business in order to provide for the expansion of other areas of the business 
according to atlantic acm  the us long distance market is projected to decline from billion to billion by the dial around share of this market is approximately billion us and includes up to  competitors per idc estimates 
we initially launched into the us market with our dial around product in in three metropolitan areas las vegas  miami and washington  dc since the initial launch into the united states  we have continued to register with each state and have completed the loading and testing of all of our cic codes ie  and we have experienced a steady volume of dial around traffic in the us market without a focused and sustained marketing campaign 
as a result of the opportunity which we believe that exists in the us market  we anticipate launching a product in the fall we have entered into several contracts with both ethnic focused spokespersons as well as a targeted internet marketing company in order to further penetrate and grow our us operations 
in order to support this expansion  we have opened an office in aventura  florida 
although this market is intensely competitive  we believe that through the implementation of a strategically focused approach  there exists an opportunity to grow this market 
in november of  we introduced a dial around service in peru 
although currently a fraction of our total business  this provides yak with an opportunity to develop competing long distance services and proactively test the issues relating to the migration to a voip platform in international territories 
our offering to the sme market consists of competitively priced voice and data products of the highest quality and reliability 
in the near future  we will also introduce a broadband offering to the sme market 
we also offer telecom management services to the mid to large customer base through our subsidiary contour telecom 
on september  we launched our voip services worldcity voip to residential customers throughout the world 
we plan to offer a range of attractive packages that will satisfy the needs of our customers 
shortly after the launch of our residential offering  we will be announcing our product offering to the small and medium business market 
our core business is profitable and growing  and it is our plan to utilize the success of our core business to a launch an exciting array of value added products throughout the world 
networks over the past three years  we have established and expanded our own private leased line network throughout all major canadian provinces 
in addition  we have achieved the same network breadth in the us by interconnecting with a major us carrier 
currently this coast to coast carrier class sonet based network delivers all traffic 
in addition to the cost and control advantages of this network  we have purchased a class santeraone softswitch and media gateway 
the port density and significantly reduced foot print of this switch will enable us to transition our traffic from our legacy teltronics harris switches  resulting in tremendous cost savings 
the santera switch currently has  ports and is expandable to  ports 
our current level of traffic is using approximately  ports  as a result  we do not anticipate running out of capacity for the foreseeable future 
costs in addition to the direct cost savings associated with the transition to and operation of the santeraone platform  it has also afforded us the opportunity to bring a greater portion of our traffic onto our own network 
there is a savings of approximately 
per minute for traffic that is routed over our leased line network versus over the carrier s network 
in addition to the savings noted above  we also continually investigate other methods of reducing our variable direct costs including employing least cost routing of our international traffic  negotiating lower variable costs with multiple carriers to multiple destinations in order to achieve the lowest available cost per minute  and continuing to expand the capacity of our network to accommodate the growing demand in certain areas of the country 

table of contents voip according to industry sources  voip packet traffic reached an estimated billion minutes in and is expected to grow to billion minutes of use by broadband voice services represent a significant emerging market opportunity in the communications industry 
the service enables voice communication over broadband ip networks  significantly reducing costs to end users while bundling a broad array of value added services voicemail  call waiting  caller id  call forwarding  auto attendant  find me follow me  etc utilizing session initiated protocol sip  broadband voice services provides to name a few  greater flexibility  improved interoperability and quality of service  all challenges present in prior technologies 
per a recent study published by in stat mdr states  an estimated  households make internet calls with a standard phone  this number is expected to reach million by we are uniquely positioned to capture significant market share as broadband voice gains popularity among traditional phone users 
the company has initiated strong relationships with technology and network providers to incorporate broadband voice into the current offering 
leveraging its successful dial around business model and the market reach of current advertising  our voip initiative is expected to have a higher gross margin than our traditional dial around service as a result of the potential to carry a portion or all of the call over the internet 
foreign currency currently in excess of of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations in canada 
the functional currency for this revenue is the canadian dollar 
our reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
although we expect to derive less of our total business directly from canada in the future  exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations 
recent operating highlights and other events in order to better understand our discussion of results and operations  financial condition  and liquidity presented herein  we summarize below certain operating highlights and other events that occurred during the last two fiscal years 
operating highlights and accomplishments in we acquired the outstanding shares and debt of contour telecom inc and its wholly owned subsidiary argos telecom inc for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million

pro forma information as a result of the implementation of our current growth strategy  the company has incurred several one time costs to the business that have had a significant impact on the current period s earnings 
they include the following items impact of one time expenses impact on net income m usd impact on eps net income eps as reported estimated impact of one time events tax affected accelerated depreciation of old harris switches severance costs of integrating acquisitions due diligence costs re abandoned acquisition total adjusted net income critical accounting policies yak s consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies  risk and financial condition 
we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our management believes that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 

table of contents our critical accounting policies are as follows determining functional currency for the purpose of consolidation  and valuation of long lived assets 
determining functional currency for the purpose of consolidation we have a foreign subsidiary in canada that accounts for approximately of our revenue and of our assets as of june  in preparing our consolidated financial statements we translate the accounting records from canadian dollars into us dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 are included as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
under these provisions  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependant upon our management s determination of the functional currency of our subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment of the currency that its subsidiary conducts substantially all of its transactions  including billings  financing and other expenditures  which also includes the dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include i significant decrease in the market value of an asset  ii significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset  iv significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions  and v significant changes in technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of property and equipment may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
we decided to revise our estimates to accommodate more rapid depreciation with respect to our harris switches due to expected changes in relevant technologies 
the change in the estimated useful lives of these assets resulted in accelerated depreciation of million for the period ending june  net property and equipment totaled million as of june  which represents of our total assets

table of contents results of operations for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  we experienced steady growth of million in the dial around revenue  as a result of our advertising campaigns and the expansion of our network capability from coast to coast in the canadian market 
on a year over year basis  our revenue in western canada increased million  ontario and quebec grew by million  and eastern canada added million 
since we launched our products to the east coast of canada in october of  we have experienced continual growth 
the balance of the increase in our core revenue was as a result of our looneycall product which added revenues of million for the period ended june   compared to just million for the period ending june  revenue in our us operating territories decreased by million  or to million for the fiscal year 
the decrease was a result of management s decision to reduce advertising and readdress our strategy of further penetrating the us market 
as a result of the following factors  we expect to achieve significant growth in the u 
s market during the next fiscal year completion of the loading of our cic access codes in the mainland states launch of our product in the fall of targeted marketing campaigns using a variety of media including the internet  newspaper ads  flyers and commercials featuring various spokespeople the average rate per minute arpm that the company derives from our core dial around services was for the period ending june  as compared to for the period ended june  due to the competitive nature of the business and the fact that long distance services are a commodity product  we expect continual  gradual erosion in the arpm in the coming years 
see the discussion in direct costs below regarding the actions the company is taking to control costs and maintain margins 
the balance of the increase in revenues resulted from our july  acquisition of contour telecom inc contour and its subsidiary  argos telecom inc argos  which collectively added sales of million for the period ended june  in their first year under our ownership  contour achieved sales of million and argos achieved sales of million 
direct costs cost of revenue increased million or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the overall cost of revenue increased to of sales for the year ended june   from of sales for the year ended june  this increase in cost of sales is a result of the lower margins of our contour and argos businesses as compared to those of our core dial around operations 
as a result of the continual downward pressure on the price of long distance  our company is actively employing real time least cost routing algorithms and contracting with various carriers in order to manage the direct costs as efficiently as possible 
in addition  to further control costs  we have continued to build out our network  which enables us to bring a greater share of our traffic onto our own network  resulting in a higher utilization of our fixed cost access lines 
the table below presents a breakdown of the direct costs of our core dial around business into its long distance and other components all amounts in us dollars breakdown of direct cost for core revenue june  june  june  thousands core revenue long distance charges other fees gross margin core revenue includes dial around  looneycall and yakcell 
other fees include line access charges for our leased line network  occupancy  call processing fees  crtc contribution fees fees paid to the canadian government  and costs to originate and terminate traffic on our leased line network 

table of contents cost of revenue in our dial around business is comprised primarily of the cost of long distance services  fees for the processing and transporting of our calls and fixed and variable line access costs 
the cost of the pure long distance component of services has increased to million or for the year ended june   from million or for the year ended june  the decrease in the relative percentage of revenue is as a result of the company actively seeking out competitive routes and the effect of deregulation on the cost of long distance in other international markets 
the cost of the other component of services has increased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june gross margins the overall gross margin for the company decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  the decrease in margin can be attributed to the acquisition of contour telecom and argos telecom  which account for of our consolidated revenue and have a combined gross margin of  and the decline in the gross margin of our core dial around business which decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  although the company continued to grow strongly from a revenue perspective  the proportion of higher margin international traffic declined 
we believe that the decline was as a result of the introduction of our looneycall product which had a stronger domestic presence  and the growth of call patterns within certain ethnic groups as our service offerings grew across canada 
we constantly analyze potential opportunities in the international market with regard to targeted campaigns  and believe there still remains high margin opportunities that can be utilized

table of contents general administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a increased million or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  of this increase  million can be attributed directly to our acquisition of contour and argos 
the remaining increase of g a of million can be attributed mainly to increases of salaries million  legal and audit million  occupancy million and consulting services million 
the largest component of the increase in g a was salaries  a result of hiring additional administration  technical and customer service employees that were required to support our growth during fiscal year  and support the launch of our voip product in the first quarter of fiscal it is anticipated that salaries will continue to increase in our broadband division as we add employees in the technical and customer service areas  proportionate to the growth of that business 
in addition  to facilitate the future growth of the company  we added five executives with extensive telecommunications experience to the management team which increased salaries by million for the period ended june  legal and audit expenses increased million or to million for year ended june  the majority of the increase was in professional fees including regulatory matters  support of our voip development  in addition to the costs associated with exploring the company s new growth opportunities and financing alternatives 
in addition  the company incurred costs of approximately million related to due diligence costs of an acquisition that was eventually abandoned 
expenditures for occupancy increased by million for the year ended june  as a result of the consolidation to our new offices at consilium place in toronto  ontario and the additional locations related to our purchase of argos and contour 
we would anticipate that our needs for more space in the future would increase to match the growth of the business 
please see the discussion in the properties section for a complete list of all of the properties currently under lease 
consulting services increased million to million for the year ended june  primarily as a result of expenditures for consultants that were hired to assist with the restructuring and integration work related to argos telecom and contour telecom 
due to the magnitude of work involved with our efforts to become sarbanes oxley compliant in fiscal  we expect an increase of approximately  in the use of consultants during the next fiscal year 
sales marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the cost of advertising increased million to million for the year ended june  in our canadian territory  primarily due to increased direct mail and promotional activities for our dial around product in ontario  to support the introduction to the east coast and to grow the business in the rest of country 
spending for advertising in our us territory decreased by million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  upon entering the us market in  the company invested advertising dollars in specific metropolitan areas in order to increase our brand awareness 
the operating model that the company employed in canada was not as suitable in the more complex us market and management decided to retrench in the us market and reduced expenditures until our cic access codes were fully loaded and tested in all states and we had re strategized our marketing initiatives 
it is management s intention to significantly increase the amount of advertising in the us market to support the launch of our service in the first quarter of  through a focused campaign of flyers  tv commercials and internet based advertising

interest expense for the year ended june  under this note was  which was offset against the company s share of income from its joint marketing agreement of  after a period to further evaluate this software  management has made a decision to reclassify the long term note payable from june  of  to offset the software previously recorded 
this is due to the fact the long term note is non recourse and cash flow for the repayments is earned from our joint marketing agreement with the note holder 
consequently  management will only record its own cash payments under the long term note as consideration for the software 
financing accounts receivable financing costs related to the factoring of our trade accounts receivable remained flat at million for the year ended june  the increase in the growth of the business and the amount of the receivables that were being financed  was offset by the decrease in the interest rate charged 
the company renewed the terms of its million credit facility with textron financial during the year at more favorable terms than the previous agreement 
despite the amount of cash on hand at the present time  we do not intend to cease our program of factoring our receivables 
this decision is based on the favorable terms that we currently enjoy  in addition to our desire to use the cash on hand to finance the growth of our voip business and for possible future acquisitions 
organizational startup costs organizational and start up costs for the development of new operations were million for the period ending june   effectively unchanged for the period ending june  these costs were composed primarily of employee related expenses for the development of our broadband initiative million and organizational and start up costs million spent for the development of our international operations in peru

to date  we have financed our growth through the private placement of equity securities  borrowings  accounts receivable financing  vendor financing and capital lease financing 
net cash provided from operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  this was principally due to the increase in our net income from operating activities to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   the company used cash for acquisition of property and equipment of million  and used million in cash towards the acquisition of contour telecom inc on july  it is expected that we will continue to add to our network and network equipment in the coming year to support the growth of the business 
in addition  the company continues to actively pursue acquisitions that we believe will be accretive in nature to the existing business 
significant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under operating leases  capital leases  advances under contract and other agreements  as shown in the following table in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital leases telus advances carrier commitments total net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june   as compared to million provided by financing activities for the year ended june  the increase was as a result of our private placement of share in march  
table of contents in september  we acquired a state of the art santera switch for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million of which  was paid in cash and the balance of the price was financed over a period of months 
effective june  we completed a sales leaseback transaction and received proceeds of million  the nbv of the switch 
the term of the lease is months  and we will be required to make monthly payments of  leaving a residual amount owing of  at the end of the term 
at that time the company will have the option of making a one time payment to purchase the equipment or can choose to finance the remaining amount over an additional lease term 
in march  we completed a private placement of  of our common shares and  warrants for net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe we have sufficient fixed capacity to meet our anticipated volume of telephony traffic in both canada and the us during fiscal based on our current products  we do not anticipate spending additional capital on our switching platform in fiscal in addition  with the acquisition of the santera switch  we believe we are capable of providing for future long term growth  as well as accommodating technological change 
during the year ended june   the company focused on expanding its operations across canada and developing services in the us with our acquisition of contour occurring just after our fiscal year end  the company will be able to expand its customer base to small and medium business and to also expand telecommunication services offered to our customers 
for the twelve months ended june   argos telecom had revenue of million and  contour telecom had revenue of million 
we expect this amount to be substantially equal for the next months 
with the introduction of our voip product  we anticipate releasing a product aimed specifically at the small and medium business customer 
as a result  we would expect top line revenue growth and margin improvement in the argos division in the future 
as a result of the continued convergence of voice and data  the introduction of our voip product is significant because it provides the company a vehicle for future growth 
as broadband services gain a critical level of acceptance in the marketplace  the ability to bundle other services with this core offering will become the most important distinguishing factor between the many competitors 
we plan to continue to research and augment our core offerings with value added services that are priced competitively and address the demands of the market 
in addition to the introduction of our voip product  we plan to introduce a new product in the us market 
the introduction of this new product is consistent with our previously stated intentions of increasing our presence in the us market 
through new product introductions and potentially new acquisitions  we anticipate growing our customer base in the us market substantially over the medium to long term 
we believe that our current operations will be able to continue to generate sufficient cash to meet our current obligations and support the growth of the business through new product introductions eg voip and the launch of our product in the us market 
we have no further significant cash commitment to develop our international operations in peru 
we may seek to obtain additional funds from public or private equity or debt offerings to fund new opportunities that may arise

the matters discussed below could cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
factors  which could cause results to differ from expectations  include risks described in greater detail below 
our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers 
our success will depend on our ability to effectively anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands 
any failure of our current or prospective customers to purchase products from us for any reason  including a downturn in their business  would seriously harm our ability to grow our business 
in addition  our growth depends on our ability to successfully fund and develop new and enhanced products 
the development of new or enhanced products is a costly  complex and uncertain process that requires us to anticipate accurately future technological and market trends 
we cannot be sure whether our new product offerings will be successfully developed and introduced to the market on a timely basis  or at all 
if we do not develop these products in a timely manner  our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  as we introduce new or enhanced products  we must also manage the transition from older products to newer products 
if we fail to do so  we may disrupt customer ordering patterns or may not be able to ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
any failure to effectively manage this transition may cause us to lose current and prospective customers 
our business is dependent upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes 
the international telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  technological improvements  expansion of telecommunications infrastructure  privatization and the globalization of the world s economies 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not vary in a manner that could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on us 
in addition  deregulation in any particular market may cause such market to shift unpredictably 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or adjust our contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions 
the market for our services and the telecommunications industry generally is in a period of rapid technological evolution  marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and increasing transmission capacity for services similar to those provided by us 
failure to respond in a timely and cost effective way to these technological developments could result in serious harm to our business and operating results 
we have derived  and we expect to continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenues from providing telecommunications services that are based upon current technologies which are capable of adapting to future technologies 
as a result  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to afford the cost of acquiring new hardware and software associated with new technologies  develop and market service offerings that have significant customer demand  respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our customers  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
the company s profitability will depend on its ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to access or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price  maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms 
the increase of services offered by our competitors could adversely impact our business 
recently  telecommunications providers have increased the range of telecommunication services they offer to customers 
this activity and the potential continuing trend towards offering services may lead to a greater ability among our competitors to provide a comprehensive range of telecommunications services  which could lead to a reduction in demand for our services 
moreover  by offering certain services to end users  competitors could reduce the number of our current or potential customers and increase the bargaining power of our remaining customers  which may adversely impact our business 
our business is susceptible to severe pricing pressures from the larger carriers 
the long distance telecommunications industry is significantly impacted by the marketing campaigns and associated pricing decisions of the larger carriers 
there has been downward pressure on prices in the industry in recent years  a trend that we expect to continue 
our competitors within the canadian market include bce  telus  and allstream  and as we launch our products into the us market  our competitors will likely include at t  mci  sprint  the rbocs and the major wireless carriers in the united states 
we would also expect that the competition will be intense in certain emerging markets including our voip product 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger networks  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  and long standing relationships with our target customers 
as a result  our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected 
the success of our broadband initiative is dependent on growth and public acceptance of ip telephony as well as our ability to adapt to rapid technological changes in ip telephony 
the development of broadband telephony in canada and the united states is in its nascent stages 
it is uncertain as to how competition in our markets for telephony opportunities provided by broadband applications will develop 
the financial models for return on pricing  capital expenditures and return on investment have not been fully developed so it is difficult to gauge what applications will be financially successful 
the success of our broadband initiative is dependent upon future demand for ip telephony systems and services which  in turn  will depend on a number of factors including ip telephony achieving a similar level of reliability that users of the public switched telephone network have come to expect from their telephone service 
ip telephony service providers must offer cost and feature benefits to their customers that are sufficient to cause the customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers 
if any or all of these factors fail to occur  our broadband business may not grow 
in addition  since ip telephony is an emerging market characterized by rapid technological advancement and product enhancement  we must continue to design  develop  manufacture  and sell new and enhanced ip telephony products and services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost 
these new and enhanced products must take advantage of technological advancements and changes  and respond to new customer requirements 
table of contents the regulatory environment affecting our broadband initiative is largely unknown 
to date voip communication services have been largely unregulated in canada and the united states 
the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission  or crtc  has previously decided not to regulate the internet  therefore  it is unclear if this exemption will apply to voip telephone service 
the incumbent carriers in canada  including bell canada and telus  have requested the crtc to regulate voip 
although we expect canadian regulation of voip telephone service to be minimal  such regulations could have an adverse affect on our ability to deploy our broadband initiative effectively 
many regulatory actions are underway or are being contemplated by us federal and state authorities  including the federal communications commission  or fcc  and state regulatory agencies 
to date  the fcc has treated internet service providers as information service providers 
information service providers are currently exempt from federal and state regulations governing common carriers  including the obligation to pay access charges and contribute to the universal service fund 
if the fcc were to determine that internet service providers  or the services they provide  are subject to fcc regulation  including the payment of access charges and contribution to the universal service funds  it could have a material adverse effect on our broadband initiative 
in addition  state regulatory authorities may determine that ip telephony service should be subject to local regulation  certification and fees 
the effect of potential future voip telephony laws and regulations on our broadband initiative cannot be determined 
any future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we intend to expand our operations through acquisitions over time 
this may require significant management time and financial resources because we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to manage future acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our stockholders would be diluted if we financed the acquisitions by incurring convertible debt or issuing securities 
the current expansion of the company will continue to put pressure on management 
our continued growth and expansion may place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources  and increase demand on our systems and controls 
we entered the sme market in july of  and plan to launch our voip service and expand into the us market in the fall of to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize other transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we inaccurately forecast the movement of traffic onto our network  we could have insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
as we proceed with our development  operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer support  billing and management information systems  on our support  sales and marketing and administrative resources and on our network infrastructure 
we have a significant dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
we primarily connect our customers telephone calls through transmission lines that we lease under a variety of arrangements with other facilities based long distance carriers 
many of these carriers are  or may become  our competitors 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with the facilities based carriers from which we lease transmission lines 
if our relationship with one or more of these carriers were to deteriorate or terminate  it could have a material adverse effect upon our cost structure  service quality  network diversity  results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations could subject us to risks due to currency fluctuations and changes in foreign government regulations  which could harm our business 
our current international outside of canada operations  and any future expansion outside of canada  are or will be subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign governmental regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
the majority of our sales and expenses have been denominated in us dollars 
however  the significant majority of our sales and expenses occur in canada 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and 
table of contents the canadian currency could cause foreign currency translation gains or losses that we would recognize in the period incurred 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
we are in an industry governed by significant government regulation 
the telecommunications industry is subject to constantly changing regulation 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us  or that regulatory bodies will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us 
although largely unregulated at the current time  voip could face material changes with regards to its regulatory framework that could result in additional fees or price structures that could have a material  adverse effect on our results 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and other trading market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
our quarterly results may fluctuate causing our stock price to decline 
a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  are likely to cause these fluctuations 
the factors outside of our control include long distance telecommunications market conditions as well as economic conditions generally  fluctuations in demand for our services  reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors  costs of integrating technologies or businesses that we add  and changes in foreign exchange rates 
the factors substantially within our control include the timing of expansion into new markets  both domestically and internationally  and the timing and payments associated with possible acquisitions 
because our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and our common stock could decline significantly which may expose us to risks of securities litigation  impair our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals using equity incentives and make it more difficult to complete acquisitions using equity as consideration 
lower rates by ilecs 
the long distance telecommunications industry is intensely competitive with relatively limited barriers to entry 
in the more deregulated countries we operate and with numerous entities competing for the same customers 
as a result  we will continue to experience extreme pricing pressure  and we must constantly maintain our focus in order to grow our customer base 
due to the significantly larger resources at the disposal of the ilecs  we would not be able to sustain our operations in the face of a major price reduction 
impact on future rental costs for our network 
we primarily terminate our customers calls through lines that we lease from other facilities based long distance carriers 
many of these carriers are  or may become  our competitors 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with the facilities based carriers from which we lease transmission lines 
if our relationship with one or more of these carriers were to deteriorate  it could have a material adverse effect upon our cost structure  service quality  network diversity  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency currently in excess of of our revenue is derived from sales and operations in canada 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
the functional currency for each of our operating entities is the respective local currency 
in the future we expect to derive a greater proportion of our revenues outside of canada  however  in the short term  changes in the exchange rate may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the us dollar canadian dollar 
we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our canadian subsidiary 
we translate the canadian dollar statements of operations into us dollar using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year 
as an example  if the us dollar were to strengthen relative to the canadian dollar  it would take a greater amount of revenue and profits in canadian dollars to achieve a similar level of results in us dollars compared to the previous year 
in the year ended june   the us dollar weakened compared to the canadian dollar 
as a result  the revenue from our canadian subsidiary not including acquisitions increased in canadian dollars  but increased when stated in us dollars
