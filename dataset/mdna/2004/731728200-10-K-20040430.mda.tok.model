results of operations fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  fy fy fy net loss loss per share the fiscal year reduction in net loss is attributable to the recovery of income tax expense 
in fiscal year  there was a recovery of income taxes of  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  in fiscal year  due to the recognition of the tax benefit of the non operating losses at chemdex  as described below 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year significantly exceeded income before income taxes because of the losses incurred at the company level in the bahamas  for which no tax recovery is available  and because a full valuation allowance was taken against the deferred tax assets relating to non operating losses at chemdex 
income loss before fiscal years income taxes fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated dextran products chemdex the fiscal year decline in operating results is primarily attributable to the large foreign exchange loss and gross margin decline at dextran products due to the decline in the united states dollar relative to the canadian dollar 
dextran products has a significant net asset exposure to the united states dollar because the majority of its accounts receivable balance and intercompany receivables are denominated in united states dollars  while the majority of its liabilities and expenses are in canadian dollars 
therefore  if the value of the canadian dollar increases in relation to the united states dollar  margins decrease 
exchange rate fluctuations resulted in an decrease in margins at dextran products in fiscal year management does not expect that the company will incur significant foreign exchange losses in fiscal year  due to the expected repayment of intercompany debts owed by chemdex to dextran products in fiscal year additionally  in fiscal year the company continued to incur significant legal and receiver costs due to the winding up of the joint venture and resulting litigation with its joint venture partner 
on march   the company sold its finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business to sparhawk 
the sale included substantially all of the assets of vet labs and its ownership interest in the joint venture  and settled all outstanding litigation among the parties 
the company does not expect to incur significant legal or receiver costs in connection with vet labs or the joint venture following the date of sale 
dextran products 
the fiscal year decrease in income before income taxes is a result of the rise in the value of the canadian dollar  which resulted in the decrease in profit margins described above  as well as an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which are stated in united states dollars  and a foreign exchange loss 
the fiscal year increase compared to fiscal year was due to increased sales and gross profit levels 
chemdex 
the fiscal year decrease in loss before income taxes is a result of the increase in sales and profit margins 
the fiscal year decrease compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increased other expenses resulting from the winding up of the joint venture and the resulting litigation 
fiscal years sales fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated dextran products percentage of company sales chemdex percentage of company sales the majority of the fiscal year sales increase was attributable to the chemdex operating segment 
both operating segments experienced sales increases in fiscal year compared to fiscal year dextran products 
demand for dextran and related products increased in fiscal year due primarily to favorable pricing 
since dextran products pricing of product is primarily denominated in united states dollars  the decline in value of the united states dollar relative to the euro resulted in lower pricing for european agents  increasing demand for the products of dextran products 
increased demand across all markets drove the sales increase from fiscal year to fiscal year management expects sales levels to increase slightly in fiscal year due to increased sales in europe  absent a significant rise in the value of the united states dollar 
chemdex 
the introduction of three new products accounted for  of the fiscal year sales increase 
the fiscal year sales increase compared to fiscal year was due primarily to the introduction of a new contract manufactured product 
fiscal years gross profit fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated percentage of sales dextran products percentage of sales chemdex percentage of sales the fiscal year increase in gross profit resulted from increased sales at the chemdex operating segment 
the concurrent decline in gross profit percentage is primarily due to declines at the dextran products operating segment due to exchange rate fluctuations  which caused a decrease in margins 
the fiscal year increase in gross profit compared to fiscal year gross profit was the result of increased sales levels  particularly of higher margin products 
dextran products 
dextran products fiscal year gross profit decrease was due to the significant rise in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
the majority of dextran products costs are incurred in canadian dollars  while the majority of its sales are in united states dollars 
therefore  as the value of the canadian dollar rises in relation to the united states dollar  dextran products margins decrease 
exchange rate fluctuations resulted in an decrease in margins at dextran products in fiscal year the fiscal year increase in gross profit at dextran products compared to fiscal year was the result of increased sales of a high margin product 
chemdex 
the fiscal year increase in gross profit and margin at chemdex was primarily attributable to the increased sales levels  particularly in the high margin injectables product line  which resulted in lower average fixed costs 
the fiscal year increase in gross profit at chemdex compared to fiscal year was the result of increased sales due to the introduction of a new product 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses the fiscal year increase in selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses is a result of three main factors 
the cost of the company s director and officer liability insurance increased by as compared to fiscal year  due to general market conditions 
the company has not made a claim under any director and officer liability policy 
management salaries at chemdex also included a full year of salary for the general manager who was hired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year finally  the selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses incurred at dextran products were incurred in canadian dollars  resulting in increased expenses upon translation to united states dollars due to the significant rise in the canadian dollar as discussed above 
the fiscal year increase in selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal year was a result of senior management bonus accruals of  in fiscal year no senior management bonuses were paid in fiscal year in addition  chemdex incurred increased management salaries and recruiting costs in connection with the hiring of a new general manager in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to oversee the joint venture operations and its management on behalf of the company 
research and fiscal years development fy fy fy v v increase decrease research and development expenditures investment tax credits net research and development expense due to continued direct funding of research and development expenses by third party public and or private sector groups  as well as investment tax credits claimed by dextran products  the company s research and development expense continued to decrease in fiscal year funding for the company s primary development products is provided directly by third party public and or private sector groups to the entities carrying out such research 
the company does not take possession or control over these funds 
the company benefits from the results of research projects through the ownership of patents and or licenses with respect to the products involved 
the company has no commitments to repay the funding or to purchase the results of the research 
the current stage of the cellulose sulphate project is such that a lesser portion of development is being performed in house  and significant funding from research and development partners for the current phase of the project is expected to continue at necessary levels for the foreseeable future 
the company s research and development expenditures are expected to increase in fiscal year due to additional product development activities the company expects to perform and fund outside of its partnership relationships 
additionally  chemdex experienced a reduction in research and development costs in fiscal year while awaiting fda approval on several new products 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease depreciation and amortization expense the fiscal year increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily attributable to new production equipment purchased during fiscal year at dextran products and the increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
the fiscal year increase compared to fiscal year is primarily due to the purchase of new production equipment at dextran products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease interest expense the fiscal year decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in long term debt  as well as the associated decrease in imputed interest due to the continuing repayment of non interest bearing long term debt 
the fiscal year decrease compared to fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease in imputed interest on long term payables due to the repayment of non interest bearing long term debt 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease foreign exchange gain loss the fiscal year increase in foreign exchange loss at dextran products was due to the canadian dollar increasing in value relative to the united states dollar 
dextran products has a net exposure to the united states dollar because the majority of its accounts receivable balance  including inter company receivables  is denominated in united states dollars 
the fiscal year increase in foreign exchange loss at dextran products was due to a similar increase in the value of the canadian dollar 
the fiscal year foreign exchange gain at dextran products was due to the canadian dollar decline in value relative to the united states dollar during that period 
management does not expect that the company will incur significant foreign exchange losses in fiscal year  due to the expected repayment of intercompany debts owed by chemdex to dextran products in fiscal year fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease other income expense in both fiscal years and  the other expenses relate almost entirely to legal and receiver costs associated with the winding up of the joint venture  and the resulting litigation 
in fiscal year  legal and receiver fees relating to this process totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year additionally  due to the uncertainty related to this situation  in fiscal year  the company provided an allowance for the entire receivable balances of  due from sparhawk 
in fiscal year other income was primarily due to the receipt by chemdex of a final settlement payment of  resulting from a class action lawsuit against various vitamin suppliers 
also in fiscal year  dextran products incurred a loss of  on disposal of production equipment that was netted against other income 
fiscal years tax provision recovery fy fy fy v v increase decrease consolidated dextran products chemdex the fiscal year decrease in tax provision at dextran products is a result of the decrease in profitability as described above 
the tax provision at dextran products exceeds its income before taxes because a significant portion of the foreign exchange loss relates to intercompany financing and consequently is deductible only against capital gains 
the canadian operations continue to have significant research and development tax pools to offset current taxes payable 
the fiscal year chemdex tax benefit was recorded because there is no longer uncertainty as to the ability of chemdex to use non operating losses following the sale of the vet labs assets for a gain subsequent to the end of fiscal year on march   the company sold its finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business to sparhawk 
the sale included substantially all of the assets of vet labs and its ownership interest in the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   the company had cash of  compared to cash of  at january  in fiscal year the company generated cash of  from its operating activities  compared to  for fiscal year although there was a decrease in the net loss in fiscal year  this decrease resulted from the deferred tax recovery  which is a non cash item 
in fiscal year  there were significant non cash expenses relating to deferred income taxes and the writedown of loan to sparhawk  which were not incurred in fiscal year depreciation and amortization continues to be a large non cash expense of the company 
in fiscal year  the company generated cash of  from its operating activities 
the company maintained  of working capital and a current ratio of to as of january   compared to  and to as of january   and  and to as of january  management expects the primary source of its future capital needs to be a combination of company earnings  borrowings and the proceeds from the sale of the vet labs assets 
the company  at present  does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  although management intends to continue the plant refurbishment process at dextran products in toronto 
the company believes that based upon the current levels of revenues and spending  and taking into account the effect of the sale of the vet labs assets on the operating results of chemdex  its existing working capital resources will be sufficient to support continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
at january   the company had accounts receivable  including amounts classified as assets subject to sale agreement  of  and inventory of  compared to  and  respectively  at january  the decrease in accounts receivable was due to timing of collections at year end 
the increase in inventory levels was due to stocking of the new products at chemdex 
at january   the company had accounts receivable of  and inventory of  the increase in accounts receivable from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to the timing of collections at year end discussed above  while the increase in inventory levels was due to the stocking of additional finished goods for shipment to a particular customer and the stocking of a new product at chemdex 
at january   the company had accounts payable  including amounts included in liabilities subject to sale agreement  of  compared to  at january  the decrease in accounts payable was due to timing of supplier payments 
at january   the company had accounts payable of  with the increase between fiscal year and fiscal year due primarily to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory discussed above 
during fiscal year  capital expenditures totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the majority of the capital expenditures were for production equipment at the dextran products plant in toronto in these fiscal years 
management intends to continue its plant refurbishment and expansion plan in fiscal year  and expects capital expenditures to increase in that period 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss of the company is entirely attributable to the currency translation adjustment of dextran products 
dextran products functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this currency translation adjustment arises from the translation of dextran products financial statements to us dollars 
dextran products has a cdn 
 us  line of credit  of which cdn 
 us  was utilized at january  this line of credit was not utilized at january  this line of credit bears interest at the canadian banks prime lending rate plus  
this indebtedness is collateralized by a general security agreement over the company s assets and a collateral mortgage of cdn 
 on the dextran products building in toronto 
the joint venture had a  line of credit to fund operations  none of which was utilized at january  or as a result of the march  disposition of the vet labs assets  the joint venture line of credit is no longer be available to the company 
chemdex entered into one new long term debt obligation on september   which related to the redemption of the minority interest in chemdex 
the redemption amount was  which is to be paid in equal monthly installments of  commencing on the redemption date 
since this installment contract is non interest bearing  it has been discounted using a discount rate of 
the present value of this installment contract is  which has been recorded as long term debt 
the significant decrease in long term debt from fiscal year to fiscal year is due to continuing payments by the company  and the full repayment of the term loan by the joint venture 
all long term debt is due in the next two years 
the company entered into one new capital lease obligation at dextran products during fiscal year  for a piece of production equipment 
capital lease obligations are due over the next three years 
no changes in accounting principles or their application have been implemented in the reporting period that would have a material effect on reported income 
changes in the relative values of the canadian dollar and the united states dollar occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company does not believe that the impact of inflation and changing prices has had a material effect on its operations or financial results at any time in the last three years

risk factors the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
the company s product development efforts may be reduced or discontinued due to difficulties or delays in clinical trials 
to achieve sustained profitability  the company must  alone or with corporate partners and collaborators  successfully research  develop and commercialize identified technologies or product candidates 
current developmental product candidates are in various stages of clinical and pre clinical development and will require significant further funding  research  development  preclinical and or clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization testing  and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative or novel technologies 
these products are also rigorously regulated by the us federal government  particularly the fda  and by comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries 
specifically  each of the following results is possible with respect to any one of the company s developmental product candidates that the company will not be able to maintain its current research and development schedules  that the company will not be able to enter into human clinical trials because of scientific  governmental or financial reasons  or that it will encounter problems in clinical trials that will cause a delay or suspension of the development of the product candidate  that the developmental product will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  that government regulations will delay or prevent the product s marketing for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon the company s activities  that the fda or other regulatory agencies will not approve the product or the process by which the product is manufactured  or will not do so on a timely basis  and or that the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations and policies may be instituted  which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the product 
if any of the risks set forth above occurs  the company may not be able to successfully develop its identified developmental product candidates 
the company s developmental product commercialization efforts may not be successful 
it is possible that  for reasons including  but not limited to those set forth below  the company may be unable to commercialize or receive royalties from the sale of any given developmental product  even if it is shown to be effective  if the product is uneconomical or if the market for the product does not develop or diminishes  the company is not able to enter into arrangements or collaborations to commercialize and or market the product  the product is not eligible for third party reimbursement from government or private insurers  others hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from commercializing the product  others have brought to market similar or superior products  others have superior resources to market similar products or technologies  government regulation imposes limitations on the indicated uses of the product  or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product results in added restrictions on the product or results in the product being withdrawn from the market  and or the product has undesirable or unintended side effects that prevent or limit its commercial use 
the company depends on partnerships with third parties for the development and commercialization of its products 
the company s strategy for development and commercialization of its products is to rely on licensing agreements with third party partners 
as a result  the ability of the company to commercialize future products is dependent upon the success of third parties in performing clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and successfully marketing its products 
there can be no assurance that such third party collaborations will be successful 
if any of the company s current research and development partnerships are discontinued  it may not be able to find others to develop and commercialize its current product candidates 
the company does not currently have agreements with third parties to market its developmental products 
the commercialization of any of the company s developmental products that receive fda approval will depend upon the company s ability to enter into agreements with companies that have sales and marketing capabilities 
the company currently intends to sell its products in the united states and internationally in collaboration with one or more marketing partners 
the company may not be able to enter into any such collaboration to market its developmental products in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the company may be unable to commercialize its products if it is unable to protect its proprietary rights  and may be liable for significant costs and damages if it faces a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
in the absence of patent and trade secret protection  competitors may adversely affect the company s business by independently developing and marketing substantially equivalent or superior products  possibly at lower prices 
the company could also incur substantial costs in litigation and suffer diversion of attention of technical and management personnel if it is required to defend intellectual property infringement suits brought by third parties  with or without merit  or if required to initiate litigation against others to protect or assert intellectual property rights 
moreover  any such litigation may not be resolved in favor of the company 
the company has received various patents covering the uses of its developmental products 
however  the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions  and recently has been the subject of much litigation 
any patents the company has obtained  or may obtain in the future  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
to date  no consistent policy has been developed by the united states patent and trademark office regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and because publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  the company cannot be certain that it and its licensors are the first creators of inventions covered by any licensed patent applications or patents or that the company or such licensors are the first to file 
the united states patent and trademark office may commence interference proceedings involving patents or patent applications  in which the question of first inventorship is contested 
accordingly  the patents owned by or licensed to the company may not be valid or may not afford the company protection against competitors with similar intellectual property 
it is also possible that the company s patents may infringe on patents or other rights owned by others  licenses to which may not be available to the company 
the company may have to alter its products or processes  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities altogether because of patent rights of third parties 
in addition to the products for which the company has patents or have filed patent applications  the company relies upon unpatented proprietary technology and may not be able to meaningfully protect its rights with regard to that unpatented proprietary technology 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  applied on a consistent basis 
the critical accounting policies include the use of estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts  the useful lives of assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the company s accounting policies with respect to the joint venture and its disposition are also discussed below 
management is required to make estimates and assumptions  in preparing the consolidated financial statements  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
the actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates made by management include the calculation of reserves for uncollectible accounts  inventory allowances  useful lives of long lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition all revenue is from sales of bulk and finished dosage manufactured products and is recognized when title and risk of ownership of products pass to the customer 
title and risk of ownership pass to the customer pursuant to the applicable sales contract  either upon shipment of product or upon receipt by the customer 
since returns are rare and generally not accepted  management has not made provision for returns 
in addition  product sold in bulk quantities is tested  prior to release for shipment  to ensure that it meets customer specifications  and in many cases  customers receive samples for their own testing 
approval is obtained from the customer prior to shipping 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by each reporting unit on a specific item basis 
management reviews the credit worthiness of individual customers and past payment history to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
since the majority of sales at dextran products are export  dextran products maintains credit insurance through a crown corporation for the majority of its customers receivables 
long lived assets long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation or amortization computed using the straight line method based on their estimated useful lives ranging from three to fifteen years 
useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to the company s cash flows 
a significant change in estimated useful lives could have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  including buildings  equipment and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on the company s ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long lived assets as well as other fair value determinations 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where there is uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of the future tax deduction 
there has not been a consistent history of profitability at chemdex  therefore there is uncertainty regarding whether there will be adequate future profits realized to use the us tax loss deductions 
dextran products has incurred capital losses  which are only deductible against capital gains 
it is not certain that dextran products will realize capital gains in the future to use these canadian capital loss deductions 
the joint venture in  vet labs and sparhawk entered into the joint venture for the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceutical products 
vet labs and sparhawk each owned of the joint venture during its operation

the policy committee consisted of five members  three of which are selected by vet labs and two of which are selected by sparhawk 
decisions of the policy committee required a simple majority vote 
because the company controlled the operating  financing and investing decisions of the joint venture through vet labs control of the policy committee  it consolidated the joint venture s assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in the company s financial statements 
the company has funded the joint venture s cumulative losses since and  accordingly  has recorded of these losses in the consolidated financial statements

in connection with the sale  the litigation involving the joint venture  sparhawk laboratories  inc v 
veterinary laboratories  inc  et al  case no 
cv  county of johnson  state of kansas  was settled  and a motion of approval of settlement and stipulation of dismissal with prejudice was filed with the court on march  the assets and liabilities of vet labs and the joint venture at january  and that are subject to the asset purchase agreement have been reclassified to assets and liabilities subject to sale agreement 
all liabilities subject to sale agreement were current liabilities at both january  and all assets subject to sale agreement at january  were considered current assets because the sale closed less than two months after fiscal year end 
at january   long lived assets are presented as non current because the disposal date was more than one year from the date of sale of the assets 
effective january   depreciation and amortization of the long lived assets ceased 
a significant gain will be recorded by the company upon the disposal of the vet labs assets

a rise in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar also results in a decrease in gross margins and net income of dextran products 
dextran products also experiences a foreign exchange loss when the canadian dollar rises in relation to the united states dollar due to this net asset exposure 
similarly  a decline in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar results in a foreign exchange gain and increased gross margins and net income at dextran products 
management monitors currency fluctuations to ensure that an acceptable margin level at dextran products is maintained 
management has the ability  to some extent  to adjust sales prices to maintain an acceptable margin level
