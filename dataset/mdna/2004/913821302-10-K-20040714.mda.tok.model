a discussion and analysis of the hong kong joint venture s operational results for these periods is presented below under the heading hong kong joint venture 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended march   and sales 
in fiscal year  our net sales increased by   from  in fiscal to  in fiscal our focus on marketing to retailers  including the wholesale distribution trades  generated the majority of the increase 
we anticipate continued revenue growth in all our markets 
in fiscal year  sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal our focus on marketing to the electrical distribution trade through our usi electric subsidiary generated an increase in sales to this market of approximately  from approximately  in to approximately  in 
we also experienced an increase of approximately  in sales to the company s retail and wholesale distribution customers over the prior year 
cost of sales and gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales or gross margin in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in gross profit for each year resulted from increased productivity and efficiency 
our strategy is to increase gross margins by increasing sales 
since fixed costs will not increase at the same rate as sales  the gross margin percentage as a percent of sales will increase as sales increase 
management does not anticipate a near term need to increase fixed costs 
expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher commission and freight costs associated with our higher sales  higher legal costs associated with defending patent and other litigation and implementing our expansion in retail marketing 
these increases were partially offset by a net gain of  from the sale of a acre parcel of land during the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately   from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales was due to higher sales volume and variable costs which did not increase at the same rate as sales 
the higher expenses were due to increased sales commissions and freight  and higher legal costs partly associated with defending the suits described under item  legal proceedings

interest expense for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates and lower levels of debts 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates 
income taxes 
we did not make any provision for federal income taxes in each of the  and fiscal years  due to our operating loss carryforward for income tax purposes 
however  we made a provision of  for state income taxes for fiscal year a valuation allowance has been established and  accordingly  no benefit has been recognized for the tax benefit of our net operating losses or other deferred tax assets 
net income

this increase in net income resulted from both higher hong kong joint venture earnings and higher gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses as described above

this increase in net income resulted from both higher hong kong joint venture earnings and higher gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses as described above 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are currently met by funds generated from operations and from our factoring agreement  which supplies both short term borrowings and letters of credit to finance foreign inventory purchases 
the maximum we may borrow under this agreement is  however  based on specified percentages of our accounts receivable and inventory and letter of credit commitments  at march   our maximum borrowing amount was limited to  all of which was available under this agreement as of march  the outstanding principal balance under this agreement is payable upon demand 
the interest rate on the factoring agreement  on the uncollected factored accounts receivable and any additional borrowings is equal to in excess of the prime rate of interest charged by the factor which  as of march   resulted in a rate 
the borrowings are collateralized by all our accounts receivable and inventory 
during the year ended march   working capital computed as the excess of current assets over current liabilities increased by  from  on march   to  on march  our operating activities used cash of  for the year ended march  for the fiscal year ended march   operating activities used cash of  this increase of  was primarily due to higher levels of accounts receivable and undistributed joint venture earnings primarily offset by higher net income

in fiscal year  sales of the hong kong joint venture were  compared to  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
net income was  for fiscal year compared to net income of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in the current fiscal year is primarily attributable to lower gross margins due to competition and higher manufacturing costs 
the increase in income for the year ended march  was due primarily to higher sales  including to unrelated customers ie  other than the company 
gross margins of the hong kong joint venture for fiscal decreased to from in the prior fiscal year 
the primary reason for this decrease was that lower gross margins due to competition and higher costs 
for fiscal  the hong kong joint venture s gross margin increased to from during fiscal the primary reason for this increase was that the variable costs in cost of goods sold did not increase at the same rate as sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses each year was due partially to higher costs as well as higher sales volume

cash needs of the hong kong joint venture are currently met by funds generated from operations 
during fiscal year  working capital decreased by  from  on march  to  on march  we are not in a position to quantify any funds which may be available to the hong kong joint venture from any ipo proceeds  if an ipo by the hong kong joint venture is completed as previously discussed 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents  as of march   our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations    total    critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement included as part of this document 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application on these and other accounting policies see note a to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements issued by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we establishe allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts based upon historical experience 
inventories are valued at the lower of market or cost 
cost is determined on the first in first out method 
we have recorded a reserve for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management reviews the reserve quarterly 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
we have provided a valuation allowance on future tax benefits such as foreign tax credits  foreign net operating losses  capital losses and net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses and losses in recent years 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
as a result of management s assessment  we established a full valuation allowance for its remaining net deferred tax assets at march  we are subject to lawsuits and other claims  related to patents and other matters 
management is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies existing accounting for whether interest entities should be consolidated in financial statements based upon the investees ability to finance its activities without additional financial support and whether investors possess characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
fin applies to years or interim periods beginning after june  with certain disclosure provisions required for financial statements issued after january  we are currently evaluating the applicability of fin to our investments in our hong kong joint venture and have complied with the disclosure provisions of fin in these financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal financial instrument is our factoring agreement which provides for interest at the factor s prime rate at march  plus 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by us under our factoring agreement 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
at march   we had no aggregate principal outstanding under the facility 
if principal amounts outstanding under our factoring agreement remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  we would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest in that year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
