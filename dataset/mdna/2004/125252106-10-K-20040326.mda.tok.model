item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company formulates  manufactures and sells chemically complex  transferable multi layer coatings for use in many diversified markets such as furniture and building products  pharmaceutical products  transaction cards  including credit cards  debit cards  atm cards and access cards  intaglio printing and on sophisticated embossable coatings for holographic packaging and authentication seals 
the company also has developed a sophisticated fulfillment system 
during the period from to  the company has experienced  and expects to continue experiencing  shifts in the relative sales and growth of its various products 
the company believes that such shifts are in the ordinary course of business and are indicative of its focus on specific niche markets 
the strength of european currencies in caused an increase in sales of million compared to holographic products net sales increased from million in to in  primarily due to growth in authentication sales and consumer products packaging 
printed products net sales declined from million in to million in this decline in net sales is primarily due to the decline in the manufactured housing market  and competition from low priced imports from asia 
pharmaceutical products net sales increased from million in to million in  primarily due to the growth of european sales and an aging population 
security products net sales decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a decline in magnetic stripe sales and signature panels due to lower selling prices as a result of increased competition in this market  which was offset by the company s entry into the gift card business 
specialty pigmented and simulated metal products net sales decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the company exiting low margin business 
in october  a major competitor in printed woodgrain patterns announced it was not going to service its united states market as of february   and did in fact exit the market at this time 
as a result  the company anticipates a substantial sales increase in this product line 
due to the anticipated increase in domestic production  the company is in the process of transferring production of printed woodgrain products sold in europe to its german operations to create additional domestic capacity  maximize european production and  as part of a business strategy  to utilize our tax net operating loss carryforward in germany 
the company anticipates mid single digit growth in its pharmaceutical products due to the aging of the world population  and the projected increase in demand for medical services 
the evolving gift card market appears to be favoring companies that can perform the backroom bookkeeping  which the company is not currently involved in  as well as produce the cards themselves  and such movement will hold back growth in this product line 
the company s cost of sales reflects the application of all direct product costs and direct labor  quality control  shipping and receiving  maintenance  process engineering and plant management and excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately 
selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily composed of sales representatives salaries and related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  advertising costs and management compensation

security products mag stripe  signature panels  tipping products for credit cards  intaglio printed documents and gift cards net sales decreased to from million 
this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in volume of gift card business associated with a customer that was working off excess inventory it purchased last year 
pharmaceutical product net sales increased to from million  primarily as a result of sales to existing european customers in the first half of net sales of specialty pigmented and simulated metal products increased to from million  primarily due to the appreciation of the euro  somewhat offset by a decrease in domestic sales due to the company exiting lower margin business 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  increased to from million for the year ended december  higher scrap domestically  coupled with the strength of the euro in converting european manufacturing costs into us dollars and a decrease in the gift card business sales volume which has a lower percent cost as the material is provided by the customer  resulted in the increased costs 
in addition  the company incurred costs necessary to retain trained production people in anticipation of an increase in its printed woodgrain patterned products because of a major competitor exiting the market 
the company also incurred costs in hiring and training new printed woodgrain patterns production personnel in the mid fourth quarter lastly  in  the company benefited from volume purchases which were not as high in the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was due to the reasons noted above

security products mag stripe  signature panels  tipping products for credit cards  intaglio printed documents and gift cards net sales increased to million from million 
this increase is due primarily to the company s entry into the gift card market  plus increased magnetic stripe sales due to new product offerings  offset by lower sales of security documents to a foreign government 
pharmaceutical product net sales decreased to million  from million primarily as a result of lower sales in latin and south america 
net sales of specialty pigmented and simulated metal products decreased to million from million  primarily due to the disruption in servicing the company s european customers due to the february backfire on a coating press in the company s german operations that constrained capacity during the first three quarters of this press had five of the six stations up and running on april  the sixth station became operable the middle of june  but did not reach full efficiency until october during the periods in which these stations were inoperable  many products had to be routed to alternative machines for production  resulting in strained capacity  lower production  and  consequently lower sales 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in costs is primarily a result of lower material cost percentage on similar net sales and insurance interruption proceeds in the amount of million due to the backfire on the coating press in germany  which approximated lost margins on sales

significant accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described on pages and  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include an assessment of the realization of future tax benefits  inventory reserves and the allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations  as well as net operating losses  tax credit and other carryforwards 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this evaluation during  the company considered all available positive and negative evidence  including past results in the us and germany  the existence of losses in germany since the acquisition of the cfc oeser business  and the company s forecast of future taxable income 
the forecast of future taxable income in germany exceeds the company s historical performance and reflects the company s best assumptions about the likely impact of several major events and other items that are expected to improve the german operation s future profitability  including o the movement of production of printed woodgrain products from us operations to german operations 
o realization of anticipated cost savings for actions taken which include employee terminations  reductions in material procurement prices  and the closing of the uk finishing and warehouse operations 
o additional sales volume from new customers as a result of a printed woodgrain competitor which exited the us market 
the foreign net operating loss carry forwards nol s totaling million euros at december  relate to taxable losses in germany and may be carried forward to offset future taxable income in germany 
at present  the unused nol s have no expiration dates 
in december  new german tax regulations with regards to nol s were approved and became effective january  the new regulations limit the annual utilization of the nol carryforward to one million euros of taxable income and of the amount of taxable income in excess of one million euros 
during the third quarter of  the company developed a business strategy to shift production of certain printed woodgrain products sold in europe to its german operations 
this has the benefit of creating capacity domestically to serve the anticipated increase in printed woodgrain patterns caused by the major competitor announcing its exiting of the united states market 
in determining the amount of future taxable income  a number of additional assumptions were made  including the amount of us and german pre tax operating income 
while these assumptions require significant judgment  they are consistent with the plans and estimates the company is using to manage the underlying business 
the company believes that it is more likely than not to recover its net deferred tax asset of million including million related to the german nol carryforward at december  however  recovery is dependent on the achievement of forecasted future taxable income 
the company will review its forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve its business plan targets  particularly in germany  may change its assessment regarding the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset and would result in the need to record a valuation allowance which would result in additional income tax expense  a reduction in stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on the company s earnings 
further  changes to the german tax laws could also affect the level of the company s deferred tax assets 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo basis 
inventory cost includes cost of raw material  labor and overhead 
provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory requires the company to make judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill and holographic base coat and worldwide holographic rights 
these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of to years and assume no residual value 
beginning january   the company no longer amortizes goodwill see footnote to the financial statements and reviews it for impairment on an annual basis 
depreciation 
property and equipment are amortized using the straight line method over useful lives that range from three to years 
a significant portion of fixed assets are machinery and manufacturing equipment that are depreciated over to year lives and assume no residual value 
revenue recognition 
under the terms of its sales agreements with customers  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  generally upon product shipment based upon shipping terms  price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
for certain transactions  which are not material  revenue is recognized upon completion of manufacturing  or upon use by the customer 
warranty costs 
certain return privileges exist for the possibility of sub standard goods 
customers have a right to inspect goods within days of receipt 
beginning in early  the company expanded the warranty period to days for selected printed patterns  to meet changes in customer expectations 
the company records an estimated provision for possible returns  using historical experience at the time revenue is recognized 
historically  returns have been less than of net sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of working capital have been net cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings under various loan agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant portion of cash flow from operations is generated by income from operations and depreciation and amortization expense 
at december  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company purchased the land and building adjacent to the west of the company s chicago heights  illinois facility for million on february  the company financed the purchase with borrowings under its revolving loan 
the company is pursuing interest favorable financing which it anticipates closing mid year in addition  the company anticipates capital expenditures in of approximately million to be funded with cash flows generated by operations and available lines of credit 
credit arrangements 
the company and its subsidiaries have a combination of revolving and term credit arrangements collectively the credit agreements for total borrowings of million 
the credit agreements also provide for  in the form of standby letters of credit to guarantee the foreign borrowing 
at december  outstanding borrowings consisted of revolving borrowings domestic  europe  mortgage note payable  face amount of  bearing interest fixed at at december  see interest rate swap discussion below  payable in monthly principal and interest of  with a final payment of million on november   secured by related property  term loan payable  face amount of  bearing interest at fixed at december  see interest rate swap discussion below  payable in monthly principal and interest payments of  due on february   secured by assets of the us operations us  equipment note payable  face amount of   drawn at december   bearing interest at prime at december   payable in monthly principal installments of  balance due on december   secured by two oxidizers  industrial revenue bond  face amount of  bearing interest at a floating weekly rate and payable monthly at december   such rate capped at  requiring annual principal payments of  through with the final balance due on june   secured by a standby letter of credit  convertible subordinated note payable  face amount of  bearing interest at  payable in nine annual principal payments of  through september  term loan payable  face amount of  euro  bearing interest at  payable monthly  requiring quarterly principal installments of  euro  final balance due april  secured by standby letter of credit  term loan payable  face amount of  euro  bearing interest at  requiring quarterly principal installments of  euro  interest payable quarterly  this loan is due march  and the company is in the process of renewing  secured by standby letter of credit  two local european bank accommodation loans  face amount  euro  bearing interest at  payable monthly  maturing february  which the company expects to rollover in  the year end euro exchange rate used to convert euro denominated debt to us dollars was at december  the company s revolving credit arrangements provide for maximum borrowings  based upon eligible inventory and receivables balances  of approximately million million euros and us million 
amounts available under these arrangements as of december  were million 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreements bear interest ranging from prime to over libor 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding domestic revolving borrowings was and on the european revolving loans 
the revolving credit arrangements expire at various dates beginning in through under the domestic credit line  the company is required to pay an annual fee for the unused portion at an amount equal to 
times the daily average of the unused portion 
on january   the company s domestic financing agreements  which provide for revolving credits  term loans and a mortgage  were extended 
the company s main revolving loan was renewed through april  the term loans and mortgage were extended to november  a prepayment penalty of  was rolled into the principal of the term loan  and the monthly principal payments and interest were changed to  and the final balloon payment of  the company has the ability under its domestic financing agreements to fix its rate of interest at libor plus  and on april   the company executed two interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates on the company s us term loans 
the company entered into these agreements to reduce the risk of adverse changes in variable interest rates 
the notional amounts were  with a fixed rate of  and  with a fixed rate of on april  the swap agreements terminate on january  changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  the company has recorded these derivative instruments and the associated assets or liabilities at their fair values with the related gains or losses recorded as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the credit agreements contain covenants which  among other things  restrict new indebtedness and dividend declarations and include a requirement of a minimum of  of pretax income and requires the company to maintain a compensating balance and contain a subjective acceleration clause 
the borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the combined debt agreement prohibits the payment of dividends 
the subordinated convertible note the note is convertible  in whole or in part  at the option of the holder into common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share 
the note has been callable  since september   at premiums starting at of face value and declining thereafter 
in addition  the note is callable if the company s stock price exceeds of the conversion price for twenty consecutive days 
the company s stock price since the date of issuance of the debt has been below the conversion price and no beneficial conversion feature existed at the date of issuance 
accordingly  no portion of the proceeds from issuance was accounted for as attributable to the conversion feature 
the note agreement contains covenants that include certain financial tests  including restrictions on indebtedness 
the company believes it will continue to generate cash flow from operations and expects to be profitable in  primarily due to an increase in its sales of printed woodgrain patterns and holographic products 
the company will continue to consider other avenues to improve profitability such as further cost containment measures or other changes in operations including quick changeovers  longer run sizes and increased running speeds 
the company believes that the net cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the company s operations through additionally  the company historically has obtained financing on normal commercial terms to fund acquisitions and major equipment purchases  and anticipates it will be able to continue to do so in the future if opportunities or needs arise 
contractual cash obligations future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations  and non cancelable operating lease agreements are as follows and there after total revolver mortgage note payable term loan payable equipment note payable industrial revenue bond convertible subordinated note payable european term loans operating lease obligations total seasonality and impact of inflation historically  the company has experienced lower net sales levels during the fourth quarter and increased net sales levels during the following first quarter 
this has been primarily due to year end depletion of inventory levels by the company s customers and due to the holidays at the end of the year  as the company s customers have an increased number of holiday plant closings 
in addition  fourth quarter pharmaceutical product sales generally are lower as a result of the postponement of elective surgeries during holiday periods 
in previous years  sales of fourth quarter printed products for use in the ready to assemble furniture market have been generally greater than third quarter sales in each of the previous years 
also  the gift card business sales were much stronger in the third and fourth quarter of during  the gift card business did not have the same impact and the company does not expect the same proportional impact going forward due to the growth in holography and printed products 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or income to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future

special note on forward looking statements the company believes that certain statements contained in this report and in the future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s written and oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer that are not historical facts constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
the words and phrases looking ahead  is confident  should be  will  predicted  believe  plan  intend  estimates  likely  expect and anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and business environment which may affect the accuracy of forward looking statements and cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
as a result  in some future quarter the company s operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
many of the factors that will determine results of operations are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include o the effect of continuing unfavorable economic conditions on market growth trends in general and the impact on the company s customers  the demand for the company s products and services  and the company s ordinary sources of supply in particular  o risks inherent in international operations  including possible economic  political or monetary instability and its impact on the level and profitability of foreign sales  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to consummate its business strategy  including the unavailability of suitable acquisition candidates  or the company s inability to finance future acquisitions or successfully realize synergies and cost savings from the integration of acquired businesses  o changes in the costs and availability of raw materials and the company s ability to adjust selling prices to reflect those changes  o the company s reliance on existing senior management and the impact of the loss of any of those persons or its inability to continue to identify  hire and retain qualified management personnel  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to develop and distribute new proprietary products to respond to market needs in a timely manner and the company s ability to continue to protect its proprietary product information and technology  o the company s ability to continue to successfully identify and implement productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives  o the company s reliance on a small number of significant customers  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to continue to compete effectively with other producers of specialty transferable coatings and producers of alternative products with greater financial and management resources  o control of the company by a principal stockholder  and o the effects of acts of terrorism and armed conflicts on the company s operations  demands for products and sources of supply 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the company to predict all such risk factors  nor can the company assess the impacts of all such risk factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the company has no obligation to revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after february  or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated events 
investors should also be aware that while the company does  from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against the company s policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  investors should not assume that the company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
thus  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not the company s responsibility 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments to address currency or commodity pricing risks 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments held by the company for which it is practicable to estimate that value 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments 
the estimated fair value of accounts receivable approximated its carrying value at december  and based upon analysis of their collectability and net realizable value 
the estimated fair value of the company s long term debt approximated its carrying value at december  and december   based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instrument 
the company minimizes its exposure to the impact of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in situations for certain sales for products sold in europe but manufactured in the us through the movement of production of those products to europe 
there are no other activities of the company where management believes exchange rates have a material impact with respect to the underlying transactions 
beginning in january  the company renewed its main loan agreements 
the company s us term loans were renewed at a floating prime rate of interest with a one time option to a fixed rate of interest which was fixed april  see note to the financial statement beginning on page for more details 
on april   the company executed two interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates on the company s us term loans 
the company entered into these agreements to reduce the risk of adverse changes in variable interest rates 
the notional amounts were  with a fixed rate of  and  with a fixed rate of on april  the swap agreements terminate on january  changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  the company has recorded these derivative instruments and the associated assets or liabilities at their fair values with the related gains or losses recorded as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest expense the company s exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the composition of its debt instruments which consist of fixed and variable rate instruments 
certain variable rate debt instruments can also be converted to a fixed rate should interest rates rise in the future 
euro conversion member countries of the european union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
since january   the new euro denominated notes and coins are in circulation and legacy currencies have been withdrawn from circulation
