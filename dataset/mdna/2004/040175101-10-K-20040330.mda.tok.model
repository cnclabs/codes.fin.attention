item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of  and it is the company s intention that such statements be protected by the safe harbor created thereby 
examples of such forward looking statements include statements regarding future revenues  expenses  losses and cash flows  research and development activities and sales and marketing initiatives such as our plan to concentrate our efforts in those areas such as building our core consumables business  possible future acquisitions  our plans to discontinue non performing consumable products and certain legacy instrument products  the anticipated effects of our recent restructuring program and related accruals  values of our assets and liabilities over their remaining useful lives and our testing for impairment of goodwill  and our expectations as to the duration of our negative cash flows from operations and the sufficiency of existing cash reserves for the next months 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including the risk that a decline in the economy generally or the market for our products will adversely affect our business  the risk that the market for our products and services does not develop as anticipated  the risk that we are unable to successfully integrate the product and service offerings of the companies we recently acquired and successfully capitalize on anticipated synergies and growth opportunities  and the risk that our restructuring programs do not proceed as planned and that we incur unexpected expenses in connection with the implementation thereof 
for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties related to our business see the discussion set forth herein under factors that may affect our future results 
overview argonaut develops innovative products designed to help pharmaceutical and other chemists engaged in the discovery and development of new chemical entities increase their productivity and reduce their operating costs without compromising the scientific integrity of their research 
our products are designed to enable chemists to increase their productivity  reduce their operating costs through automation and process simplification  and cost effectively explore the increasing number of drug targets available for drug development 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our chemistry consumable products  instrumentation products and services 
we commenced commercial shipment of our first generation instrument in  the quest product line in  the trident product line in and the surveyor and the endeavor product lines in revenue from sales of our instrument products is recognized when delivery and installation of the product is complete 
we also derive revenues from the sale of reagents and other instrument related consumables  as well as revenues derived from products and integration services and the sale of instruments and consumables products of jones chromatography limited jones group  which we acquired on february  our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and general and administrative costs associated with our operations  and our sales and marketing organization 
on july   the company announced the sale of its hplc product line to the grace vydac business unit of wr grace co 
the sale principally included the genesis and apex tm brands of hplc columns inventory as well as hplc related capital assets and trademarks 
the sale of these assets enables the company to focus r d and sales and marketing efforts on core product areas providing consumable and instrument products to the critical areas of drug development 
the pretax gain on the sale of net assets was approximately  since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
critical accounting policies and management s estimates we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of investments  inventory adjustments  warranty liabilities  restructuring charge  purchase accounting  impairment of long lived assets  income tax and stock compensation to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition in may  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf finalized criteria governing how to identify whether goods or services  or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately and issued eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into beginning after july  the effect of adopting eitf issue no 
did not and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s are considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item s has value on a standalone basis  if there is objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
there are standard products offered by argonaut where consideration of eitf is applicable 
generally  these standard situations are transacted as separate line items in the sales order purchase order and are priced separately 
in these normal situations  the multiple items are priced and sold separately  clearly have standalone value to the customer as evidenced by history of sales to other customers on a standalone basis  and the revenue recognition is triggered upon shipment of the line item to the customer 
for each arrangement  we determine whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  collectibility is reasonably assured and fees are fixed or determinable 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until all of the criteria are met 
product revenue revenue related to product sales with no future obligation is recognized upon shipment when the recognition criteria have been met 
for those products where we have obligations to provide installation services  revenue is recognized upon installation when all other recognition criteria have been met 
sales that require customer acceptance are not recognized as revenue until the acceptance and all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
services revenue maintenance contract revenue  including revenue for extended warranties  is recognized ratably over the contractual term  training  contract research and development and other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the composition of our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering our customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents investments investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out cost method or market value 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon a detailed assessment at each balance sheet date which reviews  among other factors  the forecasted demand and plans to sell our inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventory is also considered in establishing its valuation  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
based on this analysis  we reduce the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we also sell warranty extensions and the related revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the extension 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
restructuring during fiscal years and  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our restructuring program 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs  related abandonment of excess equipment  the abandonment of excess leased facilities  and other related charges 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
purchase accounting we accounted for the acquisitions of camile products  llc  now argonaut technologies systems  inc atsi and the jones group under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities were based on third party estimates and valuations 
the remaining values were based on our judgments and estimates  and accordingly  the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 

table of contents goodwill and other purchased intangibles goodwill and other purchased intangible assets have resulted from the acquisition of atsi and the jones group 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized subsequent to the company s adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
all goodwill and intangible assets have been assigned to one of two reporting units 
the argonaut agnt legacy reporting unit consists primarily of goodwill and intangible assets related to the company s acquisition of atsi 
the jones group reporting unit consists of goodwill and intangible assets deriving from the company s acquisition of jones chromatography  ltd 
the company performs the annual test for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives as prescribed by sfas during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment by reporting unit  if any 
during the third quarter ended september  the company performed an interim test for goodwill impairment in light of lower than expected third quarter revenue 
based on the discounted cash flows of the agnt legacy reporting unit  the company recognized an impairment charge of million relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with atsi 
approximately   of the impairment charge was related to goodwill associated with atsi  and the remainder was related to completed technology assets associated with the acquisition of atsi 
the company performed the annual test for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives as prescribed by sfas during the fourth quarter of fiscal  determining that no further impairment was indicated 
the company determined the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives based on a present value analysis of the discounted future cash flows 
income tax we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
stock compensation deferred stock compensation is the difference between the exercise price of the options and the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
for these purposes the fair value was determined based on the business factors underlying the value of our common stock on the date of grant viewed in light of our initial public offering in july and the anticipated initial public offering price per share 
the deferred stock compensation was recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options  generally four years  using the graded vesting method 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in the year ended december  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees 
we have recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately   and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of approximately  to be amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
we also recorded stock compensation of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  in connection with options granted to consultants 
these options are periodically re measured as they vest  in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services

other income expenses interest and other income of million for the year ended december  was essentially flat as compared to million for the same period in interest and other expense was  for the period ended december  compared to  in the same period in on july   the company announced the sale of its hplc product line to the grace vydac business unit of wr grace co 
the sale principally included the genesis and apex brands of hplc columns inventory as well as hplc related capital assets and trademarks 
the sale of these assets enables the company to focus r d and sales and marketing efforts on core product areas providing consumable and instrument products to the critical areas of drug development 
the pretax gain on the sale of net assets was approximately  for the period ended december  provision for income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire on various dates between and utilization of our net operating loss may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately  to record the uk corporate tax liability of jones group for the year ended december  as compared to  recorded for the same period in the increase is due to the combination of higher uk net income and tax

the duration of the stock repurchase program is open ended 
the timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this program will depend on market conditions  corporate and regulatory considerations  and will be funded from available working capital 
through december   the company had repurchased  shares of outstanding common stock at an average purchase price per share of 
the company expects to have negative cash flows from operations through the fourth quarter of we may also use cash resources and raise additional funds to fund additional collaborative or strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the availability of other financing on acceptable terms 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next months 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate  our operations 
we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative or strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products that we might otherwise seek to retain

we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we recorded net losses of million for the twelve month period ended december  we expect to continue to incur operating and net losses through and we may never generate positive cash flows 

table of contents to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our products 
funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity  the issuance of those securities will result in dilution to our stockholders 
if our products do not become widely used in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries  it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical organizations have historically performed chemistry development using traditional laboratory methods 
to date  our products have not been widely adopted by these industries 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon the adoption of these products as a method to develop chemical compounds for these industries 
in order to be successful  our products must meet the performance and pricing requirements for chemistry development within the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective customers that our products are a cost effective alternative to traditional methods and other technologies that may be introduced for chemistry development 
convince prospective customers that our products provide the same or enhanced quality and accuracy as compared with traditional methods and other new technologies that may be developed 
manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost 
install and service sufficient numbers of our instruments  particularly new instruments such as the advantage series tm process chemistry workstation 
if we cannot achieve these objectives  our products will not gain market acceptance 
we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
to meet these challenges  we have acquired complementary businesses and may choose to acquire others in the future 
we completed our acquisition of atsi in march and jones group in february during and  we made significant progress integrating the jones group business  however  we continue to have remaining integration activities and projects 
our failure to completely and successfully integrate this business may materially affect our business going forward 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any future acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  and may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
if we are unable to effectively integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies  our business may suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill or other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could negatively impact our operating results 
our available cash and securities may be used to buy or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 
due to volatile market conditions  the value of long lived assets maybe negatively impacted  which may result in future  additional impairment charges 
moreover  if we buy a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that are unknown at the time of acquisition 
our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products 
we continue to devote significant personnel and financial resources to research and development activities to develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing new products  and we may never realize any benefits from such research and development activities  which may not produce commercially viable products 
our ability to increase our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability is dependent upon 
table of contents our ability to successfully develop new and commercially viable products 
during the first half of  we launched a new product from the pfizer and ici consortium  the advantage series tm workstation  and this product is important to our ability to increase revenues in and beyond 
our failure to achieve our anticipated levels of revenues for this product will harm our ability to achieve our financial goals during our instrument products have lengthy sales cycles  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our ability to obtain customers for our instrument products depends  in significant part  upon the perception that our products can help accelerate efforts in chemical development 
the sale of many of our instrument products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by customers 
accordingly  the sales cycles of many of our instrument products are lengthy and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
our revenues could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  due to this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle 
a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our revenues decline or do not grow as we anticipate  we might not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses 
our failure to achieve our anticipated levels of revenues could significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not always a good indication of our future performance 
the capital spending policies of pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and other chemical research organizations have a significant effect on the demand for our instruments 
we market our products to and receive our revenues principally from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and other chemical research organizations  and the capital spending policies of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our instruments 
these policies are based on a wide variety of factors  including the resources available for purchasing research equipment  the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures 
in particular  the volatility of the public stock market for biotechnology and related companies has at certain times significantly impacted their ability to raise capital  which has directly affected their capital spending budgets 
in addition  continued consolidation within these industries will likely delay and may potentially reduce capital spending by pharmaceutical companies involved in such consolidations 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by life sciences companies could cause our revenues to decline and harm our profitability 
in order to be successful  we must recruit  retain and motivate key employees  and failure to do so could seriously harm us 
in order to be successful  we must recruit  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and sales positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel 
attracting and retaining qualified sales representatives is also critical to our future 
experienced management and technical  marketing and support personnel in the chemistry instrumentation and consumables industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  although current economic conditions have moderated this demand and competition for talent 
the loss of key employees could have a significant impact on our operations 
we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on argonaut s strategies and goals  which may be particularly difficult due to morale challenges posed by workforce reductions and general uncertainty 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and may result in the departure of existing employees  customers and or research collaborators 
it may take significant time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel 

table of contents our direct worldwide sales force and network of distributors may not be sufficient to successfully address the market for our products 
we sell a major portion of our products through our own sales force 
we may not be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force and continue to expand our network of distributors 
our failure to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force could negatively impact sales of our products  thus reducing our revenues and profitability 
because we outsource our instrument component  chemical intermediates and product manufacturing  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
we outsource most of the production of components of our instruments to vendors 
we also outsource significant quantities of our high volume chemical intermediates for our consumables products 
our reliance on our outside vendors exposes us to risks including the possibility that one or more of our vendors could terminate their services at any time without notice  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery  due to the difficulties in switching to alternative vendors  and the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternative sources of manufacturing services 
consequently  in the event that components from our suppliers or work performed by our vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason  our ability to produce and deliver our products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs would decline 
additionally  certain components are provided by a single source 
the effect of a disruption of delivery of those single source components could impact our ability to deliver product to our customers 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency and the us dollar 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency and us dollar exchange rates 
during  approximately of our net sales were exposed to foreign currency risk 
during the same period  approximately of our operating expenses were exposed to foreign currency risk 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we will monitor our exposure and may hedge against this and any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers 
due to the current slowdown in the economy  the credit risks relating to our customers have increased 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 
we have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations 
although these losses have not been significant  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions 
our business is subject to risks from international operations 
we conduct business globally 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future international business 
our business is subject to the effects of general global economic conditions  and particularly economic conditions in the united states and the united kingdom 
specifically  our business is subject to the effects of market conditions in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries 
in recent quarters  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and 
table of contents reduced capital spending in the united states  europe  and asia 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  and we may not have the resources necessary to successfully compete 
we compete with companies worldwide that are engaged in the development and production of similar products 
we face competition primarily from the following three sectors pharmaceutical companies developing their own instruments  companies marketing products based upon parallel synthesis and other non traditional technologies  such as mettler toledo ag and several smaller instrument and reagent companies  and companies marketing conventional products based on traditional chemistry methodologies  such as biotage ab  and isco  inc many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from organizations serving the life sciences industry that are developing or marketing competing products and technologies 
these organizations may develop products or technologies that are superior to our products or technologies in terms of performance  cost or both 
these organizations may offer price discounts or other concessions as a competitive tactic that we may not be in a position to match 
we will need to develop new applications for our products to remain competitive 
our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances of one or more of our current or future competitors 
in addition  the introduction or announcement of new products by us or by others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products  as customers evaluate these new products 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively against current technology as well as to respond effectively to technological advances 
if we infringe on or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others or we are unable to protect our own intellectual property rights our revenues could be harmed 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could affect our profitability 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from our business 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
we may not be able to obtain required licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could harm our ability to compete and result in a decline in our revenues 
our success may depend on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
any patents we own may not afford meaningful protection for our technology and products 
others may challenge our patents and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed  invalidated or rendered unenforceable 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents to us in the united states or foreign countries 
moreover  competitors may develop products similar to ours that are not covered by our patents 
we try to protect our non patented trade secrets by requiring our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques 
if we are unable to protect our 
table of contents proprietary information and techniques  our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market will be limited 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
we are listed on the nasdaq national market 
there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the nasdaq national market 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active 
if we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market  we may be de listed from trading on such market  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would likely be conducted through the nasdaq smallcap market  the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc our stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment could suffer a further decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and ranged in from a per share high of to a low of and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  including any directors  developments in the application or interpretation of new or existing accounting pronouncements and reporting obligations purchases or sales of our common stock  including any repurchases of our common stock under the existing or future stock repurchase program  and developments regarding our patents or other intellectual property or that of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq stock market s national market and smallcap market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life science companies 
these broad market and industry factors may negatively impact the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
sales of large numbers of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition  these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
all of the shares sold in our initial public offering are now freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act  except for any shares purchased by our affiliates  as defined in rule of the securities act 
the remaining shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities as defined in rule these 
table of contents shares may be sold in the future without registration under the securities act  to the extent permitted by rule or other exemptions under the securities act 
on march   we issued  shares of unregistered common stock in connection with the acquisition of atsi 
on february   we registered  shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 
on february   we issued  shares of unregistered common stock in connection with the acquisition of jones group 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
pursuant to our charter  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote of action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be deemed beneficial by our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we are also subject to certain provisions of delaware law that could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  and to make some activities more time consuming 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
recent accounting pronouncements in january of  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is considered to be the primary beneficiary in a vie 
primary beneficiary is the party subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to vie s created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  the company does not currently believe it has any investments in variable interest entities  therefore the adoption of fin did not and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in may of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which requires freestanding financial instruments such as mandatory redeemable shares  forward purchase contracts and written put options to be reported as liabilities by their issuers as well as related new disclosure requirements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and pre existing instruments as of the beginning 
table of contents of the first interim period that commences after june  the effect of adopting sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is related principally to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate investments may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates and floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers 
the principal notional amount with an expected maturity in the following year  weighted average interest rate  and average contractual maturity were as follows in millions december  december  principal notional amount with an expected maturity in following year weighted average interest rate average contractual maturity of investments days the company also has limited interest rate exposure related to the notes payable issued in consideration for the acquisition of the jones group 
the notes payable are denominated in british pound sterling in the amount of  million at origination and interest is payable to the note holders at an initial rate of per annum for the first twelve month period ending february   and subsequently at the rate equal to the published base rate of barclays bank plc on the date immediately preceding each quarterly interest period  less any fees and costs 
the notes payable mature at april  the company has limited interest rate risk on the notes payable due to the deposit of  million at origination in cash with barclays bank plc as collateral for the principal and interest on the notes payable 
the cash amounts held as collateral are represented as restricted cash in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and is invested in money market instruments to yield rates approximate to the interest rates due on the notes payable 
foreign currency risk as we have operations and sales outside of the united states  our financial results can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate 
our foreign operations and sales increased significantly in due primarily to the acquisition of the jones group 
with the jones group acquisition  approximately of our net sales are exposed to foreign currency risk  predominantly in the british pound  the euro  and the japanese yen 
approximately of our expenses are exposed to foreign currency risk
