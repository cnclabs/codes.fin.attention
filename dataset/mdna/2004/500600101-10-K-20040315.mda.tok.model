item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been audited in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investment valuations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibilty is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the price to the buyer charged for products delivered and services rendered and collectibility of the sales price 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
we typically provide customers with a twelve month warranty from the date of sale for our products 
if our judgment about recognizing revenue or our estimate of warranty claims are incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to amounts earned under milestones included in contracts  if such provisions exist 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues earned 
we bill unbilled receivables based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved are incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents investment valuation we periodically make equity investments 
we provide for allowances against these investments based upon the investments operating results  current economic trends and if it is a public company by comparing our carrying value against the company s publicly traded stock price 
we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the amortization or depreciation period may need to be changed 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such asset are less than its carrying value 
for assets that are to be held and used  impairment is measured based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held for sale  the asset is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
also defines when assets to be disposed of should be presented as discontinued operations 
if our estimates of anticipated future cash flows or market conditions were incorrect  additional impairment charges may be required 
results of operations we are a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our iii v and display products for use in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable consumer electronic applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
the year ending december  is referred to as  the year ended december  is referred to as  the year ended december  is referred to as  and the year ended december  is referred to as 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
product revenues consist of sales of our cyberdisplay products and our iii v products  principally gallium arsenide gaas hbt transistor wafers 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues in  million  or of total revenues in  and million  or of total revenues in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues for were million compared to million in for  iii v and cyberdisplay revenues were million and million  respectively versus million and million  respectively  for the increase in iii v revenues in compared to resulted from the introduction of our light emitting diode led products which offset a decrease in demand in from customers who buy our hbt transistor wafers for integration into components used in wireless handsets 
the decrease in cyberdisplay revenues in compared to resulted primarily from a decline in research and development contract revenue and a decline in the average selling price of our monochrome displays which was partially offset by higher unit sales 
we anticipate the average selling price of our monochrome displays and hbt transistor wafers to continue to decline 
we believe we have captured significant market share in the markets of the applications which currently use hbt transistor wafers and cyberdisplay products  principally wireless handsets and camcorders  and we will 
table of contents need to increase sales in other applications to generate revenue growth in these product lines 
in addition  we will need to successfully transition customers who currently buy monochrome displays for camcorder applications to purchase color displays  which we introduced in  in order to retain our cyberdisplay camcorder customers 
international sales represented and of revenues for and  respectively 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan and korea 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the relatively stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  was million for compared to million for  an increase of approximately million or 
cost of product revenues as a percent of sales for and was and  respectively 
the increase in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product sales is a result of manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the introduction of our led products and a decline of display revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
the led inefficiencies primarily result from an under utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in and we invested in increasing our led capacity 
we currently do not sell sufficient amounts of leds for the led product line to have a positive gross margin 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by lower display revenues as a percentage of total revenues because display products have higher gross margins than our iii v products 
research and development 
research and development expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
funded research and development expenses were million in as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
internal research and development expenses were million in compared to million for internal research and development expenses were primarily attributed to the development of our new iii v products  leds and color filter displays 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
s  g a expenses were million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in s  g a expense from the corresponding prior year is principally the result of an increase in insurance costs and professional fees resulting from the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  in the second quarter of  we increased our investment in kowon  our korean subsidiary  by acquiring an additional ownership for  we determined that  of the  represented compensation expense to previous management owners of the equity interest and it was expensed in s  g a 
in  we issued  restricted stock awards to certain employees of the company 
each award requires the employee to fulfill certain obligations including remaining employed by the company for periods of either two or four years the restriction period 
in connection with the issuance of the awards the company 
table of contents recorded a deferred compensation expense of  which will be amortized over the restriction period

other expenses  primarily amortization of patents and licenses  were  for compared to  for other income and expense  net 
other income and expense  net was an income of million for compared to a loss of million for in the second quarter of  we exchanged our interest in kendin communications  inc kendin for approximately million shares of micrel incorporated micrel as part of micrel s acquisition of kendin 
our investment in kendin had a carrying value of million at december  at the date of the exchange the closing price of micrel s common stock was per share and we recorded a gain of million as a result of this exchange in the quarter ended june  during the third quarter of the company sold  micrel shares and recorded a gain of approximately  we have accounted for our investment in micrel as available for sale securities since the receipt of micrel shares 
in the second quarter of we received an additional  shares of micrel which had been held in escrow 
in addition  during the second and fourth quarters of we sold  and  shares  respectively  of micrel 
as a result of these transactions we recorded losses of approximately  and million in the second and fourth quarters  respectively 
on december  the closing price of micrel s common stock was per share 
as a result of the continuing decline in the price of micrel common stock we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million in the statement of operations 
during the third quarter of we sold  shares of micrel and recorded a gain of approximately  since the receipt of the micrel shares we have sold approximately  shares for total proceeds of million 
as of december  we held approximately  shares of micrel common stock  valued at million 
other income and expense  net also includes interest income of million for compared to million for in and we also recorded losses of million and  respectively  which represent recognition of equity losses on our investment in kopin taiwan corp 
in we had a net loss of  of foreign exchange losses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues for were million compared to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
for  iii v and cyberdisplay revenues were million and million  respectively  versus million and million  respectively  for the increase in iii v product revenues in compared to resulted from an increase in demand in from customers who buy our hbt transistor wafers for integration into components used in wireless handsets 
demand in also benefited on a comparative basis from the prior year because demand was affected by a build up of hbt inventory at our customers in which they used in and reduced hbt demand accordingly 
the increase in cyberdisplay product revenues in compared to resulted primarily from an increase in demand from existing customers who use our display in camcorders 
international sales represented and of revenues for and  respectively 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan and korea 

table of contents cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  was million for compared to million in  a decrease of approximately million or 
cost of product revenues as a percent of sales for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of product revenues as a percentage of sales is a result of the fixed cost nature of our business whereby our fixed production costs per unit decline as sales unit volume increases  declines in raw material costs  particularly gallium arsenide wafers  and labor productivity increases 
research and development 
research and development expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
funded research and development expenses were million for compared to million in  an increase of

internal research and development expenses were million for compared to million in internal research and development expenses were primarily attributed to the development of our new iii v product  light emitting diodes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
s  g  a expenses were million for compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the reduction in s  g a expense from the corresponding prior year is principally the result of discontinuing goodwill amortization of approximately million  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and lower legal and patent maintenance fees of million and bad debt expenses of million 
in addition  s  g  a expenses include non cash charges for compensation expense of  in relating to the issuance of certain stock options 
we completed the transfer of technology from our columbia  maryland facility to our taunton  massachusetts facility and closed the columbia  maryland facility in charges in for the estimated remaining lease payments under the lease of this facility of  and the writedown of the unamortized cost of equipment and improvements at this facility of million were recorded in the accompanying financial statements 
impairment charge 
in and early as a result of actual and forecasted demand  we expanded our production capacity in our iii v product line 
as a result of a decline in our revenues during the second quarter of  we reviewed our capacity against revised forecasted demand and assessed the recoverability of certain machines used in our iii v manufacturing operations 
based on these forecasts  we did not believe these machines would be placed back into service in the foreseeable future  we anticipate these machines would be replaced by newer  more efficient equipment before demand would recover 
as a result of our analysis  and other analyses pertaining to the impact of the change in business conditions  we recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of representing the remaining unamortized cost of the identified equipment and other costs 
other 
other expenses  primarily amortization of patents and licenses  were  for compared to  in other income and expense  net 
other income and expense  net was a loss of million for compared to income of million for in the second quarter of  we exchanged our interest in kendin communications  inc kendin for approximately million shares of micrel incorporated micrel as part of micrel s acquisition of kendin 
our investment in kendin had a carrying value of million at december  at the date of the exchange the closing price of micrel s common stock was and we recorded a gain of million as a result of this exchange in the quarter ended june  during the third quarter of the company sold  micrel shares and recorded a gain of approximately  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our equity securities  research and development contract revenues  and sales of our iii v and cyberdisplay products 
in november we filed a registration statement using a shelf registration process that we may  from time to time  offer shares of common stock or debt securities  the aggregate total of which will not exceed million 
as of december  we had issued  shares for million and reduced the amount available under the registration statement to million 
we believe our available cash resources will support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and sale of micrel stock for million offset by capital expenditures of million and the purchase of additional shares of our korean subsidiary  kowon  of  the increase in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was favorably impacted by approximately million due to an increase at december  as compared to december  in accounts payable and accrued expense amounts 
the increase in the accounts payable and accrued expense balances were primarily the result of the timing of payments at year end 
the company has entered into a non cancelable agreement with a vendor to purchase million worth of product during the year ending december  in october we amended a supply agreement with a significant hbt customer that now expires in july under the terms of this agreement we agreed to maintain capacity levels for manufacturing hbt wafers and we committed to a pricing schedule under certain circumstances 
the agreement also requires us to give prior notice if we exit our hbt product line 
in consideration for this agreement the customer agreed to source of its hbt wafer needs from us subject to the customer s right to source hbt wafers from other sources if we are unable to meet their requirements under certain circumstances 
we agreed that failure to meet our supply obligations under the agreement would allow our customer to obtain court ordered specific performance and if we do not perform we could then be liable for monetary damages up to a maximum of  we lease facilities located in taunton and westborough  massachusetts  scotts valley  california  and columbia  maryland  under non cancelable operating leases 
the taunton leases expire through may the westborough lease expires in april the scotts valley lease expires in the maryland lease expires in we expect to expend between and million on capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily for the acquisition of equipment relating to the production of our iii v and cyberdisplay products 
on october   we authorized the re purchase of up to million of our common stock over a two year period 
we had not repurchased any common stock through december  as of december   we had tax loss carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used to offset future federal taxable income through recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments 
sfas no 
became effective for us in july we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
generally  the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is otherwise effective at the beginning of interim periods beginning after june  we have not entered into any financial instruments within the scope of the statement 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business has not historically been seasonal in nature because we have been increasing our market share in certain products 
however  the markets we sell into are traditionally seasonal and we would expect that as our business matures  our third quarter would be our strongest sales quarter followed by our second quarter then our fourth quarter and our first quarter would be our lowest sales quarter 
did not follow this pattern as our third quarter was impacted by a decline in demand from a large hbt customer 
in the third quarter we negotiated a new supply agreement with this customer whereby they would source of their hbt requirements from us 
in conjunction with this agreement the hbt customer consumed its remaining inventory of hbt product  which it had previously purchased from other vendors  which lowered its demand for our hbt product in the third quarter of inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflationary forces 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for operating leases and purchase obligations as of december  contractual obligations total years years thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in high quality government and corporate financial instruments which bear lower levels of relative risk 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
included in other assets is an equity investment in micrel  incorporated micrel totaling approximately million which is subject to changes in value because of either specific operating issues at micrel or an overall changes in the stock market 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiary s financial position  results of operations  and transaction gains and losses as a result of non us dollar denominated cashflows related to business activities in asia 
we do not believe that changes in currency will have a material impact on our financial position

these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in outcomes and results  include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
we have experienced a history of losses and have a significant accumulated deficit 
since inception  we have incurred significant net operating losses 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure investors that we will achieve profitability in the future 
our revenue and cash flow could be negatively affected by the loss of any of the few customers who account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
a few customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
the table below indicates what percentage of our total revenues from a particular customer were in a given year 
the symbol indicates that sales to that particular customer for the given year were below percent of our total revenues 
skyworks solutions  inc was formed through the merger of conexant systems wireless division and alpha industries in the sales to skyworks solutions as a percent of kopin s total revenues described below are on a pro forma basis assuming the merger occurred on january  customer sales as a percent of total revenue skyworks solutions  inc samsung electronics matsushita electric corp 
panasonic victor company of japan jvc mitsubishi electric company united states government we anticipate that sales to skyworks solutions  samsung and jvc will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the near future 
we believe that historically we have provided skyworks solutions with the vast majority of its hbt transistor wafers 
a reduction or delay in orders from any of our significant customers would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability 
we may be unable to increase revenues from cyberdisplay products if new products and applications are not developed 
cyberdisplay revenues for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in cyberdisplay revenues has resulted primarily from a decrease in the average sales price of our monochrome cyberdisplay product to customers for use in camcorders 
we believe the average sales price of our monochrome displays will continue to decline 
we believe we have captured significant market share in the camcorder market and future growth in this market is limited 
accordingly  if we are unable to expand into new markets our revenues from cyberdisplay products may not grow which may impact our ability to become profitable 
for we have identified the digital still camera market as a potential market to penetrate with our cyberdisplays 
we have very limited experience in selling displays to digital still camera makers 
we believe 
table of contents our success in penetrating this market will significantly impact our ability to increase sales of cyberdisplays 
accordingly if we are unable to successfully sell our displays to digital still camera makers we may be unable to grow cyberdisplay revenues and our ability to achieve profitability will be adversely affected 
an important factor in our ability to expand into new markets such as digital still cameras will be the development of new displays which have higher or lower resolution than current displays offered and which can provide color images 
we have never produced displays which provide color images in volume 
accordingly  if we are unable to develop and market these new displays or if we are unable to manufacture them in a cost effective manner our revenues may not grow and we may not be able to achieve profitability 
our competitors can provide integrated solutions 
many portable consumer electronic devices  including camcorders and digital still cameras  have two displays for viewing images  an electronic view finder and a flip out or group view display 
we provide the display which is used as the electronic view finder 
our competitors may offer both displays and both displays may be run by the same interface electronics 
a customer who buys our display is required to buy the flip out or group view display from another vendor who may compete with us 
this may require our customer to purchase additional interface electronics to run our display 
our competitors may be able to offer a bundled solution of both displays and the interface electronics cheaper than the cost of buying our display and the other display and the interface electronics separately 
if we are unable to offer displays with sufficient performance advantages over other displays to justify the additional cost of buying individual components versus a bundled solution or if our customers can not procure interface electronics with which to run our display which are cost efficient we may lose market share or be unable to grow our business which in turn would adversely affect our ability to become profitable 
our cyberdisplay products may not be widely accepted by the market 
our success will in large part depend on the widespread adoption of the viewing format of our cyberdisplay products in multiple applications 
our success also depends upon the widespread consumer acceptance of our customers products 
cyberdisplay products work best when used close to the eye which may not be acceptable to consumers 
potential customers may be reluctant to adopt our cyberdisplay products because of concerns surrounding perceived risks relating to the introduction of our display technology generally  consumer acceptance of our cyberdisplay products  and the relative complexity  reliability  usefulness and cost effectiveness of our display products compared to other display products available in the market or that may be developed by our competitors 
in addition  our customers may be reluctant to rely upon a relatively small company such as ours for a critical component 
we cannot assure investors that prospective customers will adopt our cyberdisplay products or that consumers will accept our cyberdisplay products in future applications 
if we fail to achieve market acceptance of our cyberdisplay products  our business may not be successful and we may not be able to achieve profitability 
our ability to manufacture and distribute our cyberdisplay products would be severely limited if the third parties that we rely on to manufacture integrated circuits for our cyberdisplay products fail to provide those services 
we depend on a taiwanese and a korean company for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our cyberdisplay products 
we have no long term contracts with either of these two companies 
these two companies use different methods to manufacture the integrated circuits and a shortage in one company can not necessarily be supplied by the other company 
if either company were to terminate its arrangement with us or become unable to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis  we would be able to manufacture and ship our cyberdisplay products only in limited quantities until replacement foundry services could be obtained 
furthermore  we cannot assure investors that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms 

table of contents our reliance on these foundries involves certain risks  including lack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the risks associated with international commerce  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs and trade policies and political and economic instability 
one of the foundries and several other third parties with which we do business are located in taiwan 
due to the earthquake that occurred in taiwan in and the typhoon that occurred in taiwan in september  many taiwanese companies  including the taiwanese foundry we use  experienced related business interruptions 
our business could suffer significantly if either of the foundries we use had operations which were disrupted for an extended period of time  due to natural disaster or political unrest 
in addition  our cyberdisplays are manufactured on inch silicon wafers 
state of the art silicon production uses inch wafers 
we can not be assured that if the inch manufacturing facilities we use were damaged that they would in fact be restored 
if the inch production facilities were not restored we may be required to redesign our displays so that they can be manufactured on an inch production line 
if the displays had to be redesigned we may have to have the displays re qualified by our customers  which would adversely affect our business until such qualification was complete 
in  there was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
there have been reports that consumer demand was negatively impacted by the outbreak of sars 
our sales  manufacturing and distribution processes  and in turn our overall business operations  may be adversely affected if sars or similar situations occurred 
we depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and other critical raw materials for use with our cyberdisplay products 
we do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets necessary for use with our cyberdisplay products 
instead  we rely on third party independent contractors for these integrated circuit chip sets and other critical raw materials such as special glasses and chemicals 
motorola currently produces many of the integrated circuit chip sets used with our cyberdisplay products in camcorders 
the critical raw materials  including the glasses and chemicals used in manufacturing the cyberdisplay  are used by other display manufacturers  many of which are much larger than kopin 
if motorola or any other third party were unable or unwilling to supply these integrated circuit chip sets or other critical raw materials to us  we would be unable to manufacture and sell our cyberdisplay products until a replacement supplier could be found 
we cannot assure investors that a replacement supplier could be found on reasonable terms or in a timely manner 
in the past we have experienced situations when our vendors could not supply the quantity or quality of critical raw materials we needed 
as a result  we were unable to meet customer demand and our manufacturing yield and gross margins were adversely affected 
currently there is strong world wide demand for display materials because of the significant growth of display sales over the last few years 
any interruption in our ability to manufacture and distribute our cyberdisplay products could cause our display business to be unsuccessful and the value of investors investment in us may decline 
if we are unable to significantly increase our unit sales volume and reduce our production costs  our business will suffer 
our iii v and cyberdisplay product lines currently have significant fixed costs and our ability to achieve profitability depends upon achieving significant sales volumes and higher gross profit margins 
in january we introduced our cyberlite light emitting diode led product 
our leds and heterojunction bipolar transistor hbt products comprise our iii v product group 
if we are unable to increase our iii v and cyberdisplay production levels and reduce manufacturing costs  we may lose customer orders and our business will remain unprofitable 
we may be unable to increase revenues from hbt transistor wafers if new product applications are not developed 
a critical market for our hbts is wireless handsets 
the growth rate of the wireless handset market has been very unpredictable over the last several years 
we expect prices of our hbt transistor will decline by 
table of contents to percent during if the wireless handset market grows in the range of to percent for the year ending december  we would not expect hbt revenues to increase unless we increase our market share 
accordingly  if we are unable to find additional applications for our hbt transistor wafers or increase our market share  our hbt transistor revenue may not grow which may impact our ability to become profitable 
we have never manufactured cyberlite products in volume and may not be able to achieve sales or production volume 
we anticipate our cyberlite products will be very important to our revenue growth and to achieving profitability 
however  we have never manufactured our cyberlite products in volume 
since our initial sales of cyberlite in january we have had low manufacturing yields and a negative gross margin 
improving yields is made more difficult as customers continually demand better performing products 
our ability to achieve profitability is also impacted by declining sales prices  which we experienced in we currently do not sell our cyberlite products in sufficient volume to cover our operating costs 
failure to achieve high sales volume production at acceptable prices will affect our revenue growth  our ability to become profitable and acceptance of our cyberlite products 
further  even if we are able to achieve volume production we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner  which would negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability 
if we are unable to achieve profitability or generate positive cash flow from our cyberlite products  we may be required to take an impairment charge on the long lived assets used in the production of cyberlite products 
we currently have approximately million of equipment used in the production of cyberlite leds 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers  which makes forecasting our revenues and operating results difficult 
we generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our products 
our business is characterized by short term purchase orders and shipment schedules and we generally permit orders to be canceled or rescheduled before shipment without significant penalty 
as a result  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time  which makes forecasting our revenues difficult 
in addition  due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our operating results are difficult to forecast because we are continuing to invest in capital equipment and increasing our operating expenses for new product development 
if we fail to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results  our business may not be successful and the value of investors investment in us may decline 
we may not be able to realize any profits under a multi year supply agreement with a significant hbt customer 
in october we amended a supply agreement with a significant hbt customer that now expires in july under the terms of this agreement we agreed to maintain capacity levels for manufacturing hbt wafers and we committed to a pricing schedule under certain circumstances 
the agreement also requires us to give prior notice if we exit our hbt product line 
in consideration for this agreement the customer agreed to source of its hbt wafer needs from us subject to the customer s right to source hbt wafers from other sources if we are unable to meet their requirements under certain circumstances 
we agreed that failure to meet our supply obligations under the agreement would allow our customer to obtain court ordered specific performance 
if we do not perform we could then be liable for monetary damages up to a maximum of million 
the agreement obligates us to provide wafers at preset prices and as a result  our ability to make a profit under this agreement will be subject to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and to any increase in costs of goods or services requires for us to perform under the agreement 
if we are unable to manufacture the hbt wafers below these preset prices we may not be able to achieve profitability 
potential fluctuations in operating results make financial forecasting difficult and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly for several reasons  including the timing and successful introduction of additional manufacturing capacity  the timing of the initial selection of our iii v and cyberdisplay products as a component in our customers new products  
table of contents availability of interface electronics for our cyberdisplay products supplied by motorola and other vendors  competitive pressures on selling prices of our products  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  our ability to successfully reduce costs  the cancellation of us government contracts  and our ability to secure agreements from our major customers for the purchase of our products 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our operating results are difficult to forecast because we are continuing to invest in capital equipment and increasing our operating expenses for new product development 
as a result of these and other factors  investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results 
if our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
we may not be able to operate multiple manufacturing facilities successfully 
a critical part of our business strategy is the expansion of our production capacity both internally and using third party manufacturers 
we are developing an internal facility to manufacture our cyberlite led products 
we increasingly rely on our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon  for back end packaging of our cyberdisplay products 
if we are unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing capacity at kowon  we may be able to manufacture and ship our cyberdisplay products only in limited quantities until replacement foundry services could be obtained 
we are also considering the establishment of additional internal and third party manufacturing capabilities to produce both our iii v and cyberdisplay products 
to date  we have operated only one facility for our iii v product line 
our ability to successfully operate additional manufacturing sites will depend on a number of factors  including the identification and availability of appropriate and affordable sites  the management of facility construction and development timing and costs  the transfer of our manufacturing techniques to additional sites  particularly kowon  the establishment of adequate management and information systems and financial controls  and the adaptation of our complex manufacturing processes in our additional sites 
additionally  we cannot be sure that any new or expanded manufacturing facilities will have operating results similar to those of our current facilities 
any failure to effectively implement our expansion strategy would adversely impact our ability to grow our business 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or lower prices for our products 
competition in the markets for our products is intense and we may not be able to compete successfully 
we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling integrated circuits or alternative display technologies  as well as the supply of other discrete products 
our competitors could develop new process technologies that may be superior to ours  including technologies that target markets in which our products are sold 
many of our existing and potential competitors have strong market positions  considerable internal manufacturing capacity  established intellectual property rights and substantial technological capabilities 
furthermore  they also have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and personnel resources than we do  and we may not be able to compete successfully with them 

table of contents in addition  many of our existing and potential customers manufacture or assemble displays  wireless communications devices and light emitting diodes and have substantial in house technological capabilities and substantially greater resources than we do 
we may not be able to sell our products to these customers and they may begin to commercialize their internal capabilities and become our competitors 
if one of our large customers establishes internal design and manufacturing capabilities  it could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we expect competition to increase 
this could mean lower prices or reduced demand for our products 
any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
disruptions of our production of our iii v products would adversely affect our operating results 
if we were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of our facilities  we would be unable to supply iii v products to our customers 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and customer specifications are extremely precise 
we periodically modify our processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and to meet particular customer requirements 
process changes or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process can result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields 
additionally  as we introduce new equipment into our manufacturing processes  our iii v products could be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
we may experience manufacturing problems that would result in delays in product introduction and delivery or yield fluctuations 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the shortage of raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
if we fail to keep pace with changing technologies  we may lose customers 
the advanced semiconductor materials and display industries are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving technologies and industry standards 
to achieve our goals  we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards and requirements and customer preferences 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes  our business could suffer 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate 
we also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws 
our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while in our employ 
these measures may not adequately protect our intellectual and proprietary rights 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws afford only limited protection and our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not fully protect our intellectual property rights 
misappropriation of our technology and the costs of defending our intellectual property rights from misappropriation could substantially impair our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our business may not be successful and the value of investors investment in us may decline 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
companies in the light emitting diode led  wireless communications  semiconductor and display industries steadfastly pursue and protect intellectual property rights 
this has resulted in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property 
our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents or inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business 
if we are forced to defend against infringement claims  we may face such costly litigation  diversion of technical and management personnel  and product shipment delays  even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted 
if there is a successful claim of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  or if we are required to cease using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us  it could adversely affect our business 

table of contents our business could suffer if we lose the services of  or fail to attract  key personnel 
in order to continue to provide quality products in our rapidly changing business  we believe it is important to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business 
our success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees  including dr 
john cc fan  our president and chief executive officer  could seriously impede our success 
we do not maintain any key man insurance policies on dr 
fan or any other employees 
in addition  due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers  our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions 
if the wireless and fiber optic communications markets experience an upturn  we may need to increase our workforce 
due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate  we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel 
our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to develop and manufacture our products 
we may be unable to grow at our historical growth rates or at all  and if we grow we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
in and  we experienced significant growth in sales of our iii v and cyberdisplay products 
we believe that the high growth rates of and  driven principally by sales of our hbt transistor wafers  were the result of the adoption of digital wireless handsets 
due to a significant slowdown in the wireless and fiber optic communication markets and other general economic conditions  our sales declined in in addition  we cannot assure investors that our systems  procedures  controls and existing and planned space will be adequate to support our future operations 
as a result of these concerns  we cannot be sure that we will grow  or  if we do grow  that we will be able to achieve our historical growth rate 
we may pursue acquisitions and investments that could adversely affect our business 
in the past we have made  and in the future we may make  acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand our business 
if we identify an acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business and products 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets 
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental regulations or if we did not comply with these regulations in the past 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production  or a cessation of operations 
we cannot assure investors that we have not  in the past  violated applicable laws or regulations which could result in required remediation or other liabilities 
investors should not expect to receive dividends from us 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past  nor do we expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that earnings  if any  will be retained for the development of our businesses 
our stock price may be volatile in the future 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the wireless communications  semiconductor and display markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and trading volatility 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock
