background we are an integrated media and entertainment company principally engaged in the development  production and marketing of television programming and live events and the licensing and sale of branded consumer products featuring our highly successful brands 
our operations are organized around two principal activities live and televised entertainment  which consists of live event and television programming 
revenues consist principally of ticket sales to live events  sale of television advertising and sponsorships  television rights fees and pay per view buys 
branded merchandise  which consists of licensing and direct sale of merchandise 
revenues consist principally of sale of merchandise at live events such as t shirts and caps  magazines and home videos  and royalties from products sold by licensees such as video games  toys and books

revenue from sources outside of north america represented of total net revenue in as compared to in operating income increased substantially due to the cost reduction initiatives taken in fiscal that impact both business segments as well as selling  general and administrative expenses 
income from continuing operations primarily reflects the impact of items noted above and improved returns on short term investments 
additional details regarding these summary results follow below 
the following chart provides revenues and key drivers for our live and televised segment live and televised revenues better worse live events number of events average attendance average ticket price dollars pay per view number of buys from domestic pay per view events domestic retail price  excluding wrestlemania dollars advertising average weekly household ratings for raw average weekly household ratings for smackdown sponsorship revenues television rights fees domestic international live events revenue decreased due to lower attendance at our events offset in part by an increase in the average price of tickets sold 
pay per view revenues increased approximately due to the success of our premier event  wrestlemania xx  which was held in march wrestlemania xx achieved approximately  buys as compared to approximately  buys for wrestlemania xix in fiscal advertising revenues decreased due to a modification of our television distribution agreement with upn 
since october  upn has been selling all advertising inventory for our smackdown broadcasts and paying us a rights fee 
this arrangement accounts for a decrease of approximately million in advertising revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by the airing of make good spots which reduced our allowance for underdelivery by approximately million 
the increase in the domestic rights fees for the current year is derived from rights fee paid to us under our modified arrangement with upn as discussed above 
the following chart provides revenues and key drivers for our branded merchandise segment branded merchandise revenues better worse licensing merchandise domestic per capita spending dollars publishing net units sold home video net units sold dvd vhs internet advertising the decrease in merchandise revenue is primarily due to a million decrease in the merchandise sold in arenas at our live events 
this decrease reflects lower attendance at these events and a change that occurred in fiscal from the direct sale of merchandise to a licensing arrangement for merchandise sold at our canadian and international events 
publishing revenues declined due to reductions in both newsstand copies and subscription copies sold for our two monthly magazines 
additionally  we produced two fewer special editions in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the increase of approximately million units of dvd sales  which carry a higher price point  drove the increase in home video revenues for the current year 
several successful titles released in the current year included the ultimate ric flair collection  which chronicles over three decades of ric flair s illustrious career  the monday night war  an account of the rivalry between wwe and wcw in the late s and wrestlemania xx 
these three titles sold a total of approximately  units in fiscal in addition  we gained distribution in one large retailer in  thereby increasing sales 
cost of revenues better worse live and televised branded merchandise total profit contribution margin cost of revenues live and televised better worse live events pay per view advertising television other total profit contribution margin the decrease in advertising cost of revenues results primarily from the modification of our upn distribution agreement 
the impact of this change is a reduction in advertising revenues which was offset by an increase in television rights fees and the elimination of the participation costs to upn 
although there should be no material effect on our net income relative to this change in terms  it should result in a favorable impact to our profit margins in future periods 
cost of revenues branded merchandise better worse licensing merchandise publishing home video digital media other total profit contribution margin net negative licensing costs in fiscal is due to the reversal of million of previously accrued licensing agent commissions 
these costs had been accrued over the period from fiscal through fiscal and have been reversed because payment is no longer considered probable as a result of favorable litigation developments 
excluding this reversal  licensing cost of revenues decreased by approximately million primarily due to lower costs associated with our music business and a greater mix of non royalty bearing revenue in the current fiscal year 
during fiscal we recorded a pre tax charge of million in merchandise cost of revenues for the impairment of certain long lived assets of our e commerce business 
these assets were primarily composed of capitalized software development costs incurred during the set up of the e commerce section of our website 
merchandise and publishing costs of revenues decreased in conjunction with fewer units sold for both businesses 
in addition  merchandise cost of revenues decreased due to the change from the direct sale of merchandise to a licensing arrangement for merchandise sold at our canadian and international events 
home video costs increased in correlation with the increase in units sold for the year  particularly distribution and duplication related fees 
the following chart reflects the amounts and percent change of certain significant overhead items selling  general administrative expenses better worse staff related legal  accounting and other professional settlement of litigation  net advertising and promotion bad debt all other total sg a sg a as a percentage of net revenues the increase in staff related costs is primarily attributable to approximately million of payments under the company s management incentive programs  made as a result of our improved financial results 
legal expenses incurred in fiscal declined by approximately million in the current year in conjunction with lower litigation activity in in fiscal  we received a favorable settlement of approximately million 
included in settlement of litigation in fiscal was a million settlement of a legal dispute partially offset by million of other net favorable settlements 
the million negative amount of bad debt expense in fiscal is due to a payment received from a pay per view service provider that had been fully reserved in the prior year 
stock compensation costs option exchange offer other grants of restricted stock units total stock compensation costs stock compensation expense relates to our restricted stock programs 
these programs were initiated in fiscal during  we completed an exchange offer that gave all active employees and independent contractors who held stock options with a grant price of or higher the ability to exchange their options  at a to ratio  for restricted stock units  or  for holders with fewer than  options  for cash at of the average price of per share  during the offering period 
overall  million options were eligible for the offer  of which million were exchanged for either cash or restricted stock units 
in exchange for the options tendered  we granted an aggregate of  restricted stock units and made cash payments in the aggregate amount of approximately million  which will result in a total compensation charge of approximately million  of which the cash payment of million to employees was recorded in our third fiscal quarter ended january   and the portion related to the grant of the restricted stock units to employees will be recorded over the units month vesting period 
as a result  million of the compensation charge related to the option exchange program was recorded in fiscal and the remaining will be recorded as follows approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal also in  we granted  restricted stock units at per share 
such issuances were granted to officers and employees under our long term incentive plan the plan 
although originally scheduled to amortize over the seven year vesting period  a provision of the grants stipulated if ebitda of million was achieved in any fiscal year during the vesting period  the unvested restricted stock units would immediately vest and  accordingly  the unamortized balance at that date would be expensed 
because our ebitda exceeded million in fiscal  we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter for the immediate vesting of the remaining restricted stock units 
ebitda is a measure of our operating performance  and is defined in the plan as earnings from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
better worse depreciation and amortization the increase is primarily attributable to the amortization of the acquired film libraries and the depreciation of the corporate jet 
in january  we paid million to pay off a lease on our corporate aircraft 
the purchase price of the aircraft  net of a million estimated residual value  is being depreciated on a straight line basis over a year period 
as a result of this purchase  annual depreciation expense will increase by million 
we believe this transaction will result in lower net financing costs 
better worse interest income the increase in interest income is a result of the switch of our liquid assets from primarily cash to other forms of short term investments in the current year 
better worse interest expense better worse other income loss  net during fiscal  we recorded a million write down of investments deemed other than temporarily impaired 
provision for income taxes provision effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of capital losses in fiscal for which no tax benefit can be recorded

income from discontinued operations was million for fiscal year with no income or loss recorded in fiscal year the results from fiscal reflected our final settlement of substantially all remaining liabilities at less than the originally projected amount

better worse interest expense other loss income  net during fiscal  we recorded a million write down of investments deemed other than temporarily impaired

also in fiscal  we wrote down million related to certain warrants that we previously received from a television programming distribution partner 
as a result of the continued decline in the market value of this company s common stock coupled with our shortened window to exercise  management determined that this asset was other than temporarily impaired 
provision for income taxes provision effective tax rate the increase in the effective tax rate was due to capital losses generated in fiscal which may not be deductible for tax purposes 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that these losses will not be fully utilized and  as such  we have recorded a valuation allowance against these benefits 
discontinued operations xfl

as of june   we had approximately million invested primarily in fixed income mutual funds and short term us treasury notes 
our investment policy is designed to preserve capital and minimize interest rate  credit and market risk 
nevertheless  the company foresees a rising interest rate environment and we may incur some capital loss  which we anticipate will be offset by the opportunity to earn higher interest rates on short term securities and mutual funds 
in fiscal  we had capital expenditures of approximately million  excluding the purchase of the corporate jet  consisting primarily of digital media equipment for our website  television equipment and conversion of our critical business and financial systems 
in january  we paid million to pay off a lease on our corporate aircraft

this transaction did not affect other aspects of our business relationship with viacom

we have declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of per share on both the class a common stock and class b common stock in each fiscal quarter since june the class a common stock and class b common stock are entitled to equal per share dividends

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate  interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our results of operations 
our foreign currency exchange rate risk is minimized by maintaining minimal net assets and liabilities in currencies other than our functional currency 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolio 
our debt primarily consists of the mortgage related to our corporate headquarters  which has an annual interest rate of 
due to the recent decreases in mortgage rates  this debt is now at a rate in excess of market  however due to the terms of our agreement we are prohibited from refinancing for several years 
the impact of the decrease in mortgage rates is considered immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income mutual funds and united states treasury notes  with a strong emphasis placed on preservation of capital 
in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  our investment portfolio s dollar weighted duration is approximately one year 
due to the nature of our investments and our strategy to minimize market and interest rate risk  we believe that our portfolio would not be materially impacted by adverse fluctuations in interest rates
