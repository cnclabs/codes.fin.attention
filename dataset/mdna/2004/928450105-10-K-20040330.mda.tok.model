the remaining increase is attributable to vita 
the company has in the past and expects in the future to experience significant fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
as the tables indicate  historically the company s net sales and net income have typically been the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s business is seasonal because its sales volume increases significantly during the christmas holiday season and  to a lesser extent  during other holidays in the fall and spring and periods of colder weather in certain sections of the country 
certain of these holidays  including passover  easter  yom kippur and rosh hashanah  may fall in different quarters in different years and could cause the quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the future 
however  the company believes that through the vita specialty food acquisitions and the introduction of new non seasonal or counter seasonal products  it can  over time  reduce the variability in its quarterly operating results by increasing sales during the second and third quarters of each year

in november  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fss which deferred the effective dates for applying certain provisions of sfas related to mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain non public entities and certain mandatory redeemable non controlling interests for public and non public companies

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment area in the application of its accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  returns  bad debts  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and marketing program costs revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to customers in fulfillment of customer orders 
in accordance with industry practices  inventory is sold to customers often with the right to return or dispose if the merchandise is not sold prior to the expiration of its shelf life 
in order to support the company s products  various marketing programs are offered to customers which reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to the company s products 
the company regularly reviews and revises  when it deems necessary  estimates of costs to the company for these marketing and merchandising programs based on estimates of what has been incurred by customers 
actual costs incurred by the company may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs or other conditions differ from expectations 
sales are reduced by a provision for estimated future returns  disposals and promotional expenses 
tax assets and liabilities the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities based upon currently enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
acquisition and exit costs during the year ending december   the company recorded  of costs relating to activities of pre acquisition halifax such as severance and related benefits  the cost of abandoned leaseholds and the costs to vacate previously leased facilities 
these costs were accounted for under eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
goodwill carrying value in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  the company assesses the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
when the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company will review for impairment under the provisions of sfas the provisions of sfas also required the completion of transitional impairment test for goodwill within months of adoption  with any impairment treated as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the transitional impairment test  which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill 
during the fourth quarter  the company completed its annual impairment test  which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of its million credit agreement the credit agreement with interest rates subject to market fluctuations 
the company does not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of its debt 
the credit agreement includes a revolving line of credit with a bank  which at december  bore interest at the prime rate minus resulting in a rate for a portion of the debt and at libor plus resulting in a rate for another portion 
this rate remains constant until december  on that date  the interest rate may be adjusted based upon certain financial covenants and may range from prime minus to libor plus or  to libor plus 
in addition  the credit agreement includes two term loan facilities  one of which is active  and which at december  bore interest at the prime rate minus resulting in a rate for a portion of the debt and at libor plus resulting in a rate for another portion 
on december  the interest rate may be adjusted based on certain financial covenants  and may range from prime minus to libor plus or  to libor plus 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

the company currently has no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in pursuing other potential acquisitions 
however  the costs associated with this strategy  means of financing any potential acquisitions  and consummation and integration of any potential acquisitions could significantly impact the company s financial and operating performance
