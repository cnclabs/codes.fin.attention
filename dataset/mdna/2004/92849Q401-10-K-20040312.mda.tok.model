item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in business risks below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview vitria was incorporated in california october and reincorporated in delaware in july we initially generated revenues exclusively through consulting contracts with third parties and government grants 
in june  we commercially released our first product and in september  we had an initial public offering of common stock 
we have incurred significant losses since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we derive revenues primarily from two sources licenses  and services and other 
our products are typically licensed directly to customers for a perpetual term  with pricing based on the number of copies licensed  or systems or applications managed 
service and other revenues include product maintenance  consulting and training 
customers who license vitria businessware normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term  which is typically twelve months 
a majority of our customers use third party system integrators to implement our products 
customers typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
we also offer training classes for our customers and system integrators 
we market our products through our direct sales force and augment our marketing efforts through relationships with system integrators and technology vendors 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in the united states 
we have international sales offices in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  mexico  singapore  spain and the united kingdom 
over the last three years  the marketplace in which vitria competes has become increasingly competitive as more companies are offering products in our general markets 
additionally  over the same period increased competition has caused a steady decline in the average purchase price of our products 
while we have taken measures in and to reduce our overall cost structure to better match lower revenues  we must develop additional products to create revenue growth 
accordingly  we are developing a suite of products targeted to reduce specific components of our customers administrative costs 
while the success of our efforts cannot be predicted  we feel that our future revenue and margin growth will be dependent upon successfully selling these products 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from software licenses to end users for vitria businessware and other products and related services  which include maintenance and support  consulting and training services 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  we record revenue from software licenses when a license agreement is signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery of the product has occurred 
for electronic delivery  the product is considered to have been delivered when the access code to download the software from the internet has been provided to the customer 
if an element of the agreement has not been delivered  revenue for the element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the undelivered element  all revenue is deferred until sufficient objective evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we treat all arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable 
our normal payment terms currently range from net days to net days for domestic and international customers  respectively 
revenue is deferred for those agreements which exceed our normal payment terms and are therefore assessed as not being fixed or determinable 
revenue under these agreements is recognized as payments become due unless collectibility concerns exist  in which case revenue is deferred until payments are received 
our assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue on arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users  primarily third party systems integrators  is not recognized until evidence of a sell through arrangement to an end user has been received 
service and other revenues include product maintenance  consulting  and training 
customers who license vitria businessware normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term  which is typically twelve months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
many of our customers use third party system integrators to implement our products 
customers typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services which are sold on a per student or per class basis and recognized as the classes are attended 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
when the software license arrangement requires us to provide consulting services for significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized in accordance with the provision of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements using the percentage of completion method and  therefore  both product license and consulting services 
table of contents revenue are recognized as work progresses 
these arrangements have not been common and  therefore  the significant majority of our license revenue in the past three years has been recognized under sop  as amended 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to deliver required payments to us 
when we believe a collectibility issue exists with respect to a specific receivable  we record an allowance to reduce that receivable to the amount that we believe is collectible 
in addition  we record an allowance on the remainder of our receivables that are still in good standing based on our past write off experience 
in  the creditworthiness of our customer base improved over the prior year  resulting in our ability to reduce our receivable allowance 
however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
restructuring charges during  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the realignment of our business operations 
in addition  we recorded million in restructuring charges related to the realignment of our business operations in as of december   we have million in accrued restructuring expenses  consisting of  in severance charges and million for lease payments 
only costs resulting from a restructuring plan that are not associated with  or that do not benefit activities that will be continued  are eligible for recognition as liabilities at the commitment date 
these charges represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs that we have undertaken  and consist primarily of the cost of involuntary termination benefits and remaining contractual lease payments and other costs associated with closed facilities net of anticipated sublease income 
information regarding sublease income estimates for the amount of sublease income we are likely to receive and the timing of finding a tenant has been obtained from third party experts and are based on prevailing market rates 
the charges for facility closure costs require the extensive use of estimates  including estimates and assumptions related to future maintenance costs  our ability to secure sub tenants and anticipated sublease income to be received in the future 
if we fail to make accurate estimates or to complete planned activities in a timely manner  we might record additional charges or reverse previous charges in the future 
such additional charges or reversals will be recorded to the restructuring charges line in our statement of operations in the period in which additional information becomes available to indicate our estimates should be adjusted 
since april  we have revised our sublease income estimates at least semi annually due to significant downward trends in the real estate markets in the united states and in the united kingdom 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
this information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter

we expect that future results may be affected by the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenue in  of total revenues in  and of total revenues in in all three years  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenues 
as of december   california independent system operator accounted for of our accounts receivable balance 
as of december   bp oil international accounted for of our accounts receivable balance 
we expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a large percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and the overall cost effectiveness of our products 
license 
license revenues decreased from million in to million in license revenues decreased from million in to million in both of these decreases were due to fewer total orders and a decrease in our average deal size 
the decrease in our average deal size was due to downward pricing pressure on our base vitria businessware software offering as more companies are offering products in our general marketplace 
the decrease in the total number of orders can be attributed to both the increased number of competitors in our markets as well as overall maturation of the marketplace as a whole 
the general slowdown in information technology spending in our target markets due to slow us economic growth has also made it more difficult to grow our revenues 
service and other 
the level of service revenue is impacted by the number and size of license deals in a given period 
support for the first year is purchased as part of each license deal 
most of our consulting project revenue and customer training revenue is also affected by the size and number of license deals 
service and other revenue also includes support renewals  which is dependent upon our installed license base 
service and other revenues decreased from million in to million in consulting revenue  first year support and training revenue all decreased significantly  related to our decrease in license revenue 
these declines were offset by a significant increase in support renewals from customers who had purchased our products in previous years 
service and other revenues increased from million in to million in this increase in service revenue in was due to the growth of consulting revenues 
table of contents associated with license agreements signed in earlier periods 
support revenues remained flat in as some customers did not renew their maintenance during this time period 
included in service and other revenue for is approximately million of revenues related to government grants received in prior years 
this revenue previously had been included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet since pending the outcome of several government audits  which were finalized in the fourth quarter of we had concluded that revenues under these arrangements were not fixed or determinable until the expiration of the audits 
we have no further government grant related deferred revenue 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists of royalty payments to third parties for technology incorporated into our product 
fluctuations in cost of license is generally due to the buying patterns of our customers  as cost of license revenue is dependent upon which products our customers purchase  and which of those purchased products have third party technology incorporated into them 
cost of license revenues decreased from million in to  in cost of license revenues increased from million in to million in the decrease from to as well as the increase from to are both primarily due to the write off during of a non cancelable royalty agreement that we determined would have no future utility to us 
future fluctuations in cost of license revenues are dependent upon increases or decreases in sales of those particular products which incorporate third party technology 
service and other 
cost of service and other revenues consists of salaries  facility costs  travel expenses and payments to third party consultants incurred in providing customer support  training and implementation services 
cost of service and other revenues decreased from million in to million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased salary expenses related to our restructuring actions at the end of the first quarter of as well as reduced travel expenses due to fewer consulting projects in cost of service and other revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased travel expenses of million incurred by our professional services group related to increased consulting revenues in we expect that cost of service and other will decrease slightly in as compared to due to our restructuring actions in operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  field office expenses  travel  entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreases in salary and benefit expenses of million and reduced travel expenses of million due to our workforce reduction in the first quarter of  lower commission expenses of million due to lower license revenues in  and reduced facilities costs of million due to cost containment efforts  lease renegotiations and restructuring in first quarter of sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased salary expenses of million and decreased travel expense of million due to our workforce reductions in  decreased commissions of million due to lower license revenue and decreased facilities costs of million due to restructurings in we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease slightly in as compared to due to our restructuring actions in research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  and the cost of consulting resources that supplement the internal development team 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreases in salary and benefits expenses of million due to workforce reduction in  lower external consulting expenses of  due to cost containment efforts and reduced facility costs of million due to our facilities restructuring in research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this 
table of contents decrease was primarily due to decreased salary expenses of million arising from our workforce reductions in we anticipate that research and development expenses will decrease slightly in as compared to due to our restructuring actions in as well as shifting certain staffing functions to offshore vendors in india and china 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries for administrative  executive and finance personnel  information systems costs  outside professional service fees and our provision for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in salary and benefits expenses as a result of our workforce reductions in  and a reduction of million in external consulting expenses as a result of our cost containment efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this slight increase is primarily attributable to an increase in external consulting expenses of million associated with the implementation of our internal computer systems 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly in as compared to due to our restructuring actions in  which should decrease our costs  offset by higher costs to comply with sarbanes oxley act 
stock based compensation 
total stock based compensation expenses were  in  million in  and million in stock based compensation includes the amortization of unearned employee stock based compensation on options issued to employees prior to vitria completing its initial public offering in september and is being amortized over a five year vesting period 
during  we modified the stock option vesting terms of option grants made to two former executives 
in accordance with apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  we recorded  additional non cash stock based compensation expense in as a result of these grant modifications 
we expect to record employee stock based compensation expenses of approximately  for the year ending december   reflecting the amortization of the deferred stock based compensation remaining at december  unearned compensation expense will be reduced in future periods to the extent that options are terminated prior to vesting 
for the years ended december  and  we did not incur any stock based compensation expense in connection with stock issued to non employees for services 
for the year ended december   we recorded  of stock based compensation expense in connection with stock issued for services 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with the acquisition of xml solutions in april resulted in charges to earnings of million for the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the million amortized in also includes million of amortized goodwill 
during the year ended december   we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our intangible assets under the provision of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in light of sustained negative economic conditions which impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  effectively reducing the carrying value of all intangible assets to zero 
this charge was based on a comparison of the fair value of the underlying intangible assets  which was calculated based on the discounted cash flows expected during their remaining useful lives  to their carrying value 
while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in attributing cash flows to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 
impairment of goodwill 
we accounted for the acquisition of xmlsolutions in april under the purchase method of accounting which resulted in million of goodwill being recorded at the time of purchase 
goodwill associated with this purchase was to be amortized over its estimated life of three years 
however  in accordance with safs  as referenced in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning january   we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
during the year ended december   we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
the assessment was performed because our market capitalization had declined significantly  on what was considered to be an other than temporary basis  and because sustained negative economic conditions had impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
we evaluated goodwill under the provisions of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements during the second quarter of goodwill was tested for impairment 
table of contents by calculating the fair value of vitria as a whole  based on our market capitalization at june   and comparing the fair value to the book value of vitria  and then comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill in the quarter ended june   effectively reducing the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
restructuring and other charges 
in the year ended december  vitria initiated actions to reduce our cost structure due to sustained negative economic conditions that have impacted our operations and resulted in lower than anticipated revenues 
in april and august we reduced our workforce and consolidated our facilities 
the restructuring actions in resulted in a reduction in workforce of approximately employees or of vitria s workforce measured as of the beginning of and affected all departments 
all terminated employees had left vitria by the end of facilities in the united states and united kingdom were consolidated and related leasehold improvement and equipment were written off 
as a result of the restructuring actions  a charge of million in the year ended december  was incurred 
the restructuring charge included approximately million of severance related charges and million of committed excess facilities payments  which included  for the write off of leasehold improvements and equipment in vacated buildings 
in the first quarter of  we initiated actions to further reduce our cost structure 
the plan was a combination of a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  or of the existing workforce  further consolidations of facilities in the united states and united kingdom and the associated disposal of leasehold improvements and equipment 
the workforce reduction affected all functional areas and was largely completed in the quarter ended march  as a result of the restructuring plan  we incurred a charge of million in the quarter ended march  this charge included approximately million of severance related charges  million of committed excess facilities payments  and million in write offs of leasehold improvements and equipment 
the severance related charges consisted of one time termination benefits recognized and measured at fair value at the date the plan was communicated to the employees 
all of the terminated employees had left vitria by may  the excess facilities payments were measured at fair value as of the cease use date of the facilities using a discount rate of per annum 
all excess facilities were vacated prior to march  the leasehold improvements and equipment write offs  which were associated with vacating the excess facilities  were based on net book value as of the date of abandonment 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we incurred severance charges of  related to restructuring   of which was for the severance of jomei chang  vitria s former ceo  in the fourth quarter  and facility charges of million related to changes in sublease income assumptions for the facilities restructured in and in addition  we incurred  in accretion charges related to the fair value treatment for the facilities we restructured in  in accordance with statement of financial standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
as of december   million remains accrued from all of the restructuring actions   related to severance charges  and million related to facility closures 
the total accrued liability for lease termination costs of million at december  is net of million of estimated sublease income 
a portion of this liability is based on the fair value treatment required by sfas  which we adopted as of january  the facilities consolidation charges for all of our restructuring actions were calculated using management s best estimates and were based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
we have engaged brokers to locate tenants to sublease all of the excess facilities  and  to date  have signed one sublease agreement for one of the buildings 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
our ability to generate our estimated sublease income is highly dependent upon the existing economic conditions  particularly lease market conditions in certain geographies  at the time we negotiate the sublease arrangements with third parties 
while the amount we have accrued is our best estimate  these estimates are subject to change and may require routine adjustment as conditions change through the implementation period 
if macroeconomic 
table of contents conditions related to the commercial real estate market continue to worsen  we may be required to increase our estimated cost to exit certain facilities 
we expect to achieve annualized costs savings in excess of million from our restructuring actions 
the estimate of annualized costs savings consists of salary and travel expenses related to our reduction in headcount in addition to facility expenses related to the closure of several offices 
the restructuring actions reduced our cost structure and resulted in decreases in all of our income statement expense lines in due to the fact the restructuring occurred at the end of the first quarter of  we should see a significant decrease in expense from these restructuring actions when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of however  the restructuring will not have an impact on our quarterly year over year expense comparisons after the first quarter of  as the restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure occurred in the first quarter of in our estimated lease payout schedule in the table below in thousands  future lease payments are discounted and future sublease income is estimated based on third party estimates based on prevailing market rates 
contractually committed sublease income of million is included in the million of estimated sublease income 
total and estimated net thereafter payments future lease payments for restructured facilities estimated future sublease income net future payments on restructured facilities acquired in process technology 
in process technology represents that portion of the purchase price of an acquisition related to the research and development activities which have not demonstrated their technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we recognized an expense of million in in conjunction with the completion of the acquisition of xmlsolutions for in process technology relating to xmlsolutions collaborative enablement program 
interest income and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  decreased  from million in to million in interest and other income  net decreased  from million in to million in these decreases were mainly due to lower interest rates on our short term investments  lower interest generating cash and investment balances 
also in  we incurred a loss on disposition of our china subsidiary of  see related party transactions below and a charge of  for an other than temporary decline in value of our equity investment in a private company 
in  we incurred a charge of  associated with an other than temporary decline in value of our equity in the same company 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
income tax provisions in all periods presented relate to income taxes currently payable on income generated in non us tax jurisdictions  state income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes incurred on software license revenue 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we have evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
based on the cumulative pre tax losses we have sustained in the three years ended december   a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets of december   was recorded 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  
table of contents respectively 
the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards before utilization

in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in short term liabilities and million of long term liabilities  compared to approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in short term liabilities and million of long term liabilities at december  net cash used in operating activities decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a smaller net loss in as we reduced our expenses over the prior year and an increase in accrued restructuring expenses as we completed a restructuring in the first quarter of this was offset by much smaller changes during in accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances compared to the prior year 
net cash used in operating activities decreased million  or  in as compared to this was due to a larger net loss in than  offset by a decrease in our accounts receivable balances as we collected more cash than in the previous year and an increase in our accrued restructuring balance as we completed two restructurings in net cash provided by used in investing activities decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease in the current year was primarily due the fact that we purchased more short term investments than we sold as we moved more available cash to short term investments to improve our interest generated on available cash  compared to the prior year when we sold more short term investments than we purchased 
net cash provided by investing activities increased million  or  in compared to this increase reflects the fact that in we used more cash from the maturities of our investments to fund our operations than we had in net cash provided by financing activities decreased  or in compared to net cash provided by financing activities decreased million  or  from to these decreases were due to a lower number of stock option exercises during and as compared to the previous years which is the result of a lower stock price in and than in previous years 
during the year ended december   our net accounts receivable balance remained essentially flat  increasing only  from million at december  to million at december  the reason our accounts receivable balance remained essentially flat was due to lower revenues in which resulted in lower accounts receivables balances while collection efforts remained stable 
this decrease in gross receivables was offset by a lower allowance for doubtful accounts balance due to less risk on our receivables as the credit risk of our current customer base has improved from at december   our gross accounts receivable balance is million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of  during the year ended december   our deferred revenue balance increasing  from million at december  to million at december  this increase in the deferred 
table of contents revenue balance is due to an increase in support renewals due to a higher percentage of customers renewing their annual maintenance  partially offset by a decrease in deferred government grant revenue as the government completed its audits in and we were able to recognize the remaining million government grant revenue previously held in deferred revenue 
contractual obligations and commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments of approximately million as shown in the table below 
the table below excludes obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligation long term sublease deposits total operating lease commitments shown above  which are net of contractual sublease agreements  include million of operating lease commitments under leases for vacated facilities which were recorded as accrued restructuring expenses in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  this million lease commitment is net of million in contractual sublease income 
the purchase obligation represents a software license purchase agreement we entered into before december  we do not have any material commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such arrangements  except as disclosed below in the section entitled credit facilities with silicon valley bank 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  vitria did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often refereed to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
credit facilities with silicon valley bank we have a million revolving line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at the bank s prime rate of interest 
the facility is secured by all of vitria s assets 
the agreement includes restrictive covenants which require us to maintain  among other things  a minimum cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance of million 
as part of this million balance  the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum of million in investments which are invested through silicon valley bank 
the line of credit serves as collateral for letters of credit and other commitments  even though these items do not constitute draws on the line of credit 
available advances under the line of credit are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and other commitments 
as of december   we had not borrowed against this line of credit 
in connection with the line of credit agreement  we have outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to certain office leases at december  
table of contents stock repurchase program in july  our board of directors announced a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to an aggregate of five million shares of our common stock beginning on july  and expiring on july  as of december    shares had been repurchased in the open market at a total cost of approximately  the repurchases were funded from available working capital 
no shares were repurchased during the year ended december  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements estimated future uses of cash over the next twelve months are primarily to fund operations and to a lesser extent to fund capital expenditures 
for the next twelve months  we expect to fund these uses from available cash balances  cash generated from operations  if any  and interest on available cash and investment balances 
our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to sell our products and services and generate revenue  as well as our ability to manage our operating costs 
in turn  our ability to sell our products is dependent upon both the economic climate and the competitive factors of the marketplace in which we operate 
in the past  we have invested significantly in our operations 
we intend to continue to invest selectively in sales  marketing and research and development 
in addition  for the next year  we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we expect our capital expenditures in the next year to be approximately million 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or products lines 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
we believe our success requires expanding our customer base and continuing to enhance our vitria businessware products 
our revenues  operating results and cash flows depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenues in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results and cash flows 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
revenues from contracts that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements for which we have been paid or have a valid receivable are recorded as deferred revenues 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue during the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
our future operating results and cash flows will depend on many factors  including the following size and timing of customer orders and product and service delivery  level of demand for our professional services  changes in the mix of our products and services  ability to protect our intellectual property  actions taken by our competitors  including new product introductions and pricing changes  costs of maintaining and expanding our operations  
table of contents introduction of new products  timing of our development and release of new and enhanced products  costs and timing of hiring qualified personnel  success in maintaining and enhancing existing relationships and developing new relationships with system integrators  technological changes in our markets  including changes in standards for computer and networking software and hardware  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of product enhancements or new products  delays in our ability to recognize revenue as a result of the decision by our customers to postpone software delivery  or because of changes in the timing of when delivery of products or services is completed  customer budget cycles and changes in these budget cycles  external economic conditions  availability of customer funds for software purchases given external economic factors  costs related to acquisition of technologies or businesses  ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  changes in strategy and capability of our competitors  and liquidity and timeliness of payments from international customers 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decline

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward 
table of contents looking statements for the reasons described under the caption risks associated with vitria s business and future operating results 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported  as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
unrealized gains and losses at december  were not material 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
there has been no material change in our interest rate exposure since december  the table below presents the principal amount of related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio 
short term investments are all in fixed rate instruments and have maturities of one year or less 
table of investment securities in thousands as of december weighted weighted average interest average interest fair value rate fair value rate cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and investment securities foreign exchange risk as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non us dollar denominated currencies  receivables  and inter company receivables or payables with our foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  we provide funding to our foreign subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures outstanding during the period 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts help to mitigate the gains and losses on our outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net 
we had no outstanding forward contracts as of december  
table of contents risks associated with vitria s business and future operating results our operating results fluctuate significantly and an unanticipated decline in revenue may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price is likely to decline 
period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenues in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
our quarterly results depend primarily upon entering into new or follow on contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
our operating results are also dependent upon our ability to manage our cost structure 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since inception and we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable in the future 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception as we funded the development of our products and the growth of our organization 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  since the beginning of  we have reduced our workforce by a total of employees and consolidated certain facilities as part of our restructuring plan 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million in and million in despite these measures in order to remain competitive we intend to continue investing heavily in sales  marketing and research and development 
as a result  we may report future operating losses and cannot guarantee whether we will report net income in the future 
our operating results are substantially dependent on license revenues from essentially one product  vitria businessware and our business could be materially harmed by factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for vitria businessware 
since  a majority of our total revenues has been  and is expected to be  derived from the license of our vitria businessware product and for applications built using that product 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for vitria businessware by existing and future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to vitria businessware in performance or price  or we fail to enhance vitria businessware and introduce new products in a timely manner  demand for our product may decline 
a decline in demand for vitria businessware as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would significantly reduce our revenues 
we experienced a decrease in our average deal size in due to downward pricing pressure on our base vitria businessware software offering as more companies are offering products in our general marketplace 
the decrease in total number of orders can be attributed to both the increased number of competitors in our markets as well as overall maturation of the marketplace as a whole 
the general slowdown in information technology spending in our target markets due to slow us economic growth has also made it more difficult to grow our revenues 

table of contents failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenues 
during  we had a net loss of million and our operating activities used million of cash 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital  and million in long term liabilities 
we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things develop or enhance our products and services  acquire technologies  products or businesses  expand operations  in the united states or internationally  hire  train and retain employees  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenues and could seriously harm our business 
the challenging economic environment in the united states and abroad  and especially the continued reluctance of companies to make significant expenditures on information technology  could reduce demand for our products and cause our revenues to continue to decline 
the downturn in the us and the world economy may cause a further decline in capital allocations for software purchases 
the delay in capital expenditures may cause a decrease in sales  may cause an increase in our accounts receivable and may make collection of license and support payments from our customers more difficult 
over approximately the past two years  we have experienced a general slow down in the level of capital spending by some of our customers due to the general economic downturn  which has resulted in lower revenues 
this slow down in capital spending  if sustained in future periods  could result in reduced sales or the postponement of sales to our customers 
there can be no assurance that the level of spending on information technology in general  or on business integration software by our customers and potential customers  will increase or remain at current levels in future periods 
lower spending on information technology could result in reduced license sales to our customers  reduced overall revenues  diminished margin levels  and could impair our operating results in future periods 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our products are often used by our customers to deploy mission critical solutions used throughout their organization 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including product benefits  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
many customers will be addressing these issues for the first time 
as a result  we or other parties  including system integrators  must educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our product and services 
in addition  the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
this commitment often requires significant technical review  assessment of competitive products  and approval at a number of management levels within the customer s organization 
because of these issues  our sales cycle has ranged from six to nine months  and in some cases even longer  and it is very difficult to predict whether and when any particular license transaction might be completed 
in addition  the downturn in the us economy has caused some customers to increase budgetary controls or require additional management approvals within the customers organization prior to committing to significant capital purchases  either of which could result in an increased sales cycle 

table of contents because a small number of customers have in the past accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in the fiscal year ended december  our license agreements do not generally provide for ongoing license payments 
therefore  we expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability  breadth and depth of our products  and cost effectiveness of our products 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our product and services would reduce our future revenues 
if we are not successful in developing industry specific solutions based on vitria businessware  our ability to increase future revenues could be harmed 
we have developed and intend to continue to develop solutions based on vitria businessware which incorporate business processes  connectivity and document transformations specific to the needs of particular industries  including the telecommunications  manufacturing supply chain  financial services  insurance and healthcare industries 
this presents technical and sales challenges and requires collaboration with third parties  including system integrators and standard organizations  and the commitment of significant resources 
specific industries may experience economic downturns or regulatory changes that may result in delayed spending decisions by customers or require changes to our products 
if we are not successful in developing these targeted solutions or these solutions do not achieve market acceptance  our ability to increase future revenues could be harmed 
to date we have concentrated our sales and marketing efforts toward companies in the telecommunications  manufacturing  financial services  energy  insurance and healthcare industries 
customers in these vertical markets are likely to have different requirements and may require us to change our product design or features  sales methods  support capabilities or pricing policies 
if we fail to successfully address these vertical markets we may experience decreased sales in future periods 
our products may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenues to decline 
deployment of our products requires interoperability with a variety of software applications and systems and  in some cases  the ability to process a high number of transactions per second 
if our products fail to satisfy these demanding technological objectives  our customers will be dissatisfied and we may be unable to generate future sales 
failure to establish a significant base of customer references will significantly reduce our ability to license our product to additional customers 
our markets are highly competitive and  if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the market for our products and solutions is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition is expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenues 
our current and potential competitors include adp  ascential software  bea  ccms  csc  ibm corporation  iona  landacorp  mckesson  meddecision  microsoft corporation  netik  pegasystems  proxymed  quovadx  seebeyond technology  sungard  sybase  tibco software  trizetto  vips  wedmd  webmethods and others 
in the future  some of these companies may expand their products to provide or enhance existing business process management  business analysis and monitoring  and business vocabulary management functionality  as well as integration solutions for specific business problems 
these or other competitors may merge to attempt the creation of a more competitive entity  or one that offers a broader solution than we provide 
in addition  in house information technology departments of potential customers have developed or may develop systems that provide for some or all of the functionality of our products 
we expect that internally developed application integration and process 
table of contents automation efforts will continue to be a principal source of competition for the foreseeable future 
in particular  it can be difficult to sell our product to a potential customer whose internal development group has already made large investments in and progress towards completion of systems that our product is intended to replace 
finally  we also face direct and indirect competition from major enterprise software developers that offer integration products as a complement to their other enterprise software products 
these companies may also modify their applications to be more easily integrated with other applications through web services or other means 
some of these vendors include oracle  peoplesoft  siebel systems and sap ag 
many of our competitors have more resources and broader customer and partner relationships than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
although we believe that our solutions generally compete favorably with respect to these factors  our market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater resources 
our revenues will likely decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with system integrators 
system integrators install and deploy our products and those of our competitors  and perform custom integration of systems and applications 
some system integrators engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing  and implementation and support of our product than we would otherwise have to  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of the system integrators 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these firms for recommendations of our product during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
a number of our competitors have strong relationships with these system integrators and  as a result  these system integrators may recommend competitors products and services 
in addition  a number of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these system integrators and  therefore  have access to a broader base of enterprise customers 
our failure to establish or maintain these relationships would significantly harm our ability to license and successfully implement our software product 
in addition  we rely on the industry expertise and reach of these firms 
therefore  this failure would also harm our ability to develop industry specific products 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and maintain these relationships 
our operating results could be harmed if these efforts do not generate license and service revenues necessary to offset this investment 
the cost and difficulty in implementing our product could significantly harm our reputation with customers  diminishing our ability to license additional products to our customers 
our products are often purchased as part of large projects undertaken by our customers 
these projects are complex  time consuming and expensive 
failure by customers to successfully deploy our products  or the failure by us or third party consultants to ensure customer satisfaction  could damage our reputation with existing and future customers and reduce future revenues 
in many cases  our customers must interact with  modify  or replace significant elements of their existing computer systems 
the costs of our products and services represent only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and consulting costs 
the significant involvement of third parties  including system integrators  reduces the control we have over the implementation of our products and the quality of customer service provided to organizations which license our software 
if our products do not operate with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers  our business may fail 
we currently serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  packaged software applications and networking platforms 
if our products fail to gain broad market acceptance  due to 
table of contents their inability to support a variety of these platforms  our operating results may suffer 
our business depends  among others  on the following factors our ability to integrate our product with multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our products as new versions of packaged applications are introduced  the portability of our products  particularly the number of operating systems and databases that our products can source or target  our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet standards  the integration of additional software modules under development with our existing products  and our management of software being developed by third parties for our customers or use with our products 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of our products in a timely manner  our revenues may decline 
we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis  if at all 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of our vitria businessware products 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenues 
if new releases or products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  we could experience a delay or loss of revenues and cause customer dissatisfaction 
in addition  customers may delay purchases of our products in anticipation of future releases 
if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our revenues may decline 
our products rely on third party programming tools and applications 
if we lose access to these tools and applications  or are unable to modify our products in response to changes in these tools and applications  our revenues could decline 
our programs utilize java programming technology provided by sun microsystems 
we also depend upon access to the interfaces  known as apis  used for communication between external software products and packaged application software 
our access to apis of third party applications are controlled by the providers of these applications 
if the application provider denies or delays our access to apis  our business may be harmed 
some application providers may become competitors or establish alliances with our competitors  increasing the likelihood that we would not be granted access to their apis 
we also license technology related to the connectivity of our product to third party database and other applications and we incorporate some third party technology into our product offerings 
loss of the ability to use this technology  delays in upgrades  failure of these third parties to support these technologies  or other difficulties with our third party technology partners could lead to delays in product shipment and could cause our revenues to decline 
we could suffer losses and negative publicity if new versions and releases of our products contain errors or defects 
our products and their interactions with customers software applications and it systems are complex and  accordingly  there may be undetected errors or failures when products are introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction which has resulted in additional research and development expenses 
to date  these additional expenses have not been material 
we may in the future discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
since many customers are using our products for mission critical business operations  any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business and generate negative publicity 

table of contents if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we depend on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
none of these persons are bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of senior management or other key research  development  sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
in addition  we must attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we face significant competition for individuals with the skills required to develop  market and support our products and services 
we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  we may lose these rights and our business may be seriously harmed 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from our competitor s products 
the use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws afford only limited protection 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights 
software developers in our market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products in different software industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  prevent product shipment or cause delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
patent litigation in particular has complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties 
in the event an infringement claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our product to avoid infringement  our business would be harmed 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed to us or are using confidential or proprietary information 
our significant international operations may fail to generate significant product revenues or contribute to our drive toward profitability  which could result in slower revenue growth and harm our business 
we maintain international offices in countries including the united kingdom  japan  germany  france  italy  brazil  korea  mexico  singapore  canada  australia and spain and may establish additional international offices 
during  of our revenue was derived from international markets 
there are a number of challenges to establishing operations outside of the united states and we may be unable to successfully generate significant international revenues 
if we fail to successfully establish our products in international markets  we could experience slower revenue growth and our business could be harmed 
it may be difficult to protect our intellectual property in certain international jurisdictions 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to our expected stock price volatility 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
in november  vitria and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in a class action shareholder 
table of contents complaint 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
see item of part i legal proceedings for more information regarding this litigation 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may also discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of vitria 
in addition  as of december   our executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of vitria and may make some transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders
