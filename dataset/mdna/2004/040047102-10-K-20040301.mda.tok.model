overview our goal is to discover  develop and  ultimately  commercialize novel and improved orally available drugs 
drug discovery and development is a long and uncertain process 
however  we believe our broadly applicable technologies  deep knowledge of g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  and the efficiencies captured through our integrated drug discovery and development platform place us in a leading position to build a sustainable pipeline of drug candidates and to develop unique  high quality drugs 
we focus our drug discovery efforts across gpcr targets and compounds within four therapeutic areas metabolic diseases  central nervous system disorders  cardiovascular diseases  and inflammatory disorders 
we intend to commercialize drugs independently and through collaborations with pharmaceutical partners 
we have retained significant rights to market products that may result from most of our programs 
in  we made significant progress in the development of our internally discovered small molecule compounds for obesity  insomnia and diabetes we successfully completed preclinical testing for our obesity drug candidate  apd  in preparation for the phase clinical trials initiated in february we demonstrated that our insomnia drug candidate  apd  promoted deeper sleep in an established animal model and have now initiated preclinical safety testing in animals 
we confirmed that several of our diabetes compounds successfully controlled plasma glucose or blood sugar levels in widely accepted animal models of diabetes and moved closer to selecting a compound as a drug candidate  which we expect to do this year 
we incorporated in april see why we focus on g protein coupled receptors  our proprietary gpcr technologies and competition below in this section for more scientific background information that may help you to understand our research and technologies and certain scientific terms used in this annual report 
our strategy the key elements of our scientific and business strategy to achieve our objectives are to internally develop drug leads and retain more attractive commercial rights 
we intend to maximize the value of our drug candidates by internally developing many of our drug leads into and through the clinical trial process 
while we have partnered our technologies and programs in the past  we now expect to do so with compounds or drug candidates in later stages of development and  hopefully  on more favorable terms 
build a development platform 
to capitalize on our discoveries  we are transitioning from primarily a discovery research company to a research and development company 
toward this end  we have added to our core expertise in molecular biology and high throughput screening and built internal capabilities in numerous areas  including medicinal chemistry  process chemistry  analytical chemistry  pharmaceutics  drug metabolism  pharmacokinetics  in vivo pharmacology  toxicology  quality assurance  regulatory affairs  project management  and clinical operations 
we have also built supporting infrastructure  including a chemical development facility that will enable us to perform the scale up and manufacture of our lead drug candidates for evaluation in animal pharmacology and toxicology studies  as well as for clinical trials 
we plan to continue to expand our clinical development capability as our drug candidates enter into  and move through  clinical trials 
we believe that having these capabilities in house will help us to more effectively control development of our drug candidates 
develop orally available small molecules 
we will seek to develop drugs that are small molecule compounds that are effective when taken orally 
small molecules are ideally suited for reaching and penetrating body tissues to activate or inhibit gpcrs 
the major commercial advantage of small molecules is that they can be taken orally and are generally less expensive to manufacture than other classes of drugs 
maintain strong research discovery capabilities 
we have used our proprietary constitutively activated receptor technology cart to discover drug like compounds ie  compounds that appear to have the desired characteristics of an orally available drug since we began our research activities 
in  we added to our discovery capabilities by acquiring melanophore technology  which is a simple  robust and widely applicable functional assay technique for identifying compounds that activate or inhibit gpcrs 
through these efforts  we have identified a large number of gpcr targets and novel compounds 
these and other discoveries will fuel our pipeline  and we intend to continue to use financial resources to further our early research efforts 
focus on gpcrs and diseases representing attractive market opportunities 
gpcrs are one of the most drugable targets in the human body and play a role in diseases in each of our four therapeutic areas of focus 
our drug discovery efforts will generally target diseases that we believe represent attractive commercial opportunities that are not being satisfied by existing treatments 
shortcomings of currently available drugs may include side effects  limited efficacy or difficulty of compliance or method of delivery 
our research development programs 
gbaimagejpg 
metabolic diseases obesity obesity and metabolic syndrome affect tens of millions of adults and children and pose a serious long term threat to their health and welfare 
medical treatments for obesity and metabolic syndrome are currently limited 
however  a number of companies have active research programs in this area 
we have identified various gpcrs that we believe regulate food intake and weight 
our drug discovery efforts are directed to identifying novel drug candidates targeting gpcrs in the central nervous system cns and peripheral tissues that may act to reduce fat mass in people 
in this regard  we have identified both known and orphan gpcrs expressed in the hypothalamus  which is an area of the brain known to be critical for regulating satiety and metabolism 
clinical program apd in february  we initiated a phase clinical trial on our obesity drug candidate apd apd selectively stimulates the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor  a gpcr located in the hypothalamus 
our in vivo experiments have shown that apd reduces body weight and food intake in animal models of obesity 
our in vivo experiments have also shown that apd also reduces fat mass in obese animals  but leaves lean body mass unchanged  which is the desired outcome 
further  these same animals had a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol  while their hdl  the so called good cholesterol  increased 
other obesity programs 
in addition to apd and other compounds that act on the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor  we have discovery programs focused on several different gpcrs 
we have identified early lead compounds in three of these programs  and have discovered orally active small molecules that reduce food intake and body weight in our animal models of obesity 
diabetes diabetes is a major worldwide disease approaching epidemic proportions 
according to the international diabetes foundation  there are million adults with diabetes worldwide  of which the vast majority have type ii diabetes  the adult onset form of the disease 
type ii diabetes is characterized by either the body not making enough insulin in response to changes in plasma glucose or the body s inability to respond to insulin 
type i diabetes is characterized by the body producing little or no insulin 
while treatment of type i diabetes typically involves injections of insulin  treatment of type ii diabetes may not 
over million of these adults with diabetes are located in north america and europe 
current therapies for diabetes have side effects  including hypoglycemia and weight gain 
we are working on a series of orphan gpcr targets to develop orally available therapies to treat types i and ii diabetes 
lead program aj 
one gpcr  aj formerly referred to as islet gpcr  is highly expressed in pancreatic islet beta cells  the cells responsible for insulin production 
we have discovered orally available small molecules that stimulate the release of insulin from beta cells  which  in turn  controls plasma glucose levels in animals 
we plan to designate a lead compound for preclinical development this year 
other diabetes programs 
in addition to aj  we are focusing our discovery efforts on approximately known and orphan gpcr targets that we believe regulate important mechanisms involved in glucose control 
for example  we are conducting research with receptors that may act to regulate glucose uptake  glucose absorption  insulin secretion and production of glucose in the liver 
central nervous system disorders sleep disorders sleep disorders pose a major societal problem and most adults experience difficulty with sleep at some time during their lives 
currently marketed therapies are effective at initiating sleep  but they have shortcomings  including the risk of developing tolerance to the drug and the potential for causing a sensation of dullness and lethargy upon awakening the so called hangover effect 
we have discovered a series of compounds that act through a different receptor target than current drugs on the market 
we believe that our compounds may have fewer shortcomings then these drugs due in part to this difference 
others are testing drugs in the clinic that act through the same receptor that our compounds target 
preclinical program apd our lead compound  apd  selectively inhibits the ht 
a 
serotonin receptor and in animal studies increased non rem sleep  the most restorative phase of the sleep cycle in humans 
depression and anxiety the majority of available treatments for depressive disorders target the serotonin or norepinephrine transporter site in the brain 
the clinical efficacy of these therapeutics is typically delayed by days to weeks after treatment onset and these drugs are limited by other side effects  especially sexual dysfunction 
we are developing small molecules targeting a gpcr which act through a different mechanism than serotonin and or norepinephrine  and have confirmed that inhibitors of this gpcr show activity in animal models of depression and anxiety 
neurodegeneration over three million people in the world suffer from parkinson s disease  a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine producing neurons in the brain 
we have identified a novel orphan gpcr  x  that may act to amplify the dopamine system in the brain and we are developing small molecules as potential novel therapeutics 
cardiovascular diseases our focus in the cardiovascular area includes thrombosis and heart failure 
thrombosis bleeding is the major side effect that limits the use of currently available anti platelet therapies 
we are working on platelet gpcrs that are involved in thrombosis  or blood clotting 
in particular  we have identified several small molecules that inhibit platelet gpcrs that attenuate thrombosis in disease settings without triggering bleeding 
we have successfully identified several small molecule candidates and are in the process of obtaining efficacy and bleeding profiles in animal models 
heart failure acute myocardial infarction  which is commonly known as a heart attack  followed by heart failure is a direct consequence of atherosclerosis and remains a major cause of death 
we have identified certain gpcrs that we believe play a major role in these processes and are identifying small molecules directed at these gpcr targets that could provide cardioprotection following myocardial infarction and therapeutic benefit during heart failure 
inflammatory disorders we are developing small molecule therapeutics that target gpcrs involved in the inflammatory process 
tumor necrosis factor alpha  or tnf  is an important pro inflammatory mediator in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
current therapeutics  such as anti tnf antibodies  that function to inhibit the activity of tnf have proven successful in clinical applications 
one such well known successful biologic that inhibits tnf is embrel 
however  these approaches are restricted to intravenous or subcutaneous administration routes due to the lack of absorption of these biological molecules after oral administration 
we have discovered small molecule compounds which can be orally administered and that act to target gpcrs in the immune system to inhibit the production of tnf 
we plan to test the efficacy of these molecules in animal models of inflammatory diseases  such as arthritis  in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis and asthma are initiated and exacerbated by an aberrant inflammatory response 
immune cells such as eosinophils  neutrophils  mast cells and specific t cell subsets play a role in these diseases 
we have identified gpcrs that are found in these immune cell types and that mediate the inflammatory process 
we are continuing to apply our screening technologies to these gpcr targets to identify small molecules that could activate or inhibit these gpcrs and  in turn  mediate the inflammatory process 
why we focus on g protein coupled receptors most drugs work by binding to a particular target in the body  thereby altering communication between cells or otherwise regulating cellular activity 
many diseases and disorders result because of abnormalities in this communication process 
in general  the goal of receptor based drugs is to interact with the receptor or with the signaling molecule the ligand found in the body that naturally binds to that receptor  thereby inhibiting or activating the activities in the body mediated by that receptor 
we are focusing on gpcrs for the following reasons first  gpcrs are a class of receptors that mediate the majority of cell to cell communication within humans 
second  gpcrs are pharmaceutically important because small molecules can be developed that modulate the activity of gpcrs with a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity 
in addition  expression of many gpcrs is restricted to specific areas of the body  thereby allowing us to develop gpcr based drugs that may have fewer side effects 
a high percentage of today s prescription drugs target one or more gpcrs  with most major therapeutic areas served to some extent by a number of gpcr based drugs 
we believe that no single class of genes ranks higher than gpcrs in terms of drug discovery potential 
third  the gpcr family is large  and the functions of many gpcrs are still unknown or incompletely understood 
based on the percentage of gpcrs found in other organisms  the number of gpcrs in the human genome has been estimated to be as many as  searching for gpcrs within the recently determined sequence of the human genome has resulted in the identification of approximately gpcrs 
about of these are categorized as known gpcrs because their naturally occurring  or native  ligands have been identified 
the super family of gpcrs is subdivided into three major gpcr sub families based on sequence similarity and the pharmacological nature of their ligands 
this includes the class i  or rhodopsin like  gpcrs  the class ii  or secretin like  gpcrs  and the class iii  or metabotropic glutamate like  gpcrs  which represent about  and of the known gpcrs  respectively 
fourth  today s clinically successful gpcr based drugs have targeted about of the approximately known gpcrs  predominantly in the biogenic amine family  a sub family of class i gpcrs 
however  molecular cloning efforts in combination with the sequencing of the human genome have afforded the opportunity to identify both additional receptor subtypes of known gpcrs and novel gpcrs 
these novel gpcrs are categorized as orphan gpcrs because their native ligands remain to be identified 
orphan gpcrs offer great promise for the development of novel gpcr based therapeutics and are a major focus of our research 
fifth  as described below  we have technologies that allow us to identify novel and improved therapeutics at known and orphan gpcrs 
our proprietary gpcr technologies cart traditional ligand based drug screening methods require the identification and use of the receptor s native ligand to discover small molecule compounds that will bind at or close to the native ligand s binding site on the receptor 
researchers using these methods search for small molecules that bind at or close to the native ligand binding site to prevent the native ligand from interacting with the cell  thereby influencing cellular communication 
traditional gpcr research  therefore  is focused initially on identifying the native ligand 
in contrast  we have a technology that does not require the use of the native ligand 
instead  we are able to genetically alter the intracellular portion of the gpcr or otherwise activate the gpcr so that the g protein signals without the presence of the native ligand 
we call this technology constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart 
cart allows us to discover drug like compounds by activating the gpcr to mimic the biological response that occurs when the native ligand binds to the receptor 
therefore  cart avoids a major bottleneck in drug discovery efforts at orphan receptors by eliminating the step of first identifying the native ligand 
cart also facilitates drug discovery at known receptors  as discussed below 
cart can be applied broadly to gpcrs because all gpcrs have highly similar structural elements  consisting of three extracellular loops  three intracellular loops  and seven regions that cross through the cell membrane and connect the extracellular and intracellular loops 
under normal physiological conditions  a gpcr exists in equilibrium between an inactive state and an active state 
when a gpcr s equilibrium shifts to an active state  the gpcr is able to act through ie  couple to a g protein  thereby eliciting a biological response 
when a gpcr s equilibrium shifts to an inactive state  the receptor is typically unable to couple to a g protein and is  therefore  unable to elicit a biological response 
when a native ligand binds to the gpcr  the gpcr s equilibrium shifts and the gpcr is stabilized in the active state 
by altering the genetic structure of a gpcr  cart stabilizes the gpcr in the active state in the absence of the native ligand 
drug screening and discovery targeting gpcrs using cart is comprised of four stages activating the gpcr to generate a cart activated form of the gpcr  introducing the cart activated form of the receptor into cells  which in turn express the cart activated form of these gpcrs at the cell surface  analyzing the cells expressing the cart activated gpcr to detect biological responses that result from the coupling of the cart activated gpcr to a g protein  and screening chemical libraries of small molecule compounds against the cart activated gpcr to identify compounds that interact with the gpcr 
screening using cart allows us to simultaneously identify drug leads that act as receptor activators or agonists  which increase the detected biological response  or act as receptor inhibitors  which decrease the detected response 
we can also identify inverse agonists  which inhibit ligand independent  as well as ligand dependent  receptor activity 
inverse agonist are the preferred drugs for treating diseases in which ligand independent receptor activity may be important  such as schizophrenia 
we believe the inverse agonists we identify may possess improved pharmacological properties over neutral antagonists because inverse agonists inhibit both ligand dependent and ligand independent activity  whereas neutral antagonists inhibit only ligand dependent activity 
in addition  because cart does not require use of the native ligand  we are not restricted to identifying compounds that bind to a gpcr at the binding site for the native ligand 
instead  cart exposes the entire gpcr surface to potential drug leads  allowing for the detection of drug leads that may bind anywhere on the receptor surface 
we believe that this feature of cart is important not only with respect to orphan gpcrs  but also with respect to known receptors as well  because this feature provides us the ability to discover new drugs with novel mechanisms of action 
in summary  we believe that cart offers several key advantages for drug discovery over other screening techniques 
screening cart activated gpcrs does not require prior identification of the native ligand for an orphan receptor  enhances the detection of  and allows us to simultaneously identify  both receptor inhibitor and receptor activator drug leads  allows for the identification of drug leads that inhibit both ligand dependent and ligand independent activity  and provides the ability to discover novel and improved therapeutics directed at known receptors 
melanophore technology our patented melanophore technology is a broadly applicable high throughput screen for gpcrs 
when a gpcr is activated either by a ligand or ligand independently through cart  the gpcr couples to one or more g proteins  including those belonging to the gs  gq  and gi o classes 
melanophore technology can detect gpcrs that couple to all major g protein classes 
our melanophore technology is  therefore  ideal for studies of orphan receptors whose coupling parameters are unknown 
melanophores are amphibian cells that are responsible for skin color 
each melanophore cell has numerous cytoplasmic organelles called melanosomes 
melanosomes contain the dark pigment melanin 
the distribution of this pigment determines whether a cell appears light or dark 
when melanosomes are clustered or aggregated at a single central intracellular location  the melanophore is light in color 
when the melanosomes are dispersed evenly throughout the melanophore  the melanophore is dark in color 
light color results from the activation of gi or go classes  while dark color results from the activation of gs or gq classes 
receptor activity can be easily determined with both video imaging and standard microplate readers 
melanophore technology provides us with a robust means for identifying gpcr agonists  antagonists and inverse agonists 
unlike other gpcr assays such as those involving fluorescence  luminescence  visual dyes or reporter genes  the color change in melanophores is fully and rapidly reversible  enabling direct reading of inverse agonist activity at gpcrs 
project genesis last year  we substantially completed our efforts under project genesis  a program directed at identifying human gpcrs  determining where these gpcrs are expressed in normal and diseased tissues to better understand their possible therapeutic relevance  using our cart and melanophore technologies to screen these gpcrs against our chemical libraries to identify small molecules that interact with these gpcrs  and applying medicinal chemistry to further develop the small molecules identified through screening 
through project genesis  we have learned  among other things  where and how gpcrs function in the body and how they interact with the small molecule chemicals that modulate their activity 
we believe that this knowledge will allow us to rationally and more efficiently move our therapeutic programs forward 
research and development expenses research and development activities are the primary source of our expenses and personnel costs  research supplies  facility and equipment costs and preclinical study fees 
research expenses related to the development and improvement of our technology and drug candidates totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  included in these numbers is research that was sponsored by our collaborators 
we estimate that research sponsored by our collaborators totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  corporate collaborations we have entered into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to discover and develop novel drug leads using our gpcr technologies 
we intend to continue to pursue such collaborations in an effort to access their research  drug development  manufacturing  marketing and financial resources 
our most significant collaborator is merck co  inc  one of the world s leading pharmaceutical companies 
in october  we entered into a research and licensing agreement with merck to collaborate on validating and developing therapeutics at three gpcrs of interest to merck and that may play a role in cardiovascular disease 
under the collaboration  we received an upfront payment of million 
we also received  and expect to continue to receive through at least the end of this year  research funding from merck under this agreement 
this agreement provides for preclinical milestones of up to million 
in february  we achieved the first of these preclinical milestone for which we were paid million 
in addition to preclinical milestones  we may receive milestones for merck s clinical and marketing achievements  if any  of up to million and royalty payments associated with merck s commercialization of drugs discovered under the agreement  if any 
there is no guarantee we will receive any further milestone payments or royalty payments under this agreement 
other collaborators we worked with in included eli lilly and company  taisho pharmaceutical co  ltd  fujisawa pharmaceutical  co  ltd  taigen biotechnology co  ltd  and ferring pharmaceuticals  inc please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of our collaborations  including financial information  activities being conducted and termination provisions 
database we have developed a web based database that can be used to access relevant information and data generated from our research and development programs 
our database allows individual users to obtain information on specific gpcr targets  including gene sequence information  chemical structures  data developed by us from gpcr tissues and cellular distribution studies  the results of drug screening and the results of our animal studies 
in developing this database  we focused on the magnitude of data that we would generate based upon the number of gpcrs available to us  and the number of chemical compounds that would be screened in our assays 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements  licensing agreements and other agreements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as of february   we own or have exclusively licensed the following patents in the united states  in european countries  three in australia  and two in new zealand 
in addition  as of february   we have more than patent applications before the united states patent and trademark office  foreign patent offices and international patent authorities 
these patents and patent applications are directed to cart  melanophore technology  chemical compositions of matter  methods of treatment using chemical compositions  or gpcr genes 
there is no assurance that any of these patent applications will issue  or that any of the patents will be enforceable or cover a drug product or other commercially significant product or method 
except for the united states patents relating to our melanophore technology  the term of all of our other current patents commenced  and our future patents  if any  will commence  on the date of issuance and terminate years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application 
since our united states melanophore patents were issued under now superceded rules that provided a patent term of years from the date of issuance  the term of these patents are scheduled to end in  more than years after their earliest filing date 
because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology patent applications is often more than three years  the resulting term of our pending patent applications  if any  on our products and technologies may be substantially less than years 
in the united states  patent term extensions are available for certain delays in patent office proceedings and united states food and drug administration fda approval 
however  due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions  there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or fda approval 
we seek patent protection for our key inventions  including clinical candidates and drug leads we identify  routes for chemical synthesis  cart  new receptors that we discover and genetically altered receptors 
it has been possible to obtain broad  composition of matter patents on novel chemical compounds  such as the drug leads 
it has also been possible to obtain broad method patents for techniques and procedures for screening and drug identification technologies 
it has generally been more difficult to obtain broad composition of matter patents for nucleic acid and amino acid sequences 
however  it has been possible to obtain patents that protect specific sequences and functional equivalents of those sequences 
furthermore  intellectual property law allows for separate and distinct patents for novel  altered genetic sequences that have improved properties over previously disclosed sequences 
we believe that we can obtain patents on certain of our cart activated receptor sequences because they are not functional equivalents of the natural version of the receptor 
we expect to continue to develop other means of activating gpcrs for drug screening and to file patent applications 
as a general matter  obtaining patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields is highly uncertain and involves complex legal  scientific and factual matters 
obtaining a patent in the united states in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields is expensive and can  and often does  require several years to complete 
failure to receive patents pursuant to the applications referred to herein and any future applications could be harmful to us 
our patent filings in the united states may be subject to interference or reexamination proceedings 
the defense and prosecution of interference and reexamination proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states involve complex legal and factual questions 
we also file patent applications outside of the united states 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of our patents in foreign countries by way of opposition proceedings 
additionally  if an opposition proceeding is initiated against any of our patent filings in a foreign country  that proceeding could have an adverse effect on the corresponding patents or pending patent applications in the united states 
if we become involved in any interference  reexamination  opposition or litigation proceedings in the united states or foreign countries regarding patent or other proprietary rights  those proceedings may result in substantial cost to us  regardless of the outcome  and may have a material adverse affect on our ability to develop  manufacture  market or license our technologies or products  or to maintain or form strategic alliances 
in march  we became aware that the japanese patent office had issued a notification of reasons for revocation of our japanese patent on our melanophore technology 
this is a proceeding to seek to invalidate our japanese patent 
we are currently opposing this revocation 
although we plan to aggressively prosecute our patent applications and defend our patents against third party infringement  we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that  if issued  such patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our patents  to the extent they are or will be issued  will provide us protection against competitors with other technologies 
our technologies and potential products may conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors  universities or others 
as the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued  the risk increases that our technologies and potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents of others 
third parties claiming infringement of their proprietary rights could bring legal actions against us seeking damages and to enjoin our use or commercialization of a product or our use of a technology 
in particular  patent applications or patents for innovative and broadly applicable technologies  such as cart  are sometimes challenged by third parties  and held invalid by the courts 
we cannot assure you that such challenges will not be brought against us in the future 
if any of these challenges is successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to use a technology or to manufacture or market a product  or could be required to cease using those products or technologies 
any claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts and attention of our scientific and management personnel 
we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any patent would be made available or would be made available on acceptable terms 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information  all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement  laboratory notebook policy  and invention disclosure protocol  as a condition of employment 
additionally  our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement requires that our employees not bring to arena  or use without proper authorization  any third party proprietary technology 
we also require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us 
while such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf  they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change 
we face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing the same or similar technologies 
we also face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing drugs that would compete with the products we are developing 
we may not be able to compete successfully against this competition  which includes many large and more heavily financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies 
the focus of our scientific and business strategy is gpcrs 
most pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies have drug discovery programs based on gpcrs 
in addition  other companies have attempted to overcome the problems associated with traditional drug screening by embarking on a variety of alternative strategies 
developments by others may render our drug candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial  scientific and marketing resources than we do 
additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors 
as a result  our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research  development  marketing and promotion of drug discovery techniques or therapeutic products  or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval or commercializing products before we do 
we expect to encounter significant competition for the principal pharmaceutical products we are developing  including our lead drug candidate for obesity  apd companies that complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage 
furthermore  we will be competing against companies with substantially greater manufacturing  marketing  distributing and selling capabilities  and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use 
we may rely on our collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of products 
our collaborators may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us  which may negatively impact the development of drugs that they discover which are subject to our agreements 
generally  our agreements with our collaborators also do not preclude them from pursuing development efforts in one or more therapeutic areas of interest in which we have internal development efforts ongoing 
in addition  we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaborative arrangements  and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships 
government regulation we plan to develop and commercialize selected drug candidates by ourselves and license other candidates to partners for further development and commercialization 
our and our collaborator s on going drug development activities are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the united states and other countries in which these products may be tested or marketed 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy and uncertain 
before marketing in the united states  any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
moreover  the fda imposes substantial requirements on new product research and the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products  including testing and clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of these products 
in the united states  we are also subject to other federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including regulation of the use and care of laboratory animals 
in addition  the state of california imposes licensing requirements on facilities manufacturing drugs for clinical trials for commercial marketing 
governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing  approval and marketing  including in the united kingdom the uk  which is where we are currently conducting a clinical trial on apd specifically  in the european union the eu  of which the uk is a member state  a new clinical trials directive a ctd goes into effect on may  under current uk regulations  a filing to the competent regulatory authority is not required to conduct a phase clinical trial in healthy subjects 
however  under the new directive  phase clinical trials in healthy subjects  as well as later clinical trials  will require the filing of a clinical trials authorization a cta to the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency the mhra the equivalent of the fda in the united kingdom 
our current study on apd may not be completed prior to the may  deadline 
any ongoing clinical trials that are active on may   will be subject to the terms of the new directive  and we are taking steps to be compliant with the new directive for apd further  this new law also imposes new inspection requirements for clinical trials and for facilities manufacturing clinical trials materials 
before commencing clinical investigations in humans in the united states  we and or our collaborators must submit an investigational new drug  or ind  application to the fda 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase represents the initial administration of the drug to a small group of humans  either healthy volunteers or patients  to test for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  excretion and clinical pharmacology 
phase involves studies in patients to begin to assess the effectiveness of the product  to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse effects 
once a drug is found to have some effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population  phase studies are initiated to establish safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical study sites 
the fda may require further post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies 
the fda reviews both the clinical plans and the results of the trials and we  our collaborators or the fda may decide that clinical trials should be discontinued at any time if any significant safety issues are identified 
clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board or ethics committee oversight  informed consent  good clinical practices and other fda or other regulatory authority oversight 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and is difficult to predict 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
additional factors that may cause delay  termination or increased cost of our or our collaborators clinical trials include  among other factors slow patient enrollment in the clinical trials the eligibility criteria for the study competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate lack of effectiveness of the product being tested adverse medical effects or side effects in treated patients inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring the clinical trial delays in approval from a study site s institutional review board longer treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or to determine the appropriate product dose if preclinical and clinical studies are successful  the results  together with other information about the product and its manufacture  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application  or nda  to request marketing approval 
before receiving fda approval to market a product  we or our collaborators must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective through clinical trials on the patient population that will be treated 
the approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
additional animal studies or clinical trials may be requested during the fda review period that may delay marketing approval 
as part of the approval process  each manufacturing facility must be inspected by the fda 
among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform with federally mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
both before and after approval  manufacturers must expend time  money and effort to ensure compliance with cgmps  and the fda conducts periodic inspections to certify such compliance 
violations may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market  or other enforcement action 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted by the fda  this approval will be limited to those specific conditions for which the product is approved  as demonstrated through clinical studies 
after fda approval for the initial indications  further clinical trials will be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited 
the fda requires that adverse effects be reported to the fda and may also require post marketing testing to monitor for adverse effects  which can involve significant expense 
even after fda approvals are obtained  a marketed product is subject to continual review 
later discovery of previously unknown information or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restriction on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions 
furthermore  failure to obtain reimbursement coverage from governmental or third party insurers may adversely impact successful commercialization 
we have a chemical development facility that we are using for process research  the scale up and production of intermediates and other compounds for research and development purposes  and the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients 
we are completing the activities needed to obtain the applicable manufacturing licenses to produce materials in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
us  europe and other regulatory authorities require that clinical and commercial products be manufactured according to cgmp regulations 
in addition  drug manufacturing facilities in the state of california must be inspected and licensed by the california department of health services in compliance with state regulatory requirements 
california law prohibits the shipment of product from a manufacturing facility for any clinical testing or commercial use prior to satisfaction of licensing requirements 
there is no assurance that we will obtain a license  or obtain it in a timely manner 
sources and availability of raw materials in general  we purchase raw materials and supplies on the open market 
substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us 
however  we currently only have two sources of supply for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our lead development project 
the loss of that supply would temporarily delay our lead development project  apd compliance with environmental regulations we are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the controlled substances act and other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
our research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources 
our compliance with these laws and regulations did not  and is not expected to  have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
employees as of february   we employed people  including in research and development and in administration 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating us should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report and in our other public filings before making investment decisions regarding our stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
if apd fails in clinical trials  we may significantly curtail some of our activities we initiated our first clinical trial on an internally discovered compound  which we call apd  in february this trial is being conducted at a contract phase unit in england 
if apd is found to be unsafe in  or not tolerated by  the people we test in our phase clinical trial  we may not be able to raise new financing or generate significant revenue in the next year or two 
in such an event  we may need to significantly curtail some of our current and planned research and development programs 
we have a history of losses and expect our losses to continue we had losses of million for the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit of million from our inception in april through december  our losses have resulted in large part from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and validate new drug targets and compounds that could become marketed drugs 
we expect our operating expenses over the next several years will be significant and that we will continue to have significant operating losses in the near term  even if we or our collaborators are successful in advancing compounds discovered using our technologies 
in addition  losses allocable to our common stockholders will be increased as a result of our recent series b convertible preferred stock financing 
in accordance with eitf  application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  we allocated the total proceeds received in that financing among the series b convertible preferred stock  the warrants and the unit warrants 
the amount we allocated to the warrants and unit warrants was million 
as a result of this allocation  we recorded on our financial statements a deemed dividend of million 
this deemed dividend is based on the value of the common stock underlying the series b convertible preferred stock 
we will record amortization of the value of the warrants  unit warrants and deemed dividend over five years  which will increase the losses allocable to our common stockholders 
we will need additional funds in the future for our research and development  and we may not be able to obtain such funds we cannot sustain our current operating plan for more than the next two or three years unless we obtain additional financing from collaborators or investors 
in addition  it takes substantially more cash than what we currently have to successfully develop a compound into a marketed drug 
financing may not be available  or may not be available on terms that are favorable  to us 
we do not believe that we can currently license our programs or technologies on terms that would significantly reduce the need for us to obtain additional financing from investors 
our strategy is to continue developing these programs and move them towards or into clinical development so that we can achieve better financial terms with a collaborator and  therefore  be able to continue our drug discovery efforts at their current levels 
if our research and development efforts are not successful in the next one or two years  and if we do not receive new financing from investors  we may need to license our programs on financial terms that are unfavorable to us 
any further financing through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity will dilute your investment  and may also include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to yours 
we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt  and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful 
our stock has not performed as well as the stock of many of our peers for some time  and we presently have only one sell side analyst covering our stock 
these factors  and many others  may affect our ability to access capital markets 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we will be required to significantly curtail or eliminate one or more of our drug discovery or development programs  or to completely discontinue our operations 
our largest stockholders may take actions that are contrary to your interests a small number of our stockholders hold a significant amount of our outstanding stock 
these stockholders interests could differ from the interests of other stockholders  and they could be in a position to affect us in a way that is detrimental to the interests of other stockholders 
sales by these stockholders of our common stock could adversely affect the market price for our stock 
in addition  their actions and votes would be important  and possibly determinative  in the event we consider a transaction that requires stockholder approval or in the event a third party makes a tender offer or a hostile take over offer for outstanding shares 
on january   biotechnology value fund  lp  biotechnology value fund ii  lp  bvf investments  lp  bvf partners lp  bvf inc collectively  bvf and investment  llc collectively with bvf  the bvf stockholders reported that they own or control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
our stockholders agreement with the bvf stockholders provides that the bvf stockholders will not  on their own or as part of a larger group  i acquire any of our stock or assets  ii solicit proxies or submit stockholder proposals except as provided in such agreement  or iii engage in any of the actions set forth in paragraphs a through j of item of schedule d  including actions that relate to or would result in any person acquiring or disposing of our securities  any change to our board of directors or management  or a material change to our business or corporate structure 
our stockholders agreement also provides that the bvf stockholders will vote for director nominees recommended by our board of directors and on certain other matters as recommended by our board of directors 
these provisions under the stockholders agreement terminate on december   or earlier if the bvf stockholders and certain related parties beneficially own less than  shares of our common stock 
we believe that the bvf stockholders favor a strategic direction for the company that is different than the one favored by management 
the bvf stockholders have recently sold a large number of our shares 
further sales by the bvf stockholders may have an adverse effect on the near term market price for our stock 
all of our programs are in the early stage of drug discovery and development  and if problems arise in the testing or approval process  our drug development efforts may be delayed or may not be successful we are transitioning from primarily a research company to a research and development company 
the research and development of new medicines is highly uncertain and subject to significant risks 
our most advanced program is in the early stages of drug development 
we do not expect any drugs resulting from our research to be commercially available for many years  if ever 
conducting preclinical and clinical trials takes a long time  typically many years  and failure often occurs 
interim results of trials do not assure final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
in the course of our discovery  preclinical testing and clinical trials  we will rely on third parties  including laboratories  investigators and manufacturers  to perform critical services for us 
for example  we are relying on a european based clinical trial contractor to conduct our phase clinical trials for apd this organization is responsible for many aspects of these trials  including finding and enrolling volunteers for testing and administering the testing 
another example is that we are currently relying on a contract manufacturer to make certain compounds for us 
these third parties may not be available when we need them or  if they are available  may not perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner 
as a result of our dependence on third parties  we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control 
these risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators  and we do not expect any drugs resulting from our collaborators research and development efforts to be commercially available for many years  if ever 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we will not be permitted to manufacture or commercialize products resulting from our research 
governmental authorities in the us heavily regulate the testing  development  manufacturing  approval and marketing of drugs 
any compound we are testing may not prove to be safe or effective or meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements 
we may elect to  or a regulatory agency may require us to  discontinue development of a compound at any time for scientific  regulatory  commercial or other reasons 
these regulations are complex and change from time to time 
governments in other countries have similar requirements for the testing  development  manufacturing  approval and marketing of drugs  including in the united kingdom the uk  and  as in the us  the requirements are complex and change from time to time 
we are currently conducting a clinical trial on apd in the uk 
in the european union the eu  of which the uk is a member state  a new clinical trials directive a ctd goes into effect on may  under current uk regulations  a filing to the competent regulatory authority is not required to conduct a phase clinical trial in healthy subjects 
however  under the new directive  phase clinical trials in healthy subjects  as well as later clinical trials  will require the filing of a clinical trials authorization a cta to the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency the mhra the equivalent of the fda in the united kingdom 
our current study on apd may not be completed prior to the may  deadline 
any ongoing clinical trials that are active on may   will be subject to the terms of the new directive 
further  this new law also imposes new inspection requirements for clinical trials and for facilities manufacturing clinical trials materials 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years 
to obtain regulatory approval  we must first show that our drug products are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical studies animal testing and clinical trials human testing 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes  and we do not know whether the fda or its foreign counterpart will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any potential drug products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing 
the length of time required varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
interim results of a preclinical study or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
for example  a drug candidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects when tested at the clinical level 
our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  variability in the number and types of patients available for each study  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  unforeseen safety issues or side effects  poor or unanticipated effectiveness of products during the clinical trials  or government or regulatory delays 
data obtained from the clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
in addition  regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of other factors  such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
because  in part  of the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process  we cannot predict whether or not regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we develop 
at the present time  only one of our drug candidates  apd  is undergoing clinical trials 
compounds developed by us  alone or with other parties  may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective 
failure to obtain regulatory approval would delay or prevent us from commercializing products 
our efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees our success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management  development and scientific personnel  and the ability to hire and retain key personnel  particularly in the clinical development area as we transition more of our programs from research into drug development 
we face intense competition for such personnel 
we consider finding and retaining experienced clinical development and other personnel as critical to our future performance 
if we are unable to attract qualified persons or lose the service of key persons  our research and development programs could be interrupted  significantly delayed or otherwise negatively impacted 
our revenues are contingent upon the actions of our existing and potential collaborators our revenues depend on our ability to enter into new collaborative and license agreements and the success of our existing collaborations 
we will receive little revenue under our existing agreements if our own or our collaborators research  development or  ultimately  marketing efforts are unsuccessful  or if our agreements are terminated early 
typically  our collaborators and not us control the development of compounds into drugs after we have met early preclinical scientific milestones  and we are not entitled to the more significant milestones and other payments under our agreements until our collaborators have advanced compounds into clinical testing  which may not occur for many years  if ever 
in and  payments under our collaboration with merck represented approximately and of our revenues  respectively 
absent any new collaborations  we expect substantially all of our revenues in will be derived from our collaboration with merck 
our revenues will be materially impacted if merck terminates its agreement with us  our collaborators do not devote their time and financial resources to develop compounds identified with our technologies  our collaborators dispute whether we have achieved a milestone  rights to a particular receptor or compound  or other terms of our agreements  collaborators and potential collaborators use alternative technologies to our technologies and compete with us in developing drugs  and our collaborators experience failures in the discovery or development of compounds identified with our technologies or in the clinic or marketplace with other drugs that cause them to discontinue or slow down progress under our collaboration 
the term of the collaborative research program with merck is three years from october  merck can terminate this program for any of the following reasons i without cause  at any time on or after october   by giving notice at least days prior to such termination date  if certain milestones have been achieved and paid  ii without cause  at any time after october   by giving days prior notice  iii for certain technical grounds including if the gpcrs are scientifically shown to be unsuitable targets for drug development or valid third party patent rights block the achievement of significant program goals by giving days prior notice  and iv in the event of a change in control of arena  by giving days prior notice 
merck can also terminate the agreement without any reason at any time after october  either party can terminate the agreement at any time for cause if the other party breaches its material obligations under the agreement by causes and reasons within its control  has not cured such breach and there is no dispute as to whether such breach has occurred 
additionally  in lieu of terminating the agreement  merck can terminate certain aspects of the agreement by giving days prior notice if we materially breach our obligations at any time during the period from october   to october  or such earlier date of termination and fail to cure such breach  if such default can be cured but not within a certain period  or if we do not commence and diligently continue good faith efforts to cure such default during such period 
in the event of any such termination  our revenues would be materially adversely affected 
consolidation in our industry and our or our collaborator s inability to obtain acceptable prices for drugs could make partnering more difficult and diminish our revenues consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and setbacks caused by competition from generic drugs and litigation may have an adverse effect on us 
in addition to the number of potential partners being reduced  pharmaceutical companies may be less willing to enter into a new collaboration with us during a time they are integrating a new operation as a result of a merger or acquisition  their therapeutic areas of focus may change following a merger  or they may have reduced research budgets as a result of some financial setback 
in addition  our and our collaborators ability to commercialize future drugs will depend in part on government regulation and the reimbursement policies of government authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
government and third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs 
these efforts may limit our commercial opportunity now by reducing the amount a potential collaborator is willing to pay to license our programs and in the future by reducing the revenues that we and our collaborators could generate from drug sales 
a dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays in our research and development activities our success depends  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
there are many patents and patent applications filed  and that may be filed  by others relating to our drug discovery and development programs that could be determined to be similar  identical or superior to ours or our licensors or collaborators 
our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be determined to infringe these patents 
although the government sponsored project to sequence the human genome has made genomics information freely available to the public  other organizations  companies and individuals are seeking proprietary positions on genomics information that overlap with the government sponsored project 
our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be affected by conflicting positions that may exist between any overlapping genomics information made available publicly as a result of the government sponsored project and genomics information that other organizations  companies or individuals consider to be proprietary 
there could be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
any legal action against us  or our collaborators  claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our drug discovery and development programs could require us  or our collaborators  to obtain a license to continue to use  manufacture or market the affected products  methods or processes  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  prevent us from importing  making  using  selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages  consume a substantial portion of our managerial  scientific and financial resources  or result in litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly  regardless of the outcome 
in addition  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights against third parties 
drug discovery and development is an intensely competitive business that could render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the main focus of our efforts are g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs 
because gpcrs are an important target class for drug discovery efforts  we believe that most pharmaceutical companies  including glaxosmithkline plc  which we view as our chief competitor in terms of gpcr knowledge and expertise  and many biotechnology companies and other organizations  have internal drug discovery programs focused on gpcrs 
another company  organization or individual could have  or could develop  a technology using gpcrs to discover and develop compounds into drugs more effectively or more efficiently than our screening and other technologies 
such a technology could render our technologies  in particular our constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart  and melanophore technology  obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of the drugs that we or our collaborators are attempting to discover and develop would compete with existing therapies 
in addition  many companies are pursuing the development of drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting such as metabolic diseases  cardiovascular diseases  central nervous system disorders and inflammatory diseases 
our competitors  or even our collaborators  may use discovery technologies and techniques to develop compounds into drugs more efficiently or successfully than we or our collaborators are able to do with our technologies 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater research and development capabilities and greater financial  scientific and human resources than we do 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do for the same indication may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights 
in addition  our competitors may develop drugs with fewer side effects  more desirable characteristics such as route of administration or frequency of dosing or greater efficacy than our drugs  if any  for the same indication 
any results from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with our existing or any future collaborators  may not compete successfully with existing products or therapies 
our success is dependent on intellectual property rights held by us and third parties and our interest in these rights is complex and uncertain our success will depend on our own and on our collaborators abilities to obtain  secure and defend patents  and particularly the patents directed to compounds discovered using our technologies 
we have numerous united states and foreign patent applications pending for our technologies  including patent applications on drug lead discovery techniques using cart  genetically altered gpcrs  gpcrs that we have discovered  new uses for previously discovered gpcrs  compounds discovered using cart and melanophore and other technologies 
the procedures for obtaining a patent in the united states and in most foreign countries are complex 
these procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many legal issues 
consequently  we expect that the analysis of our patent applications will be complex and time consuming 
therefore  our patent position is very uncertain and we do not know when  or if  we will obtain additional patents for our technologies 
in  the united states patent and trademark office began issuing broad patent claims that could allow patent holders to control the use of all drug products that modulate a particular drug target or gpcr  regardless of whether the infringing drug product bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing 
the question of whether these new patent claims are valid and if so under what circumstances is highly controversial and the subject of intense litigation 
whether we or our competitors are able to obtain and enforce such patent claims particularly as they apply to the gpcrs that are the subject of our drug development activities may have a large impact on our profits from any drugs that we are able to develop 
moreover  the uncertainty surrounding the validity of these patent claims may make it significantly more difficult to predict future profits and to raise additional financing 
more consistent policies regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents have begun to emerge in the last few years 
for example  on january   the united states patent and trademark office issued finalized utility examination guidelines to its patent examiners that focus on what can be patented under united states patent law 
these guidelines are beginning to be implemented in a more consistent fashion and primarily impact the procedures that are used in determining the types of inventions that can be patented and the minimum threshold of information necessary to patent inventions in the fields of biotechnology and chemistry 
we still do not completely know to what extent these guidelines will ultimately affect our patents or those of our competitors and collaborators 
we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we require all of our employees to contractually agree not to improperly use our trade secrets or disclose them to others  but we may be unable to determine if our employees have conformed or will conform with their legal obligations under these agreements 
we also require collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  but we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of this information 
many of our employees and consultants were  and many of them may currently be  parties to confidentiality agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the use of our technologies could violate these agreements 
in addition  third parties may independently discover our trade secrets or proprietary information 
technology licensed to us by others  or in licensed technology  is important to some aspects of our business 
with a few exceptions  we generally do not control the patent prosecution  maintenance or enforcement of in licensed technology 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over in licensed technology as we do over our internally developed technologies 
moreover  some of our academic institution licensors  research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired 
we cannot protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world filing patents on all of our drug discovery technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive 
competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own drug products 
these products may compete with our products and may not be covered by any of our patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
patent law outside the united states is also uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revision  particularly with respect to biotechnology related and pharmaceutical inventions 
the laws of some countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states laws 
it may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our  or our competitors  foreign patents  which could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
we may encounter significant delays or problems with our new chemical development facility we have a chemical development facility that we are using for process research  the scale up and production of intermediates and other compounds for research and development purposes  and the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients 
we are completing the activities needed to obtain the applicable manufacturing licenses to produce materials in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
us  europe and other regulatory authorities require that clinical and commercial products be manufactured according to cgmp regulations 
in addition  drug manufacturing facilities in the state of california must be inspected and licensed by the california department of health services in compliance with state regulatory requirements 
california law prohibits the shipment of product from a manufacturing facility for any clinical testing or commercial use prior to satisfaction of licensing requirements 
there is no assurance that we will obtain a license  or obtain it in a timely manner 
we may encounter delays and problems in operating our chemical development facility due to governmental approvals  permits and regulation of the facility  accidents during operation of the facility  installation of equipment for the facility  delays in receiving raw materials from suppliers  natural or other disasters  or other factors inherent in operating a complex manufacturing facility 
even if we are able to successfully commence full operation of our chemical development facility  we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs 
in addition  our future manufacturing needs may not be sufficient to allow the facility to be fully operational 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may cause our stock price to decline our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  depending on a variety of factors  including our success or failure in clinical trials  the timing of the discovery of drug leads and the development of drug candidates  if any  entering into a new collaboration or modifying or terminating an existing collaboration  the timing and receipt by us of milestone and royalty payments  if any  changes in the research and development budgets of our existing collaborators or potential collaborators  others introducing new drug discovery techniques or new drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we or our collaborators target  regulatory actions  changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights or other matters 
we are not able to control all of these factors 
period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
if our revenues in a particular period do not meet stockholders or analysts expectations  our stock price may decline and such decline could be significant 
there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market 
the sale of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
any future equity issuances by us may have dilutive and other effects on our existing stockholders 
there were  shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  the outstanding shares of our series b convertible preferred stock were initially convertible into up to  shares of common stock at per share of common stock 
holders of the series b convertible preferred stock will receive a annual dividend that is payable by issuing common stock or by increasing the amount of common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock 
in addition  our series b convertible preferred stock owners hold warrants to acquire common stock and unit warrants to acquire series b convertible preferred stock and additional warrants to acquire common stock  which  if exercised and converted  would obligate us to issue up to  additional shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  as of january   there were  common stock options issued and outstanding under our equity compensation plans at a weighted average exercise price of   additional shares of common stock issuable under our equity compensation plans   shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan and  shares issuable under a deferred compensation plan 
a substantial number of the shares described above  when issued upon exercise  will be available for immediate resale in the public market 
the market price of our common stock could fall as a result of such resales due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
we have financed our operations  and we expect to continue to finance our operations  primarily by issuing and selling our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining 
provisions of our preferred stock may prevent or make it more difficult for us to raise funds or take certain other actions 
in december  we completed the private placement to two institutional investors of i an aggregate of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock  ii seven year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and iii unit warrants to purchase for a period of approximately months up to  of our series b convertible preferred stock and additional seven year warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share
