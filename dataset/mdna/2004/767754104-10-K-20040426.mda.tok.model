item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income for fiscal was million  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal and million in fiscal reasons for the substantial improvement in our results in fiscal are described in more detail in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this item however  some of the key factors that impacted this improvement are summarized as follows productivity of existing store base 
our strategy is to focus on improving the productivity of our existing store base 
we have focused our efforts on improving the productivity of our stores by implementing programs to drive pharmacy sales growth  improving our product categories to offer more personalized products and service to our customers  increasing our mix of private brand and generic drug sales  developing programs that are specifically directed toward improving our pharmacy service and implementing associate programs that create compensatory and other incentives for associates to provide customers with better service 
we believe that our improvements in revenues  gross margin as a percentage of revenues and selling  general and administrative costs sg a as a percent of revenues that are detailed in the results of operations section are a direct result of our success in implementing this strategy of improving the productivity of our stores  evidenced by a rise in average revenue per store from million in fiscal to million in fiscal debt refinancing 
in fiscal and again in fiscal  we took several steps to improve our leverage and extend the terms of a substantial amount of our debt 
in fiscal  we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new credit facility  issued new senior notes  and repurchased portions of several existing notes prior to maturity 
these activities resulted in a loss of million related to the termination of the old senior secured credit facility and the issuance of the new senior secured credit facility  offset by net gains of million related to the note repurchases described above 
our fiscal refinancing  extended the maturity of the majority of our debt  converted a portion of our debt to equity and rescinded purchase options on certain sale leaseback leases  resulting in their reclassification from capital leases to operating leases 
these activities resulted in aggregate charges of million in fiscal these steps have enabled us to reduce our debt from billion as of february  to billion as of february   and to extend the maturity of the majority of our debt to and beyond 
these transactions are discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
closure of under performing stores 
we performed a rigorous review of underperforming stores  and  based on these reviews  decided to close  and stores in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of these closures and our annual review of our stores operating performance for potential impairment  we have recorded store closing and related impairment charges of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that these closures were necessary to improve the productivity of our remaining store base and to eliminate underperforming stores 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we will continue to assess stores for potential closure 
there can be no assurance that other such actions may not be required in the future  or that such actions would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period in which we take those actions 
substantial investigation expenses 
we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with defense against litigation related to prior management s business practices and the defense of prior management 
we incurred million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect to incur approximately million in fiscal  and expect to continue to incur significant legal and other expenses until the resolution of the us attorney s case against certain of our former executive officers and the investigation of certain other matters 
stock based compensation expense 
we recorded stock based compensation expense benefit of million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the expense recorded in fiscal resulted primarily from the application of the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation expense  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal the expense benefit recorded in fiscal and resulted primarily from the impact of applying variable plan accounting to several of our stock based compensation plans and the vesting of restricted stock grants 
dilutive equity issuances 
at february   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible notes and preferred stock 
our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consist of the following shares in thousands

a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million b the conversion of these notes to equity would reduce the principal amount of debt by million working capital 
we generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we expect to use cash from operations and  when necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance inventories and to support our continued growth 
the majority of our front end sales are in cash 
third party payors  which typically settle in fewer than days  accounted for of our pharmacy sales and of our revenues in fiscal industry trends we believe pharmacy sales in the united states will increase at least over the next three years based on studies provided by pharmacy benefit management companies and the congressional budget office 
this rate of increase is lower than it has been in the past five years 
the anticipated increase of over the next three years is expected to be driven by the baby boom generation entering their fifties  the increasing life expectancy of the american population  the introduction of several new drugs  the rate of inflation and expanded consumer access to drug benefits under the recent medicare program modifications 
the retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and has been experiencing consolidation 
we believe that continued consolidation of the drugstore industry  continued new store openings  increased mandatory mail order and drug importation will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
in addition  sales of potential generic pharmaceuticals continue to grow as a percentage of total prescription drug sales  which has a dampening effect on sales growth 
the growth rate of prescription drug sales has also been impacted by slower introductions of successful new prescription drugs 
the retail drugstore industry relies significantly on third party payors at an increasing rate 
third party payors  especially state sponsored medicaid agencies  have recently evaluated and reduced certain reimbursement levels 
also  modifications to the medicare program are being implemented that will provide discount cards to senior citizens in the near term and will expand coverage of prescription drugs 
if third party payors  including state sponsored medicaid agencies  reduce their reimbursement levels  or if medicare covers prescription drugs at lower reimbursement levels  sales and margins in the industry could be reduced  and the profitability of the industry could be adversely effected

revenues the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by pharmacy sales growth of  and front end sales growth of 
sales growth in both pharmacy and front end was driven by same store sales  which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below 
we include in same store sales all stores that have been open in each comparable fiscal year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocated stores are not considered new stores in our calculation 
fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by  due primarily to increases in price per prescriptions and  to a lesser extent  increases in the number of prescriptions filled 
the increase in price per prescription was driven by inflation  partially offset by an increase in generic sales mix 
the increase in the number of prescriptions filled was aided by prescription file purchases  a more severe flu season  and favorable industry trends 
favorable industry trends include an aging population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems  and the introduction of a number of successful prescription drugs 
partially offsetting increases in the number of prescriptions filled was an increase in third party payors requiring customers to use mail order for certain prescriptions and a reduction in hormone replacement therapy and non sedating antihistamine prescriptions 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of improvement in most core categories  such as over the counter items  consumables and vitamins and improved assortments 
also contributing to front end same store sales increases was the switch of certain prescriptions to over the counter products 
pharmacy and front end same store sales increases in fiscal benefited from increased business in our southern california stores  driven by the migration of customers impacted by a union strike at several grocery store chains 
the union strike ended the beginning of march early indications are we will be successful in retaining a significant amount of these customers in both the pharmacy and front end parts of our business 
the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by pharmacy sales growth of  offset slightly by a front end sales decline of 
the decline in front end sales was a direct result of closing stores in fiscal  partially offset by same store sales growth of 
fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by  due to increases in both the number of prescriptions filled and sales price per prescription 
factors contributing to our pharmacy same store sales increases include inflation  improved attraction and retention of managed care customers  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives  such as predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
these favorable factors were partially offset by the increase in generic sales mix  a reduction in hormone replacement therapy prescriptions and the impact of a less severe flu season than in the prior year 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of improvement in most core categories  such as over the counter items  consumables and vitamins  and improved assortments 
fiscal weeks revenues increased over fiscal weeks 
excluding the extra week  revenues would have increased  driven by increases of in front end and in pharmacy 
same store sales growth for fiscal was pharmacy of and front end of 
as fiscal was a week year  same store sales are calculated by comparing the week period ended march  with the week period ended march fiscal pharmacy sales led sales growth due to an increase in both the number of prescriptions filled on a comparable week basis and sales price per prescription 
factors contributing to our pharmacy same store sales increases include inflation  improved attraction and retention of managed care customers  our reduced cash pricing  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives  such as predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
front end fiscal sales also increased 
the increase was primarily a result of increased sales volume due to improved assortments  lower prices on key items and distributing a nationwide weekly advertising circular

cost of goods sold gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin was positively impacted by improvements in both pharmacy and front end margin 
improvement in pharmacy margin was driven by improved generic product mix and reduced inventory costs resulting from purchasing improvements  partially offset by lower reimbursement rates

overall gross margin was negatively impacted by an increase in pharmacy sales mix

the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenues  compared to for fiscal sg a expenses for fiscal include million incurred primarily to defend against litigation related to prior management s business practices and to defend prior management

impairment charges in fiscal  and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets including allocable goodwill for fiscal at  and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were assessed for impairment as part of our on going review of the performance of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close the store 
store and equipment lease exit credits charges in fiscal  and  we recorded charges for  and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
effective january   charges to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  were recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities 
prior to january   charges incurred to close a store were recorded at the time management committed to closing the store 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
the effect of adjustments to the risk free rate of interest and the reversal of reserves established for stores that were previously committed for closure by management  but ultimately were not closed  resulted in a net credit for fiscal interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a decrease in debt issue cost amortization and the reclassification of closed store interest expense  which  pursuant to sfas no 
 is classified as a component of store closing and impairment charges 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the reduction of debt resulting from the retirement and repurchase of certain notes  and a reduction in libor rates  which reduced our interest rate on the senior secured credit facility 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were   and respectively 
interest rate swap contracts we entered into two year interest rate swap contracts in june and july of to hedge the exposure to increasing rates with respect to our variable rate debt 
as a result of the june refinancing  the interest rate swap contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment  and therefore the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts were required to be recorded as components of net loss 
accordingly  we recognized an initial charge of million and subsequent changes in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million  inclusive of cash payments  which resulted in a charge of million for fiscal changes in market value of the interest rate swaps in fiscal were not significant 
these contracts expired and were fully funded during fiscal and have not been renewed 
income taxes tax benefits of million  million and million have been recorded for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal benefit is comprised of a federal tax benefit of million offset by a state tax expense of million 
the federal benefit is related to the conclusion of the internal revenue service examination for fiscal years through  representing recoverable federal and state income taxes and interest  as well as a reduction of previously recorded liabilities 
the state tax expense of million is the result of the provision from operations for state income taxes for which the use of net operating losses were temporarily suspended by certain jurisdictions 
the fiscal benefit resulted primarily from the federal tax law change  enacted on march   which increased the carryback period of net operating losses incurred in fiscal and from two years to five 
the fiscal benefit is primarily due to the favorable outcome of federal income tax litigation 
the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards nols and net deferred tax assets generated in each period have been fully offset by a valuation allowance as a result of management s determination that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if and when our operations in some jurisdictions were to become sufficiently profitable to recover previously reserved deferred tax assets  we would reduce all or a portion of the applicable valuation allowance in the period that such determination is made 
this would result in an increase to reported earnings in such period 
we have undergone an ownership change for statutory tax purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that this limitation does not further impair the net operating loss carryforwards because they are fully reserved 
during fiscal  we received federal income tax refunds in the amount of million based on the favorable outcome of federal income tax litigation and tax law changes permitting the five year carryback of nols 
liquidity and capital resources general we have three primary sources of liquidity i cash equivalent investments  ii cash provided by operations and iii the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to provide funds for capital expenditures  including prescription file purchases  and to provide funds for repurchases of our publicly traded debt 
our ability to borrow under the senior secured credit facility is based on a specified borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and prescription files 
on february   we had million in additional available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
transactions on may   we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility 
the new facility consists of a billion term loan and a million revolving credit facility which will mature on april  the proceeds of the loans made on the closing of the new credit facility were  among other things  used to repay the outstanding amounts under the old facility and to purchase the land and buildings at our perryman  md and lancaster  ca distribution centers  which had previously been leased through a synthetic lease arrangement 
on august   we amended and restated the senior secured credit facility  which reduced the interest rate on term loan borrowings under the senior secured credit facility by basis points 
substantially all of rite aid corporation s wholly owned subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the new senior secured credit facility 
the subsidiary guarantees are secured by a first priority lien on  among other things  the inventory  accounts receivable and prescription files of the subsidiary guarantors 
rite aid corporation is a holding company with no direct operations and is dependent upon dividends  distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to service payments under the new senior secured credit facility 
rite aid corporation s direct obligations under the new senior secured credit facility are unsecured 
the new senior secured credit facility allows for the issuance of up to million in additional term loans or additional revolver availability 
we may request the additional loans at any time prior to the maturity of the senior secured credit facility  provided we are not in default of any terms of the facility  nor are in violation of any financial covenants 
the new senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured debt in addition to the senior secured credit facility 
accordingly  at february   the remaining additional permitted secured debt under the new senior credit facility is million 
we have the ability to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt  if the terms of such unsecured indebtedness comply with certain terms set forth in the credit agreement and subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants 
if we issue unsecured debt that does not meet the credit agreement restrictions  it reduces the amount of available permitted secured debt 
the new senior secured credit facility also allows for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity prior to april   and for a limited amount of debt with a maturity after april   based upon outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and available cash at the time of the repurchase 
the new senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants  which place restrictions on incurrence of debt  the payment of dividends  mergers  liens and sale and leaseback transactions 
the new senior secured credit facility also requires us to meet various financial ratios and limits capital expenditures 
for the twelve months ending february   the covenants require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of subsequent to february   the ratio gradually decreases to for the twelve months ending march  we must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of for the twelve months ending february  subsequent to february   the ratio gradually increases to for the twelve months ending march  in addition  we must maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio of for the twelve months ending february  subsequent to february   the ratio gradually increases to for the twelve months ending march  capital expenditures are limited to million for the fiscal year ending february   with the allowable amount increasing in subsequent years 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the new senior secured credit facility and our other debt instruments as of february  with continuing improvements in operating performance  we anticipate that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
however  variations in our operating performance and unanticipated developments may adversely affect our ability to remain in compliance with the applicable debt covenants 
the new senior secured credit facility provides for customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of our debt to accelerate the maturity of debt having a principal amount in excess of million 
on october   we paid  at maturity  our remaining outstanding balance of million on the dealer remarketable securities 
in may  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due these notes are unsecured and effectively subordinate to our secured debt 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains customary covenant provisions that  amount other things  include limitations on our ability to pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  incur debt  grant liens  sell assets and enter into sale lease back transactions 
in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations to rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured  unsubordinated indebtedness 
our obligations under the notes are guaranteed  subject to certain limitations  by subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under our new senior secured credit facility 
the guarantees are secured  subject to the permitted liens  by shared second priority liens  with the holders of our senior notes and our senior secured notes  granted by subsidiary guarantors on all of their assets that secure the obligations under the new senior secured credit facility  subject to certain exceptions 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes contains customary covenant provisions that  among other things  include limitations on our ability to pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  incur debt  grant liens  sell assets and enter into sales lease back transactions 
during fiscal we repurchased the following securities in thousands

refinancing and other transactions on june   we completed a major refinancing that extended the maturity dates of the majority of our debt to or beyond  provided additional equity  converted a portion of our debt to equity and reclassified capital leases to operating leases 
the components of the refinancing are described in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
major components of the refinancing are summarized below senior secured credit facility we entered into a new billion syndicated senior secured credit facility 
the new facility matured on june  unless more than million of our senior notes due april  were outstanding on december   in which event the maturity date was march  the new facility consisted of a billion term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the term loan was used to prepay various outstanding debt balances 
this facility was repaid and replaced with our new senior secured credit facility on may   as described above 
high yield notes we issued million of senior notes due july these notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinate to our secured debt 
debt for debt exchange we exchanged million of our existing senior secured notes for an equal principal amount of senior secured notes due september  the notes are secured by a second priority lien on the collateral of the senior secured credit facility 
in addition  holders of these notes received warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at per share 
on june   the warrant holders elected to exercise these warrants  on a cashless basis and as a result million shares of common stock were issued 
tender offer on may   we commenced a tender offer for the senior secured notes due at a price of of the principal amount 
the tender offer was closed on june   at which time million principal was tendered 
we incurred a tender offer premium of million as a result of the transaction 
we used proceeds from the new senior secured credit facility to pay for the tender offer 
debt repurchases we repurchased million of our dealer remarketable securities due  million of our notes due and million of our convertible subordinated notes due during fiscal debt for equity exchanges we completed exchanges of million of debt for million shares of common stock 
sales of common stock we issued million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
lease obligations we relinquished certain renewal options which had been available under the terms of certain real estate leases on property previously sold and leased back and accordingly  we reclassified the related leases as operating leases thereby reducing outstanding capital lease obligations by million 
impact on results of operations for fiscal as a result of the fiscal refinancing  we i recognized a loss of million related to the early retirement of debt  ii recognized a loss of million related to debt and lease conversions and modifications and iii recognized a charge of million related to debt for equity exchanges 
other transactions on december   we entered into a contract with mckesson  the supplier of our pharmaceutical products 
the terms of the contract require that mckesson serve as our supplier through march in exchange for better pricing  we agreed to reduce the payment terms under the mckesson contract by five calendar days 
this change in payment terms will not have a significant impact on our liquidity or working capital 
other as of february   the company had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table details the maturities of our indebtedness and lease financing obligations as of february   as well as other contractual cash obligations and commitments

net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  which more than offset million in interest payments and increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  income tax refunds of million and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  which more than offset million in interest payments and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  a significant reduction in interest payments and a reduction in inventory levels net of a decrease in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash of million was used to purchase land and buildings at our perryman  md and lancaster  ca distribution centers  which had previously been held under a synthetic lease arrangement 
cash of million was used for the purchase of other fixed assets and cash of million was used for the purchase of prescription files 
cash of million was provided by the disposition of fixed assets and other investments 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash of million was used for the purchase of fixed assets and cash of million was used for the purchase of prescription files 
cash of million was provided by the disposition of fixed assets and other investments 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal cash was provided from the sale of our investment in advancepcs  less expenditures for fixed assets and prescription file purchases 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal cash usage related to the change in our credit facility  the early redemption of several bonds and payments on certain bonds at maturity was largely offset by proceeds from bond issuances 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal the cash used consisted of the repayments of long term debt and deferred financing fees  offset with proceeds from the issuance of bonds 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the cash used consisted of repayments of long term debt of billion and payments of deferred financing costs of million  offset with new borrowing of billion  bond proceeds of million and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million to million during fiscal  consisting of approximately to million related to new store construction  store relocation and store remodel projects  to million related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers  and other corporate requirements  and to million related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility available under our senior secured facility 
we have resumed the activities of a new store and store relocation program 
initially  the program will start out slowly and will not have a significant impact on operating results or the profile of our store base 
in fiscal  our goal is to open or relocate between and stores by the end of fiscal and an additional stores by the end of fiscal approximately of the stores will be relocated stores and the remaining will be new stores 
the program is focused on our strongest existing markets 
it also includes a significant number of remodels 
we believe that this program over the longer term  along with the execution of the near term strategy of improving store productivity  will continue to increase our sales and operating profits 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon current levels of operations and planned improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations together with cash equivalent investments and available borrowings under the senior credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated annual requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
obtaining any such supplemental liquidity through the increase of indebtedness or asset sales may require the consent of the lenders under one or more of our debt agreements 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or that our lenders would provide the necessary consents  if required 
recent accounting pronouncements we have several stock option plans 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
effective march  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the modified prospective method of adoption selected by us under the provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  compensation cost recognized in fiscal is the same as that which would have been recognized had the recognition provisions of sfas no 
been applied from its original effective date 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fsab issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company s statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective  except for certain provisions that have been deferred  for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have adopted the classification and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 our redeemable preferred stock balance of million is included in other non current liabilities as of february  we have not adopted the measurement provisions of sfas no 
as those provisions have been deferred indefinitely 
the measurement provisions  if and when they are required to be adopted  are not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january of  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires the consolidation of entities that cannot finance their activities without the support of other parties and that lack certain characteristics of a controlling interest  such as the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities via voting or similar rights 
an entity that consolidates a variable interest entity is the primary beneficiary of the entity s activities 
fin applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and required application in the first period ending after december  for entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest entity that it acquired before february  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december of  the fasb revised fin fin r  which delayed the required implementation date for variable interest entities until the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  fin r applies to our financial statements for the period ending may  we do not believe the adoption of fin r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgements and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventory included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrink  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates that our reserves are based on  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including stores and excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to these facilities 
goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test as of february   resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgements and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance liabilities we record estimates for self insured medical  dental  worker s compensation and general liability insurance coverage with assistance from actuaries 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are based on market interest rates  and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the accumulated benefit obligation of the defined benefit plans is a discounted amount calculated using the market interest rates described above 
market interest rates at the end of fiscal are at historically low levels 
accordingly  we believe the market interest rates will not significantly decrease further 
an increase in the market interest rates  assuming no other changes in the estimates  reduces the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation and the related required expense 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  anticipated future subleases of properties and current risk free interest rates 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
factors affecting our future prospects risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
we had  as of february   billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders equity of million 
we also had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million at that time  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
our debt obligations adversely affect our operations in a number of ways and while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal year  there can be no assurance that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt  which may require us to borrow additional funds for that purpose  restructure or otherwise refinance our debt 
our earnings were insufficient to cover our fixed charges for fiscal by million 
our high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will

limit our ability to obtain additional financing  
spacer 
gif 

spacer

limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to substantially improve our operating performance  which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
if our cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient  we may take certain actions  including delaying or reducing capital or other expenditures  attempting to restructure or refinance our debt  selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital 
we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
further  any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business 
our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions 
our failure to earn enough to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us 
some of our debt  including borrowings under our senior credit facility  is based upon variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
approximately billion of our outstanding indebtedness as of february  bears an interest rate that varies depending upon libor 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior credit facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on this outstanding debt will also increase 
therefore an increase in libor would increase our interest payment obligations under these outstanding loans and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
we currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest 
the covenants in our outstanding indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to

grant negative pledges to other creditors 
if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants  a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we obtain modifications of our agreements  or are required to obtain waivers of defaults  we may incur significant fees and transaction costs 
in fiscal   and  we modified certain covenants contained in our then existing senior credit facility and loan agreements 
in fiscal  we obtained waivers of compliance contained in our then existing credit facilities and public indentures 
in connection with obtaining these modifications and waivers  we paid significant fees and transaction costs 
our new store development program requires entering into construction and development commitments and occasionally purchasing land that will not be utilized for several years which may limit our financial flexibility 
construction and development commitments are entered into as part of our new store development program that must be completed 
also  capital expenditures are occasionally made for land that may not be used for several years 
if there are significant negative economic or competitive developments  these commitments must still be met 
further  the net book value of the purchased land may not be realizable 
risks related to our operations we need to continue to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition  but our operations will not improve if we cannot continue to effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by general economic conditions 
although we have had significant improvement in the sales productivity of our store base  we have not yet achieved the sales productivity level of our major competitors 
we believe that improving the sales of existing stores is important to achieving profitability and continuing to improve operating cash flow 
if we are not successful in implementing our strategy  or if our strategy is not effective  we may not be able to continue to improve our operations 
in addition  any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products  and cause a proportionately greater decrease in our profitability 
failure to continue to improve operations or a decline in general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our executive management team 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial condition or cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal investigations by the united states attorney 
in addition to any fines or damages that we might have to pay  any criminal conviction against us may result in the loss of licenses and contracts that are material to the conduct of our business  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal governmental investigations by the united states attorney involving matters related to prior management s business practices 
settlement discussions have begun with the united states attorney of the middle district of pennsylvania  who has proposed that the government would not institute any criminal proceeding against us if we enter into a consent judgment providing for a civil penalty payable over a period of years 
the amount of the civil penalty has not been agreed to and there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached or that the amount of such penalty will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we recorded an accrual of million in fiscal in connection with the resolution of these matters  however  we may incur charges in excess of that amount and we are unable to estimate the possible range of loss 
we will continue to evaluate our estimate and to the extent that additional information arises or our strategy changes  we will adjust our accrual accordingly 
if we were convicted of any crime  certain licenses and government contracts  such as medicaid plan reimbursement agreements  that are material to our operations may be revoked  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  substantial penalties  damages or other monetary remedies assessed against us could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in this relationship may have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we obtain approximately of the dollar value of our prescription drugs from a single supplier  mckesson  pursuant to a contract that runs through march pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and  therefore  our relationship with mckesson is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationship with mckesson may temporarily make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business  until we found a replacement supplier  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   the general instability in the middle east and the threat of other attacks or acts of war in the united states and abroad may adversely affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
the attacks of september  and subsequent events  have caused instability in the united states and other financial markets and have led  and may continue to lead to  further armed hostilities  prolonged military action in iraq  or further acts of terrorism in the united states or abroad  which could cause further instability in financial markets and reduced consumer confidence 
the threat of terrorist attacks  and other related developments may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions  resulting in reduced consumer spending and reduced sales in our stores 
these developments will subject us to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  discount stores  dollar stores  mail order pharmacies and drug importation 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
the ability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of customers 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue effectively to compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales of prescription drugs  as a percentage of sales  and the percentage of prescription sales reimbursed by third parties  have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase 
in fiscal  sales of prescription drugs represented of our sales and of all of the prescription drugs that we sold were with third party payors 
during fiscal  the top five third party payors accounted for approximately of our total sales 
any significant loss of third party payor business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
also  these third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  the passing in december of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act will grant a prescription drug benefit to participants 
as a result of this benefit  we may be reimbursed for some prescription drugs at prices lower than our current reimbursement levels 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from state sponsored medicaid agencies 
there have been a number of recent proposals and enactments by various states to reduce medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget problems  some of which propose to reduce reimbursement levels in the applicable states significantly  and we expect other similar proposals in the future 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare or state medicaid programs cover prescription drugs at lower reimbursement levels  our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business and our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our pharmacy business is subject to federal  state and local regulation 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
furthermore  our pharmacies could be affected by federal and state reform programs  such as healthcare reform initiatives which could  in turn  negatively affect our business 
the passing of these initiatives or any new federal or state programs could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our pharmacy business is subject to the patient privacy and other obligations including corporate  pharmacy and associate responsibility  imposed by the health insurance portability and accountability act 
as a covered entity  we are required to implement privacy standards  train our associates on the permitted use and disclosures of protected health information  provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy health customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information 
failure to properly adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  from time to time  claims result in the payment of significant amounts  some portions of which are not funded by insurance 
we can offer no assurance that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
there is a nationwide shortage of qualified pharmacists 
in response  we have implemented improved competitive benefits and training programs in order to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
we have also expanded our pharmacist recruiting efforts  through an increase in the number of recruiters  a succesful pharmacist intern program and improved relations with pharmacy schools 
however  we may not be able to attract  hire and retain enough qualified pharmacists 
this could adversely affect our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february

our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the ratings on the new senior secured credit facility as of april  were bb by standard poor s and ba by moody s 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings on this facility are libor plus for the term loan and for the revolving credit facility 
downgrades of our credit ratings could have an impact upon the rate on the borrowings under these credit facilities 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of february  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately  million on february  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
