item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the holding company business nature of holding company operations dhc is a holding company whose principal operations consist of subsidiaries in the insurance industry in the western united states  primarily california 
dhc also has equity interests in companies engaged in the marine transportation and services industry 
dhc holds all of the voting stock of danielson indemnity company dind 
dind owns percent of the common stock of naicc  dhc s principal operating insurance subsidiary  which owns percent of the common stock of valor insurance company  incorporated a montana domiciled specialty insurance company valor  danielson insurance company and danielson national insurance company dind  national american insurance company of california and its subsidiaries being collectively referred to hereinafter as naicc 
tax loss carryforward at the close of  dhc had consolidated nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
this estimate was based upon federal consolidated income tax losses for the periods through december  and an estimate of the taxable results 
some or all of the carryforward may be available to offset  for federal income tax purposes  the future taxable income  if any  of dhc  its wholly owned subsidiaries and the mission trusts described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of dhc s tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nol carryforward were reported 
the nols are currently fully reserved  for valuation purposes  on dhc s consolidated financial statements 
dhc s nols will expire  if not used  in the following approximate amounts in the following years dollars in thousands amount of carryforward year expiring dhc s ability to utilize its nols would be substantially reduced if dhc were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
dhc will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a increase in stock ownership during a three year testing period by stockholders 
in an effort to reduce the risk of an ownership change  dhc has imposed restrictions on the ability of holders of five percent or more of the common stock  as well as the ability of others to become five percent stockholders as a result of transfers of common stock 
the transfer restrictions were implemented in  and dhc expects that they will remain in force as long as the nols are available to dhc 
notwithstanding such transfer restrictions  there could be circumstances under which an issuance by dhc of a significant number of new shares of common stock or other new class of equity security having certain characteristics for example  the right to vote or convert into common stock might result in an ownership change under the internal revenue code 
the insurance services business nature of insurance operations naicc manages its business across four principal lines of business  private passenger automobile  commercial automobile  workers compensation  and property and casualty 
as of december   naicc was engaged in writing exclusively non standard private passenger automobile primarily in california 
insurers admitted in california are required to obtain approval from the california department of insurance of rates and or forms prior to being used 
many of the other states  in which naicc does business  have similar requirements 
rates and policy forms are developed by naicc and filed with the regulators in each of the relevant states  depending upon each state s requirements 
naicc relies upon its own as well as industry experience in establishing rates 
private passenger automobile naicc began writing non standard private passenger automobile insurance in california in july  in idaho  oregon and washington in april  and in arizona and nevada in policyholder selection is governed by underwriting guidelines established by naicc 
non standard risks are those segments of the driving public which generally are not considered preferred business  such as drivers with a record of prior accidents or driving violations  drivers involved in particular occupations or driving certain types of vehicles  or those who have been non renewed or declined by another insurance company 
generally  non standard premium rates are higher than standard premium rates and policy limits are lower than typical policy limits 
management believes that it is able to achieve underwriting success through refinement of various risk profiles  thereby dividing the non standard market into more defined segments which can be adequately priced 
additionally  traditional lower limits lend themselves to quicker claims processing allowing management to respond more quickly to changing loss trends and revise underlying underwriting and rate filings 
net written premiums were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  for the non standard private passenger automobile program 
net written premiums for non standard private passenger automobile in california were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in private passenger automobile premiums in is the result of underwriting restrictions placed on the california non standard automobile program in february private passenger automobile policy limits vary by state 
in california and arizona  non standard policies primarily provide maximum coverage up to  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
in oregon  and washington  non standard policies provide minimum coverage of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage  and can provide coverage to a maximum of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
in general  preferred policies provide coverage to a maximum of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
in  naicc ceded percent of its california non standard private passenger automobile business to a major reinsurance company under a quota share reinsurance agreement 
effective january   the treaty was not renewed 
naicc s oregon and washington non standard automobile  california preferred automobile business  and its commercial automobile business is reinsured on an excess of loss basis  where the company retains the first  of insured losses 
although the non california business was placed in run off in the non standard california business had increased due to the fact that approximately half the carriers exited the state in providing naicc greater market share but at the expense of underwriting results 
as policies have been renewed they have been renewed at significantly higher rates 
naicc does not write any business through managing general agents 
its california non standard private passenger automobile  representing of net written premiums  was produced through one general agent as compared to in for the same general agent 
in  naicc commenced writing preferred risks in california through a different general agent and has since placed that segment in run off 
arizona  idaho  oregon  and washington business was written directly through appointed independent agents 
commercial automobile naicc began writing non standard commercial automobile insurance in through independent agents 
the majority of automobiles owned or used by businesses are insured under policies that provide other coverage for the business  such as commercial multi peril insurance 
businesses which are unable to insure a specific driver and businesses having vehicles not qualifying for commercial multi peril insurance are typical naicc commercial automobile policyholders 
examples of these risks include drivers with more than one moving violation  one and two vehicle accounts  and specialty haulers  such as sand and gravel  farm vehicles and certain short haul common carriers 
the typical naicc commercial automobile policy covers fleets of four or fewer vehicles 
naicc does not insure interstate trucking  trucks hauling logs  gasoline or similar higher hazard operations 
the current average annual premium of the policies in force is approximately  net written premiums for commercial automobile insurance were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in commercial automobile premiums in was attributable to naicc s decision to exit this line of business 
the decision to exit the market was primarily driven by the unprofitable historical underwriting results and relatively high net retentions for this line of business 
no new commercial automobile policies were issued after july and no policies were renewed after september the decrease in commercial automobile premiums during was attributable to management s decision in september to curtail marketing efforts in this line of business 
the maximum non standard commercial automobile policy limit provided by naicc is million for bodily injury and property damage combined as a single limit of liability for each occurrence 
naicc retains the first  of bodily injury and property damage combined as a single limit of liability for each occurrence 
workers compensation naicc began writing workers compensation insurance in through january  naicc and its subsidiary valor wrote workers compensation insurance primarily in california and montana 
naicc previously wrote workers compensation insurance in california and four other western states 
workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage for statutory benefits which employers are required to pay to employees who are injured in the course of employment including  among other things  temporary or permanent disability benefits  death benefits  medical and hospital expenses and expenses for vocational rehabilitation 
policies were issued having a term of no more than one year 
in response to market developments affecting california workers compensation  including worsening loss experience  naicc decided to exit the workers compensation line of business 
the last california workers compensation policy was issued in july and the last policy issued outside of california was issued in january net written premiums for workers compensation were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in and reflects the decision to exit the workers compensation line as discussed above 
net written premiums for valor workers compensation were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
valor began non renewing all policies in december and was placed into run off effective january naicc retains the first  of each workers compensation loss and has purchased reinsurance for up to million in excess of its retention  the first million of which has been placed with three major reinsurance companies with the remaining million provided by other companies 
in april  naicc entered into a workers compensation excess of loss reinsurance agreement with scor re insurance company that provided coverage commencing at losses of  in may  naicc entered into a workers compensation excess of loss reinsurance agreement with pma re insurance company that provided coverage commencing at losses of  property and casualty as of december   naicc through a series of assumption agreements assumed the assets and liabilities of the stuyvesant insurance company stuyvesant for policies issued prior to  along with then other affiliated hf ahmanson insurance subsidiaries collectively referred as hf ahmanson 
naicc was subsequently acquired by kcp holding company kcp on september  on july   mission american insurance company maic pursuant to an assumption agreement transferred all of its assets and liabilities accident years through to naicc in exchange for of kcp s total common stock 
maic was part of the mission insurance group  inc  which subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on august  as dhc 
on december   dhc acquired the remaining outstanding shares of kcp not then indirectly owned by dhc by maic 
naicc for the years to wrote a commercial multi peril program for artisan contractors  and separately  a homeowners program from to by the same general agent that wrote the companies california preferred automobile program 
naicc continues to discharge claims arising under its own insurance policies and contracts and those issued by maic  stuyvesant and other hf ahmanson former insurance subsidiaries 
the property and casualty claims are categorized into the following direct excess and primary policies  workers compensation  reinsurance assumed on an excess of loss basis  and reinsurance assumed on pool business primarily from the london marketplace 
nearly all remaining claims on policies  issued by companies other than by naicc  are of an asbestos and environmental a e nature 
as of december   there remained direct excess and primary claims  of which were related to policies issued by stuyvesant  by hf ahmanson entities  by maic and by naicc 
these claims generally have policy limits up to  with reinsurance generally above  the naicc issued policies are approaching the year statute of limitations baring future claims accepted 
as of december   there were open workers compensation claims  the majority of which were issued by maic with no reinsurance coverage 
the assumed reinsurance contracts have relatively low participation  generally less than  and estimates of unpaid losses have been based on information provided by the primary insurance companies 
at december   there were open claims related to excess of loss assumed reinsurance 
as of december  and  naicc s net unpaid losses and loss of adjustment expenses relating to a e claims were approximately million and million  respectively 
in the most current three years of development there has been an influx of newly reported a e cases on an excess of loss basis related to the stuyvesant issued policies that are beginning to pierce the limits in which naicc participates 
new cases reported in  and on the assumed excess of loss of business increased  and  respectively  however  the incurred losses  related to assumed excess of loss of business was less than million for the last three years 
approximately of the aggregate assumed pool business has been reinsured  all with am best rated a or better carriers 
management has been successful in commuting with several cedants and pools with respect to the assumed liabilities and continues to look for such opportunities in the future 
marketing naicc currently markets its non standard private passenger automobile insurance in california only by using one general agent that uses over sub agents to obtain applications for policies 
the general agent processed   and  applications in  and  binding  and to policies  respectively 
naicc previously wrote non standard private passenger automobile insurance directly through appointed independent agents in arizona  idaho  nevada  oregon and washington 
during it was decided to cease writing new policies for non standard private passenger automobile outside of california 
the number of appointed independent agents was reduced accordingly 
naicc  which began a preferred private passenger automobile program in california in february  marketed through a second general agent  but discontinued that program in however  certain renewals on this program were continued into by statutory requirement 
although the california automobile assigned risk plan provides for state mandated minimum levels of automobile liability coverage to be provided by insurance companies on an allocation basis to drivers whose driving records  or other relevant characteristics  make it difficult for them to obtain insurance coverage in the voluntary market  naicc does not expect to receive a material number of assignments arising from this program 
consequently  naicc does not believe that the assignments will have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
as a result of the decision to end the commercial automobile program  naicc closed its remaining sales offices in september naicc had maintained sales offices located in long beach  california  phoenix  arizona and napa  california  with each office employing a single marketing representative 
in  based on the decision to exit other lines of business  naicc closed its fresno  california and portland  oregon offices and reduced its marketing personnel in both the long beach and napa  california offices 
all remaining functions of policyholder service  renewal underwriting  policy issuance  premium collection and record retention are performed centrally at naicc s home office in long beach  california 
during  naicc marketed its non standard commercial automobile insurance through approximately independent agents located in arizona  california  idaho  nevada  oregon  utah and washington 
at the end of  naicc reduced its appointed agents to approximately compared to at the end of prior to  naicc wrote workers compensation business primarily in the states of california  oregon  arizona  idaho and montana through more than independent agents 
in july  naicc ceased writing policies in california  arizona  and nevada 
naicc stopped writing oregon and idaho polices in december valor marketed workers compensation insurance to montana employers 
all business was produced and serviced through its home office in billings  montana 
valor wrote workers compensation for employers of a wide range of hazard classifications  from banks to construction businesses  and targeted the larger employers in the state of montana 
valor began non renewing its policies in december and the company was placed into run off effective january claims all automobile claims are handled by employees of naicc at its home office in long beach  california 
claims are reported by agents  insureds and claimants directly to naicc 
claims involving suspected fraud are referred to an in house special investigation unit siu which manages a detailed investigation of these claims using outside investigative firms 
when evidence of fraudulent activity is identified  the siu works with the various state departments of insurance  the national insurance crime bureau and local law enforcement agencies in handling the claims 
workers compensation claims are received  reviewed  and processed by naicc employees located in claims service offices in long beach 
in  all of valor s pending claims were transferred to four third party administrators tpa  and in march  all claims were consolidated to one tpa 
most of naicc s policyholders are not of sufficient size or type to make a specialized managed care approach to medical cost containment more cost effective 
due to the small number of remaining workers compensation claims  claims involving suspected fraud are referred to a third party adjuster specializing in such cases 
property and casualty claims are also received  reviewed  and processed by naicc employees located in long beach 
additionally  dhc uses external consultants and attorneys to aid in determining the extent  obligation and accuracy of claims originating from stuyvesant policies issued prior to losses and loss adjustment expenses naicc s net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae represent the estimated indemnity cost and loss adjustment expenses necessary to cover the ultimate net cost of investigating and settling claims 
such estimates are based upon estimates for reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for insurance assumed  and actuarial estimates based upon historical company and industry experience for development of reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported 
any changes in estimates of ultimate liability are reflected in current operating results 
inflation is assumed  along with other factors  in estimating future claim costs and related liabilities 
naicc does not discount any of its loss reserves 
the california legislature in response to rising workers compensation costs and a lack of available market  passed assembly bill no 
ab and senate bill no 
sb on september   both of which were signed by the governor 
both bills contain many reforms designed to reduce the cost of workers compensation claims 
several of the provisions apply to medical services provided after the effective date of january   including services on injuries that occurred prior to the effective date 
as a result  the reforms are expected to have a retroactive impact and therefore affect pre established reserve levels 
the six major provisions that could have a retroactive impact on naicc s reserves are changes to the official medical fee schedule values for physician services changes to the official medical fee schedule for inpatient services pharmaceutical fee schedule outpatient surgery center fee schedule repeal of the primary treating physician presumption for pre injuries other medical treatment utilization the california workers compensation insurance rating bureau wcirb has attempted to estimate the potential savings on pre injuries due to ab and sb naicc with the assistance of external actuarial services applied the wcirb projections along with naicc specific data to calculate potential gross savings on medical reserves of million  of which the outpatient fee schedule and repeal of the treating physician presumptions had the largest impact 
the effect of these bills in the long term is somewhat uncertain due to the unknown effects it will have on all parties behaviors that contribute to the cost of the system 
additionally  new legislation  litigation and judicial interpretation may be introduced that could weaken the effect of ab and sb based upon the aforementioned actuarial projection  naicc reduced its estimate of ultimate liabilities on worker compensation claims by approximately million as of december  or approximately of its california medical net loss and allocated lae alae reserves 
the ultimate cost of claims is difficult to predict for several reasons 
claims may not be reported until many years after they are incurred 
changes in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the legal environment may also create forecasting complications 
court decisions may dramatically increase liability in the time between the dates on which a claim is reported and its resolution 
for example  punitive damages awards have grown in frequency and magnitude 
courts have imposed increasing obligations on insurance companies to defend policyholders 
as a result  the frequency and severity of claims have grown rapidly and unpredictably 
the unpaid loss and lae  related to environmental cleanup  has been established considering facts then currently known and the then current state of the law and coverage litigation 
liabilities are estimated for known claims including the cost of related litigation when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific contract of insurance or reinsurance and management can reasonably estimate its liability 
estimates for unknown claims and development on reported claims are included in naicc s unpaid loss and lae 
the liability for development of reported claims has been based on the estimates of the range of potential losses for reported claims in the aggregate 
estimates of liabilities are reviewed and updated continually and there is the potential that naicc s ultimate liabilities could be materially in excess of amounts that are currently recorded 
management believes that the provisions for unpaid losses and lae are adequate to cover the net cost of losses and loss expenses incurred to date  however  such liability is necessarily based on estimates and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such estimates 
the following table provides a reconciliation of naicc s unpaid losses and lae in thousands years ended december  net unpaid losses and lae at beginning of year    incurred losses  net  related to current years    prior years    total net incurred    paid losses  net  related to current year    prior years    total net paid    net unpaid losses and lae at december    plus reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  net    gross unpaid losses and lae at december    the net losses and lae incurred during related to prior years and were attributable to recognition of unfavorable development in the following commercial automobile of million for accident years through  workers compensation of million of which million was attributable to valor  and property and casualty of million  most of which was attributable to unallocated lae reserves 
all of the commercial automobile programs were placed in run off during the net losses and lae incurred during related to prior years and were attributable to adverse development on both the california workers compensation line totaling million  certain private passenger automobile programs totaling million  and commercial automobile totaling million 
the losses and lae incurred during related to prior years and were attributable to adverse development on both the california workers compensation line totaling million and certain private passenger automobile programs  primarily outside of california  totaling million 
all of the workers compensation lines and the private passenger automobile programs that caused higher than expected losses were placed in run off during the following table indicates the manner in which unpaid losses and lae at the end of a particular year change as time passes 
the first line reflects the liability as originally reported  net of reinsurance  at the end of the stated year 
each calendar year end liability includes the estimated liability for that accident year and all prior accident years comprising that liability 
the second section shows the original recorded net liability as of the end of successive years adjusted to reflect facts and circumstance that are later discovered 
the next line  cumulative deficiency or redundancy  compares the adjusted net liability amount to the net liability amount as originally established and reflects whether the net liability as originally recorded was adequate to cover the estimated cost of claims or redundant 
the third section reflects the cumulative amounts related to that liability that was paid  net of reinsurance  as of the end of successive years

the three year adverse development for the years ended through was related to both commercial auto and workers compensation 
the commercial auto was most significantly impacted by case strengthening related to a change in claims administration  coupled with the recognition that development factors of prior years were not as indicative of the business written for those respective years due to changes in risk profile and limits 
workers compensation was most effected by changes in legislation that occurred in that took several years to develop  with such development being different than the experience prior to the three year development for years ended through was due in part to the strengthening of the unpaid losses and lae of property and casualty businesses assumed by naicc in and workers compensation written prior to naicc recognized additional unpaid losses and lae incurred with respect to the property and casualty business of nearly million for the three year development period 
naicc has continued to post additional incurred but not reported losses ibnr despite negotiations on several commutations of assumed excess of loss reinsurance contracts that indicated previous estimates of ibnr 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of these liabilities in the past may not necessarily recur in the future especially considering that those ongoing lines that have experienced the greatest adverse development have been placed in run off in and reliance on this cumulative history may not be indicative of future performance 
reinsurance in its normal course of business  naicc reinsures a portion of its exposure with other insurance companies so as to effectively limit its maximum loss arising out of any one occurrence 
contracts of reinsurance do not legally discharge the original insurer from its primary liability 
estimated reinsurance receivables arising from these contracts of reinsurance are  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  reported separately as assets 
as of december  general reinsurance corporation genre was the only reinsurer that comprised more than of naicc s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid balances 
naicc monitors all reinsurers  by reviewing am best reports and ratings  information obtained from reinsurance intermediaries and analyzing financial statements 
at december  naicc had reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid balances from genre of million 
genre has an am best rating of a 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on reinsurance 
naicc and two of its subsidiaries participate in an inter company pooling and reinsurance agreement 
under this agreement danielson insurance company dico and danielson national insurance company dnic cede of their net liability  defined to include premiums  losses and allocated lae  to naicc to be combined with the net liability for policies of naicc in formation of the pool 
naicc simultaneously cedes to dico and dnic of the net liability of the pool 
dnic commenced participation in july and dico commenced in january additionally  both dico and dnic reimburse naicc for executive services  professional services  and administrative expenses based on designated percentages of net written premiums for each line of business 
government regulation dhc s insurance services business is highly regulated as discussed below 
regulation of insurance services business insurance companies are subject to insurance laws and regulations established by the states in which they transact business 
the agencies established pursuant to these state laws have broad administrative and supervisory powers relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  regulation of trade practices  establishment of guaranty associations  licensing of agents  approval of policy forms  premium rate filing requirements  reserve requirements  the form and content of required regulatory financial statements  capital and surplus requirements and the maximum concentrations of certain classes of investments 
most states also have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems  including acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  the terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters 
dhc and its insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding company systems pursuant to such legislation in california and montana  and routinely report to other jurisdictions 
the national association of insurance commissioners the association has formed committees and appointed advisory groups to study and formulate regulatory proposals on such diverse issues as the use of surplus debentures  accounting for reinsurance transactions and the adoption of risk based capital requirements 
it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulation on the operations of dhc or its insurance services business 
effective january   the association s codified statutory accounting principles sap had been adopted by all us insurance companies 
the purpose of such codification is to provide a comprehensive basis of accounting and reporting to insurance departments 
although codification is expected to be the foundation of a state s statutory accounting practice  it may be subject to modification by practices prescribed or permitted by a state s insurance commissioner 
therefore  statutory financial statements will continue to be prepared on the basis of accounting practice prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile 
dhc has determined that the application of the codification did not have a material impact on the statutory capital of its insurance subsidiaries upon adoption 
dividends naicc is an insurance company domiciled in the state of california and is regulated by the california department of insurance for the benefit of policyholders 
the california insurance code does not permit the payment of an extraordinary shareholder dividend without prior approval from the california insurance commissioner 
dividends are considered extraordinary if they exceed the greater of net income or of statutory surplus as of the preceding december st 
at this time and into the foreseeable future naicc does not have sufficient accumulated earned surplus to pay further ordinary dividends 
capital adequacy and risk based capital a model for determining the risk based capital rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies was adopted in december the model generally assesses dhc s assets at risk and underwriting operations and determines policyholders surplus levels to support such activity 
naicc has calculated its rbc requirement under the most recent rbc model and  as of december   it had capital in excess of any regulatory action level 
the rbc model sets forth four levels of increasing regulatory intervention company action level of an insurer s authorized control level at which the insurer must submit to the regulator a plan for increasing such insurer s capital  regulatory action level of an insurer s authorized control level  at which the insurer must submit a plan for increasing its capital to the regulator and the regulator may issue corrective orders  authorized control level  a multi step calculation based upon information derived from an insurer s most recent filed statutory annual statement  at which the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer  and mandatory control level of an insurer s authorized control level  at which the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
at december   the rbc of naicc was compared to in as discussed further in this report at item  business acl bankruptcy considerations  acl filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  it was determined that naicc s investment in acl was fully impaired for statutory accounting purposes 
at december   naicc recognized a statutory charge to its surplus of million 
this charge  when combined with naicc s underwriting results and investment losses  reduced its statutory surplus level below the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
in response  dhc repaid a million note due may to naicc  and further contributed million to naicc to increase its statutory capital during february with permission from the california department of insurance  these amounts were recorded as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes at december  after consideration for the million noted above  naicc s reported capital and surplus as of december  was above the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
in december  dhc contributed million to naicc to increase its statutory capital 
employees as of december   on a consolidated basis  dhc employed individuals  of whom two worked for dhc at the parent company level  and worked for naicc 
risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on dhc s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dhc specific risks inability to use net loss tax carryforwards one of dhc s significant assets is its nols 
in order to utilize the nols  dhc must generate taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the asset is also utilized by income from certain grantor trusts that were established as part of the mission organization 
the nols will expire if not used 
the nols further would be substantially reduced if dhc were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
dhc will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a increase in stock ownership during a three year testing period by stockholders 
in order to help dhc preserve the carryforwards  dhc s certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions designed to reduce the risk of an ownership change 
the transfer restrictions were implemented in  and dhc expects that the restrictions will remain in force as long as the nols are available 
dhc cannot be certain  however  that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change 
as of the close of  dhc had consolidated nols of million for federal income tax purposes 
the nols will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and the internal revenue service has not audited any of dhc s tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported 
additionally  management anticipates that should acl emerge from bankruptcy  while dhc will attempt to manage the tax consequences of that transaction  taxable income could result from acl debt forgiveness and asset sales and could reduce dhc s nols 
provisions in dhc s certificate of incorporation that limit ownership and transferability of dhc stock may entrench current management and the current stockholders 
dhc s certificate of incorporation generally restricts the ability of any holder of dhc common stock from disposing or acquiring shares of dhc common stock without dhc s consent 
dhc s certificate of incorporation also restricts the ability of other holders from becoming stockholders without dhc s consent 
dhc may withhold consent if the acquisition or transfer of dhc common stock would create an unreasonable risk of an ownership change 
dhc intends to vigorously challenge and pursue by all available means any attempt to violate the restrictions in dhc s certificate of incorporation 
insurance services specific risks the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition from many competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources that naicc 
there can be no assurance that naicc will be able to successfully compete in these markets and generate sufficient premium volume at attractive prices to be profitable 
this risk is enhanced by the reduction in the lines of business naicc writes as a result of it decision to reduce underwriting operations 
insurance regulations the insurance industry is highly regulated and it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulations on the operations of naicc 
if naicc s loss experience exceeds its estimate  additional reserves may be required unpaid loss and lae are based on estimates of reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for reinsurance assumed from such insurers  and historical company experience for unreported claims 
such liability is  by necessity  based on estimates that may change in the near term 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed  or even materially exceed  such estimated amount included herein 
if the ultimate liability materially exceeded estimates  then additional reserves could be required to be established by some of dhc s insurance subsidiaries 
naicc and the other insurance subsidiaries cannot provide any assurance that it or they will be able to obtain such additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
failure to satisfy capital adequacy and risk based capital requirements would require naicc to obtain additional capital naicc is subject to certain regulatory rbc requirements 
depending on its rbc  naicc could be subject to four levels of increasing regulatory intervention ranging from company action to mandatory control 
naicc s capital is also one factor used to determine its ability to distribute or loan funds to dhc 
if naicc has insufficient reserves  as determined under the risk based capital test  it will need to obtain additional capital to establish additional reserves 
naicc cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to obtain such additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
acl bankruptcy specific risks the impact of acl bankruptcy may render dhc s investment without value while the final result of acl s bankruptcy proceeding is uncertain  dhc may receive little or no value for its investment in acl upon completion of that proceeding 
in addition  as dhc locates additional acquisition opportunities  the loss of dhc s cash investment in acl may result in the need to obtain more equity capital and or debt in order to fund future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital and or debt will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
uncertainties in the bankruptcy process may adversely affect acl acl s future results are dependent upon successfully obtaining approval  confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization 
acl has not yet submitted such a plan to the bankruptcy court for approval and cannot make any assurance that it will be able to submit and obtain confirmation of any such plan in a timely manner 
failure to confirm a plan in a timely manner could adversely affect acl s operating results  as acl s ability to obtain financing to fund its operations and its relations with its customers may be harmed by protracted bankruptcy proceedings 
acl may  under certain circumstances  file motions with the bankruptcy court to assume or reject executory contracts 
an executory contract is one in which the parties have mutual obligations to perform  such as contracts of affreightment  charters  equipment leases and real property leases 
unless otherwise agreed  the assumption of a contract will require acl to cure or provide for the cure of all prior defaults under the related contract  including all pre petition liabilities 
unless otherwise agreed  the rejection of a contract is deemed to constitute a breach of the agreement as of the moment immediately preceding the chapter filing  giving the counter party a right to assert a general unsecured claim for damages arising out of the breach 
additional liabilities subject to the proceedings may arise in the future as a result of the rejection of executory contracts  including leases  and from the determination of the bankruptcy court  or agreement by parties in interest  of allowed claims for contingencies and other disputed amounts 
conversely  the assumption of executory contracts and unexpired leases may convert liabilities shown as subject to compromise to post petition liabilities 
due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential claims  acl is unable to project the magnitude of such claims with any degree of certainty 
the adverse publicity of acl s bankruptcy could adversely affect its results of operations the potential adverse publicity associated with the chapter filing and the resulting uncertainty regarding acl s future prospects may hinder acl s ongoing business activities and its ability to operate  fund and execute its business plan by impairing relations with existing and potential customers  negatively impacting the ability of acl to attract  retain and compensate key executives and associates and to retain employees generally  limiting acl s ability to obtain trade credit  and impairing present and future relationships with vendors and service providers 
uncertainties in the bankruptcy process may adversely affect the value of dhc s investment in acl currently  it is not possible to predict with certainty the length of time acl will operate under the protection of chapter  the outcome of the chapter proceedings in general  or the effect of the proceedings on the business of acl or on the interests of the various creditors and stakeholders 
under the priority scheme established by the bankruptcy code  many post petition liabilities and pre petition liabilities need to be satisfied before equity holders can receive any distribution 
dhc  directly and indirectly  holds of the equity interests in acl 
the ultimate recovery to dhc  if any  will not be determined until confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
there can be no assurance as to what value  if any  will be ascribed to dhc s equity interests in acl and the other debtors in the bankruptcy proceedings  and the value of such equity interests could be substantially or totally diluted or cancelled 
disputes among creditors could prolong the acl bankruptcy process the unsecured creditors committee appointed in the bankruptcy proceedings has the right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy court 
there can be no assurance that the unsecured creditors committee will support acl s positions in the bankruptcy proceeding or the plan s of reorganization once proposed  and disagreements between acl and the committee could protract the bankruptcy proceedings  could negatively impact acl s ability to operate during bankruptcy and could delay acl s emergence from bankruptcy 
the ongoing costs of the bankruptcy process may affect acl s results of operations and cash flows acl has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization 
the amount of these costs  which are being expensed as incurred  are expected to have a significant adverse affect on its results of operations and cash flows 
acl may not be able to reorganize in chapter additional risks associated with the reorganization of acl and its emergence from chapter include  but are not limited to  adverse developments with respect to acl s liquidity  poor results of operations limiting acl s ability to continue as a going concern  and the availability of exit financing to facilitate emergence from chapter pursuant to a plan of reorganization 
in addition  third parties could seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for acl to propose and confirm one or more plans of reorganization  appoint a chapter trustee or convert acl s cases to chapter cases for the liquidation of its businesses 
acl may not be able to repay its debt obligations as a result of acl s chapter filings  events of default under acl s senior credit facilities  senior notes  payment in kind notes and old senior notes have occurred 
however  under chapter  actions by creditors to collect claims on pre petition debt are stayed or deferred unless specifically ordered by the bankruptcy court 
if and when acl emerges from bankruptcy it is likely that it will continue to be highly leveraged with substantial debt service obligations 
acl s senior credit facilities and other indebtedness could be replaced by new credit facilities with substantial  and possibly more restrictive  covenants 
thus  acl s leveraged position could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  acl s substantial leverage position after bankruptcy could limit acl s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  increase acl s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require acl to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  limit acl s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it competes  and place acl at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors 
acl assets sales may be below current net book value in connection with the development of alternative plans of reorganization under chapter  acl will evaluate proposals to maximize the value of all acl s stakeholders  including the sale of certain of its remaining business lines 
there can be no assurance that acl will be able to consummate such asset sales or that any asset sales will be at or greater than the current net book value of such assets 
acl s liquidity is dependent on a number of factors which could adversely affect its ability to emerge from bankruptcy acl s liquidity generally depends on cash provided by operating activities and access to its debtor in possession credit facility  commonly referred to as the dip 
the ability of acl to continue as a going concern  including its ability to meet post petition obligations  and the continued appropriateness of using the going concern basis for its financial statements are dependent upon  among other things acl s ability to comply with the covenants of its dip credit facility  the ability of acl to maintain adequate cash on hand  the ability of acl to continue to generate cash from operations  confirmation of a plan of reorganization under the bankruptcy code and the terms of such plan  ability of acl to attract  retain and compensate key executives and associates and to retain employees generally  and acl s ability to achieve profitability following such confirmation 
the failure of acl to operate as a going concern and emerge from bankruptcy would result in the liquidation and sale of acl s assets which under certain circumstances could result in the imposition of statutory pension obligations against dhc

such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results  performance or achievements of dhc and its subsidiaries  or industry results  to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
statements that are not historical fact are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements can be identified by  among other things  the use of forward looking language  such as the words plan  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  project  may  will  would  could  should  seeks  or scheduled to  or other similar words  or the negative of these terms or other variations of these terms or comparable language  or by discussion of strategy or intentions

dhc cautions investors that any forward looking statements made by dhc are not guarantees or indicative of future performance 
important assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward looking statements with respect to dhc  include  but are not limited to  the risks and uncertainties affecting the businesses described in item although dhc believes that its plans  intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from a projection or assumption in any of its forward looking statements 
dhc s future financial condition and results of operations  as well as any forward looking statements  are made only as of the date hereof and dhc does not have or undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  subsequent events or otherwise  unless otherwise required by law 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and significant events dhc is organized as a holding company with substantially all of its current operations conducted in the insurance services industry 
dhc also has investments in companies engaged in the marine services industry which  beginning in  are accounted for under the equity method 
however  as a result of the consummation of the covanta acquisition on march   the future performance of dhc will predominantly reflect the performance of covanta s operations which are significantly larger than dhc s insurance operations 
as a result  the nature of dhc s business  the risks attendant to such business and the trends that it will face will be significantly altered by the acquisition of covanta 
accordingly  dhc s prior financial performance will not be indicative of its future performance 
in addition to the risks attendant to the operation of the covanta energy and water businesses in the future and the integration of covanta and its employees into dhc  the ability of dhc to utilize its nols to offset income generated by the covanta operations will have a material affect on dhc s financial condition and results of operations 
dhc  on a parent only basis  has continuing expenditures for administrative expenses and derives revenues primarily from investment returns on portfolio securities 
therefore  the analysis of dhc s financial condition is generally done on an operating subsidiary basis 
as of december   dhc had approximately million in federal tax nols 
dhc s strategic and business plan is to acquire businesses that will allow dhc to earn an attractive return on its investments 
in may  dhc acquired a ownership interest in acl thereby entering into the marine transportation  construction and related service provider businesses 
on january   acl and certain of its subsidiaries and its immediate direct parent entity  acl holdings  filed a petition with the us bankruptcy court to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
accordingly  dhc wrote off its remaining investment in acl at the end of the first quarter of as an other than temporary asset impairment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing  while dhc continues to exercise influence over the operating and financial policies of acl  it no longer maintains control of acl 
accordingly  for the year ended december   dhc has accounted for its investments in acl  gms and vessel leasing using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  dhc reports its share of the equity investees income or loss based on its ownership interest 
as a result of acl s continued losses and dhc management s belief that it may recover little  if any  of its investment in acl  dhc wrote off its remaining investment in acl at the end of the first quarter of as an other than temporary asset impairment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since dhc wrote of its investment in acl in and did not have any marine services operations in and  since neither dhc nor the other marine services subsidiaries gms and vessel leasing are guarantors of acl s debt nor are they liable for any of acl s liabilities  the commentary included in this item with respect to the financial condition and results of operations of marine services is limited 
an expanded discussion and analysis would not reflect dhc s current or future operations and  accordingly  would not be meaningful 
insurance operations the only active insurance products currently being sold by dhc s insurance subsidiaries are in the california non standard personal automobile insurance line 
other than run off of other lines and insurance that naicc is statutorily required to offer  naicc is not actively operating any other lines of insurance business due to unfavorable loss development and capital requirements 
naicc s objective with respect to its remaining business is to underwrite business that is expected to yield an underwriting profit 
as of july   naicc ceased writing new policy applications for commercial automobile insurance and began the process of providing the required statutory notice of its intention not to renew existing policies 
naicc expects that by september it will have completely exited the commercial automobile marketplace 
taxes dhc does not currently pay regular federal income tax due to its nols and the recognition of losses from several trusts that assumed various liabilities of certain present and former subsidiaries of dhc 
it is expected that dhc s consolidated federal income tax return will report a cumulative nol currently estimated at million  which will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and exclusive of the trusts activities  dhc has generated cumulative taxable losses both historically and during the prior three years 
over the past several years  dhc s insurance operations have been generating losses exclusive of net investment income  net realized gains and the trusts activities 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  insurance services year ended december  compared with year ended december  the change in net earned premiums during those years is directly related to the change in net written premiums 
net written premiums were million and million in and  respectively 
net earned premiums exceeded net written premiums in due to the decision to cease writing in several lines of business as noted above 
the overall decrease in net written premiums for over the comparable period in was attributable to a significant reduction in naicc s commercial automobile line and the decision made in to exit both the workers compensation line of business in all states and private passenger automobile outside of california 
workers compensation net written premiums decreased by million during over the comparable period in the commercial automobile net written premiums decreased from million in to million in due to the decision to exit the line in july net written premiums for personal automobile lines decreased by million during primarily due to underwriting restrictions placed on the non standard california private passenger automobile program and the decline in net written premiums outside of california 
premium and fees receivable  net of allowances  decreased by million or 
the decrease in was attributable to naicc s decision to significantly reduce underwriting operations by exiting the commercial automobile line and placing underwriting restrictions on the california non standard private passenger automobile line 
the million net decrease in the allowance for premiums and fees receivable during was primarily attributable to the write off of million of outstanding balances from and against the allowance 
these write offs were partially offset by an increase in the allowance of million during naicc made changes to its commercial auto installment plans for policies written in  which improved overall collection rates 
the net increase in the allowance for premiums and fees receivable during of million was attributable to the increase in installment written premiums during prior to the decision to contract underwriting operations in the commercial automobile line 
as a result  naicc increased both its allowance for premiums and the amount written off against such allowance during net investment income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the fixed income portfolio basis as well as a reduction in the portfolio yield 
fixed income invested asset portfolio decreased by million in  despite net loss and lae reserves declining by million 
the differential was a result of naicc disposing of substantially all of its equity security holdings in the th quarter of and reinvesting those proceeds  approximately million  in fixed income securities 
additionally  naicc received from dhc million in additional paid in capital at year end 
due to the decrease in written premiums on business placed in run off noted above  naicc also experienced negative underwriting cash flows 
as of december  and  the weighted average yield on naicc s portfolio was and  respectively 
the effective duration of the portfolio at december  was years which management believes is appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all lines of business 
in  naicc recognized million in gains from fixed income securities that were maturing in as a consequence of a dynamic interest rate environment throughout the year 
in  a realized investment gain of million was recognized upon conversion of the acl notes into equity 
this gain  was offset by a million loss on non affiliated equity securities and a million gain on fixed maturities 
of the million loss on equity securities  million was recorded for other than temporary declines in fair value 
naicc had a net unrealized loss of million on its equity portfolio at the end of december and a modest net unrealized gain at december  net losses and lae ratios were in and in the increase in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to further recognition of prior accident year reserve development on workers compensation and commercial automobile insurance 
naicc has historically priced its non standard private passenger and commercial auto premium at to of its expected loss and allocated loss adjustment expense alae costs in order to balance its expense structure and market conditions 
in  naicc believed it had a far more successful underwriting year  posting loss and alae ratios of and for its california non standard auto and entire commercial auto program 
these results were commensurate with industry results for driven primarily by the hard insurance market 
non standard private passenger and commercial auto claim frequency was and vehicles per claim in accident year compared to and in  respectively 
severity was favorable for both lines as well in compared to by reduction of average cost per claim of and for the personal and commercial auto lines  respectively 
although both these indicators were favorable in  the average premium per vehicle on commercial lines had the most significant effect on the loss and alae ratio 
the average premium per vehicle on commercial lines increased for the accident year 
with respect to the personal automobile insurance  the mix of business moving towards non owner policies in versus in had the most significant impact 
historically non owner policies yield loss and alae ratios to basis points lower than owner policies 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net earned premiums were in and in policy acquisition costs include expenses which are directly related to premium volume ie  commissions  premium taxes and state assessments as well as certain underwriting expenses which vary with and are directly related to policy issuance 
the modest decrease was a result of change in the mix of business and a favorable renegotiation by naicc of its commission structure with its general agent in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to recording an additional allowance for uncollectable reinsurance recoverable of million and million in employee severance expenses related to business contraction 
exclusive of the two items noted above  expenses decreased million compared to due to decreased production and previously implemented cost containment efforts 
naicc continues to examine its expense structure  however  given the decision to reduce net writings and its obligation to run off several lines of business  a core amount of fixed governance costs is required and consequently its expense ratio will be higher than industry averages until it can increase premium production 
parent company only investment income and administrative expense year ended december  compared with year ended december  investment income 
total parent company investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ending december  primarily due to recognition of million in gain on acl bonds owned by dhc that were contributed as part of the purchase price of acl holdings recognized during administrative expense 
parent company administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december as compared to million for the year ended december the decrease is primarily due to a reduction of facility and payroll related costs 
in  dhc entered into a corporate services agreement with equity group investments  llc egi 
samuel zell  the chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president of dhc  is also the chairman of egi and philip tinkler  chief financial officer of dhc  is also an executive officer of egi 
egi provided financial and administrative services to dhc 
subsequent to the acl acquisition in  acl provided similar support services to dhc 
interest expense year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  interest expense in was due to the accrual of one month of interest on the bridge financing required for the covanta acquisition 
interest expense in was primarily due to acl s and gms interest expense after the acquisition 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated marine services subsidiaries year ended december  compared with year ended december  as a result of acl s bankruptcy filing  while dhc continues to exercise influence over the operating and financial policies of acl  it no longer maintains control of acl 
accordingly  for the year ended december   dhc has accounted for its investments in acl  gms and vessel leasing using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  dhc reports its share of the equity investees income or loss based on its ownership interest 
as a result of acl s continued losses and dhc management s belief that it may recover little  if any  of its investment in acl  dhc wrote off its remaining investment in acl during the first quarter of the equity in net loss of unconsolidated marine services subsidiaries included a loss from acl of million  an other than temporary impairment of the remaining investment in acl of million  and income from gms and vessel leasing of million 
the gms and vessel leasing investments are not considered to be impaired 
the marine services subsidiaries operating results in were consolidated in dhc s operating results from the date of acquisition  may   through december   but were deconsolidated in as a result of acl s bankruptcy 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  insurance services year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decline in net earned premiums is directly related to the change in net premiums written 
net written premiums were million and million in and  respectively 
net earned premiums exceeded net written premiums in due to the decision to cease writing in several lines of business as noted above 
the overall decrease in net written premiums for over the comparable period in is attributable to significant reduction in naicc s commercial automobile line and the decision made in to exit both the workers compensation line of business in all states and private passenger automobile outside of california 
workers compensation net written premiums decreased by million during over the comparable period in the commercial automobile net written premiums decreased from million in to million in due to curtailed underwriting activity 
net written premiums for personal automobile lines increased by million during primarily due to premium growth in the non standard california private passenger automobile programs in excess of the decline in net written premiums outside of california  coupled with non renewing its quota share reinsurance agreement on the california business 
premium and fees receivable  net of allowances  decreased by million or 
the decrease is attributable to the decision to significantly reduce naicc s underwriting operations 
prior to that decision  naicc experienced significant growth in installment premiums related to its commercial automobile program during naicc s automobile programs have installment features on policy terms in excess of six months 
premiums from the automobile program that generally offer policy terms less than six months and do not utilize installment plans increased in the effect of these trends was to magnify the overall decrease in installment premium receivable during the increase in the allowance for premiums and fees receivable during of million was attributable to the increase in installment premiums during prior to the decision to contract underwriting operations in the commercial automobile line 
in conjunction with the increase in installment premiums during  naicc experienced an increase in collection efforts relating to such premiums 
as a result  naicc increased both its allowance for premiums and the amount written off against such allowance during net investment income was million in compared to million in the net investment income decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the fixed income portfolio 
the fixed income invested asset portfolio decreased by million in such decrease was attributable to the conversion of million of acl notes into equity 
as a result of the decrease in written premiums on business placed in run off noted above  naicc also experienced negative underwriting cash flows 
as of december  and  the average yield on naicc s portfolio was and  respectively 
the estimated average duration of the portfolio at december  was years compared to years at december  net realized investment gains were relatively comparable due to the gain recognized on the conversion of acl bonds to equity 
otherwise the net realized losses of and gains in were consistent with the general economic trends for those periods 
the net loss and lae ratios were in and in the increase in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to higher than expected losses in the california private passenger automobile and commercial automobile programs totaling million and million  respectively 
in addition  naicc had significant adverse development in the california workers compensation line and non california private passenger automobile 
adverse development on prior accident years recognized for workers compensation in was million 
the adverse development for prior accident years related to the private passenger automobile lines placed in run off was million 
adverse development on prior accident years recognized for workers compensation in totaled million 
the adverse development for prior accident years related to the private passenger automobile lines placed in run off was million 
as a percentage of net earned premiums  policy acquisition expenses were in and in the decrease in the policy acquisition expense ratio in  compared to  was due to a reduction of marketing costs of million primarily as the result of the decision in to exit those lines mentioned above 
general and administrative expenses decreased in due to previously implemented cost containment efforts 
general and administrative expenses in also included million in amortization of goodwill expense 
as a percentage of net earned premiums  general and administrative expenses were in and in the decrease in reflects decreased production in and the effect of cost saving measures implemented during the ratio included an additional million of costs associated with the decision to contract naicc s underwriting operations 
those costs included employee severance payments of approximately million and a write off of goodwill of approximately million 
these costs added to the ratio 
marine services year ended december  compared with year ended december  acl follows a week fiscal year ending on the last friday in december of each year 
marine services operating revenues and operating expenses in consisted of acl  gms and vessel leasing operating revenues and expenses since the date of acquisition may  
parent company only investment income and administrative expense year ended december  compared with year ended december  investment income 
total parent company investment income increased to million for the year ending december as compared to million for the year ending december primarily due to recognition of million in gain on acl bonds owned by dhc that were contributed as part of the purchase price of acl holdings 
administrative expense 
parent company administrative expense increased million to million for the year ending december  as compared to million for the year ending december the increase was primarily due to expense for stock options  which were modified as of july   one time increases in management compensation related to the resignation of certain dhc management in connection with its acquisition of acl  higher directors fees and additional insurance expense 
prior to the acquisition of acl and shortly thereafter  dhc shared certain personnel and facilities with several affiliated and unaffiliated companies that had certain common directors and officers  and certain expenses were allocated among the various entities 
personnel costs were allocated based upon actual time spent on dhc business 
costs relating to office space and equipment were allocated based upon actual usage 
management believes the methodology used for allocation was appropriate 
total expenses included million in and million in related to expenses allocated to dhc from affiliated entities 
interest expense year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to no interest expense for the year ended december  primarily due to acl s and gms interest expense after the acquisition 
outlook naicc management expects that the business environment in california non standard personal auto to remain favorable 
it appears there are fewer markets to place non standard risks  which aided naicc in to raise rates and renew of its policyholders in naicc expects a similar renewal rate for naicc expects the hard market to continue in as new entrants are priced reasonably and ongoing programs are tightening underwriting guidelines while a few are filing rate increases 
the decision to exit the commercial auto market will negatively impact naicc as it loses operating leverage on its general and administrative expenses and will have less earned premium during a relative hard market cycle 
with the passage of ab and sb  which was intended to serve to contain medical costs for the struggling california workers compensation market  naicc is anticipating these measures and future legislation will mitigate the adverse development trend previously recognized 
naicc will continue to aggressively pursue commutations on the stuyvesant business but as there has been an influx of newly reported a e claims over the last three years  naicc s ability to discharge these risks will be more difficult 
naicc is evaluating other strategies to further segregate these liabilities from the active entities that could promote commutations 
naicc has come to rely upon its investment income to mitigate the shortfall on underwriting results  but as it continues to experience negative cash flow due to its operations that are in run off and year lows in interest rates  naicc does not expect to receive the same level of investment income  as in and prior 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the same period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
naicc estimates reserves for unpaid losses and lae based on reported losses and historical experience  including losses reported by other insurance companies for reinsurance assumed  and estimates of expenses for investigating and adjusting all incurred and unadjusted claims 
key assumptions used in the estimation process could have significant effects on the reserve balances 
naicc regularly evaluates their estimates and assumptions based on historical experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends 
changes in the unpaid losses and lae can materially effect the statement of operations 
different estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period based on the economic conditions 
since the loss reserving process is complex and subjective  the ultimate liability may vary significantly from our estimates 
the insurance services group has claims for environmental clean up against policies issued prior to the unpaid loss and lae related to environmental cleanup has been established considering facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation 
due to the factors discussed above and others  the process used in estimating unpaid losses and lae cannot provide an exact result 
dhc s results of operations for each of the past three years have been adversely affected by insurance loss development related to prior years of million  million and million for  and  respectively
