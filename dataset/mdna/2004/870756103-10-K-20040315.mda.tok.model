item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
overview we operate the largest fleet of truckload carrier equipment in the united states 
as part of the truckload segment of the trucking industry  we transport freight for shippers in large quantities who generally pay for our services based upon the number of miles between pick up and delivery 
our fleet of tractors and trailers is as follows as of december  tractors company owned leased total company owner operator total average tractors trailers total tractors owned and leased includes tractors being prepared for service and tractors waiting to be returned under lease or resold at the end of our replacement program 
average tractors is calculated on a monthly basis and represents tractors available for dispatch 
our tractors are either owned by us or financed under leases 
our fleet has operated on a three year cycle for many years 
generally  we traded a tractor for a new tractor every three years 
after evaluating the tractor engines  which were designed to conform to the emissions standards mandated by the us environmental protection agency epa that became effective on october   we have decided to operate the majority of our equipment for a minimum of four years 
furthermore  we may operate some equipment for five years depending upon mileage and use of the equipment 
the owner operators own their tractor and are responsible for operating costs for example fuel and maintenance 
the owner operators operate under our authority and are generally compensated based upon miles 
we believe that owner operators provide swift with a noticeably higher return on our invested assets because owner operators incur the cost of acquiring their tractor  not swift 
trucking revenue is generated from freight hauled by our fleet 
there are three factors that significantly impact our trucking revenue 
first  as mentioned above  the truckload industry in which we operate is generally compensated based upon miles 
therefore  an increase in miles will increase the revenue 
we monitor utilization of our tractors in the form of miles per tractor per week 
the second factor is revenue per mile 
increases in revenue per mile will increase revenue 
we monitor our revenue per mile on a daily basis 
finally  the percentage of miles our tractors travel that do not generate revenue  known as deadhead  will adversely affect revenue 
we monitor deadhead miles on a daily basis 
in addition to trucking revenue  our operating revenue includes fuel surcharge revenue and other revenue primarily for freight moved for our customers on rail or purchased transportation 

table of contents we are also compensated  in some instances  for accessorial charges such as loading and unloading freight for our customers 
the department of transportation dot  recently revised their regulations to increase the maximum daily drive time from to hours  but no longer allow for breaks in the on duty period 
in situations where productivity losses could occur as a result of these regulations  we expect to seek compensation from the shippers and in turn compensate our drivers and owner operators accordingly so as to maintain our existing pay structure 
if we are not successful in working with our shippers to adjust for the impact these new regulations will have on our driver and owner operator productivity  it could have a negative impact on our financial results 
see factors that may affect future results and financial conditions regulation for information on this and other regulatory matters 
we believe our cost structure is evenly divided between fixed costs  such as overhead and variable costs  such as driver wages  purchased transportation and fuel 
therefore  an increase in revenue will generally improve our financial results through a reduction in our operating ratio 
we have communicated our goal to reduce our operating ratio by this year 
based on our current view of the first quarter  we expect to fall significantly below our improvement objective due to adverse weather  early retirement charges  driver availability and higher fuel cost 
in  our net earnings rose to million as trucking revenue increased and we were able to absorb more of our fixed costs 
in  our net earnings increased to million 
although trucking revenue was down from  lower interest expense  the lack of integration adjustments  and merger related synergies all contributed to our rise in net earnings 
in the first quarter of  we offered a voluntary early retirement option to selected employees 
this program includes a severance payment  acceleration of stock options and cobra insurance coverage 
we estimate the one time pretax expense of this program  to be recognized in the first quarter of  will be approximately million 
furthermore  we expect to realize a reduction in salaries and benefits of approximately million annually 
critical accounting estimates claims accruals we are self insured for a portion of our liability  property damage and cargo damage risk 
this self insurance results from buying insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
each reporting period we accrue the cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
revenue recognition operating revenues and related direct costs are recognized as of the date the freight is picked up for shipment 
ms carriers see pooling of interests note recognized revenue on the date freight was delivered 
beginning january   ms carriers was operationally combined with us and recognizes revenue on the date freight is picked up for shipment 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with method two under eitf we do not believe the financial results derived from the application of this method differ materially from the results that would be derived under method three discussed within eitf due to our relatively short length of haul 
we have discussed the methodology of these accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this annual report on form k 

table of contents pooling of interests on june   we acquired ms carriers through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with and into ms carriers the merger 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all historical financial data discussed below has been restated to include the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of ms carriers 
in addition  the results for include a million increase to ms carriers insurance and claims reserves  a million adjustment  of which million relates to the impairment of our equity investment held by ms carriers in transportes easo  the largest intra mexico truckload carrier  and million is associated with the write off of a cash advance made to easo in the third quarter of  and a million adjustment for the change in market value of the interest rate derivative agreements of ms carriers 
prior to the merger  ms carriers calculated a range of claims reserves and recorded in their financial statements an amount that they believed was appropriate 
we believed  based upon our experience with historical development trends  it was more appropriate to record amounts at a higher level within the range 
upon closing the merger with ms carriers  we completed our evaluation of the claims exposure of ms carriers and recorded a million increase in this accrual 
ms carriers held the equity investment in transportes easo prior to its merger with us 
nothing came to our attention to indicate there was an impairment of this investment during the acquisition process or the period subsequent to the merger and prior to the august request from transportes easo management for an advance to meet its cash requirements 
the million cash advance to transportes easo was made in august as a result of this advance  we began an evaluation of this investment 
based upon our evaluation  it was our determination that there had been a significant decline in the value of easo and that our investment in it was impaired 
therefore  we adjusted the carrying value of the investment 
results of operations for  and the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain statement of earnings data as a percentage of operating revenue for the years ending december operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits operating supplies and expenses fuel purchased transportation rental expense insurance and claims depreciation and amortization communications and utilities operating taxes and licenses total operating expenses operating income net interest expense other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings 
table of contents revenue as discussed above  we believe there are three factors that have a significant impact on our trucking revenue 
these three factors  along with operating revenue and its components dollars in thousands are shown in the table below for the last three years 
trucking revenue fuel surcharge revenue other revenue operating revenue miles per tractor per week revenue per loaded mile deadhead percentage our trucking revenue increased by approximately in compared to and decreased in compared to in  we improved our utilization  revenue per loaded mile and deadhead percentage 
our acquisition of merit distribution services  inc accounted for of this increase in services provided to our largest customer  wal mart  generated of our revenue in comparing to  the improvement in deadhead percentage was offset by a decrease in utilization 
we began with approximately trucks without drivers 
the number of trucks without drivers decreased throughout and we ended the year with approximately trucks without drivers 
other revenue increased in both and primarily due to an increase in freight moved for our customers on rail and third party carriers for our customers 
operating expenses our most significant operating costs are salaries  wages and employee benefits  fuel and purchased transportation 
our salaries  wages and employee benefits were  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage was fairly consistent after adjusting for fuel surcharge revenue  in and in the percentage decreased slightly in when compared to as we experienced some driver attrition that was offset by an increase in workers compensation costs 
our deductible amount for workers compensation rose from zero to  per incident in in  this deductible amount for workers compensation rose from  to  per incident 
the deductible will rise in to  however  we believe that the decrease in the cost of our premiums based on a  deductible will more than offset the cost of claims that occur within the  to  range  which has historically been a small number 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent we did not obtain corresponding rate increases 

table of contents fuel was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
this percentage is primarily affected by fuel prices 
fuel as a percentage of revenue is directly related to our average fuel cost per gallon  which was  and  in  and  respectively 
increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases or fuel surcharges  would have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we believe that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available 
we do not use derivative type hedging products  but periodically evaluate their possible use 
purchased transportation was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
this percentage increased in as our owner operator fleet has increased from  at december  to  at december  and our use of rail increased 
operating supplies and expenses was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively  as we experienced an increase in maintenance costs 
this anticipated increase resulted from our extensions of the life of some of our tractors into the fourth year beginning in late  which increased maintenance costs 
this increase is offset by a reduction in depreciation expense discussed below 
insurance and claims was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
the year ended december  includes a million increase to ms carriers insurance and claims reserves and million of increased insurance premiums  with the same coverage  over the prior year 
as discussed under critical accounting estimates  we are self insured for some portion of our liability  property damage and cargo damage risk 
we buy insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
beginning in  the deductible amount for general liability rose from  to  per incident 
this increase in our deductible was a part of the settlement agreement between us and our insurance company that is discussed in the following paragraph 
we believe that the benefits we will receive from the insurance settlement outweigh that the additional costs that will result from a higher deductible 
this expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
as we discussed in the notes to our financial statements  we entered into a settlement agreement with our insurance company that carries a portion of our transportation liability insurance 
pursuant to this settlement  the insurance company agreed to provide certain insurance coverage  at no cost to the company  through december  in exchange for our releasing all claims that were the subject of the litigation 
we have been recognizing this settlement amount as a reduction of insurance expense as the insurance coverage is provided during the period from july  through december  in addition  we deferred the million of legal expenses  which were paid pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement based upon our estimate of the value of the insurance provided of between million and million 
these legal expenses are being amortized on a straight line basis over the thirty month period beginning july  in the event that we do not receive the future insurance coverage due to the liquidation  rehabilitation  bankruptcy or other similar insolvency of the insurers  we will receive a reimbursement of our legal expenses on a declining basis ranging from million through december  to million through july  rental expense was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in our average cost per leased tractor and a decrease in the number of tractors on lease 
depreciation and amortization expense was  and of operating revenue in  and the decrease in is primarily due to the extension of the life of some of our tractors into the fourth year 
at the acquisition date of tractors  we estimate the expected life and depreciate the cost over this expected life to the expected residual value 
historically  for most of our tractors  the expected life is three years 
when we chose to extend the life an additional year  the depreciation for that additional year is equal to the change in the expected residual value 
as with most depreciating assets  the loss in value in later years is less when compared to the earlier years of an asset s life 

table of contents when it is economically advantageous to do so  we will purchase and then resell tractors that we currently lease by exercising a purchase option contained in the lease 
gains on these activities are recorded as a reduction of rental expense 
we also generate gains from the sale of tractors we own 
these gains are recorded as a reduction of depreciation expense 
these gains are summarized below 
in thousands gain on sale of leased tractors gain on sale of owned tractors other expenses our largest pre tax non operating expense is interest 
our debt balance combining the operating line of credit  accounts receivable securitization  capital leases  senior notes and other debt was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
as shown below  our interest expense  net of the impact of the derivative agreements  increased in in june  we completed our private placement of senior notes  which have a weighted average interest rate of 
although this fixed rate is currently higher than our variable rate debt  these senior notes provide us with strategic capital with five and seven year maturities 
we also benefited in from lower interest rates and a shift in borrowings from more costly debt related to capital leases  entered into under ms carriers  to less costly swift debt 
our interest expense decreased in as we shifted to lower cost borrowings and interest rates declined 
in thousands interest expense increase decrease in derivative agreements interest expense  net of derivative agreements included in other income expense are the equity earnings of transplace and tran mex 
an additional nonrecurring charge of million within the earnings of our equity investment in transplace was recorded in other expense in included an million adjustment for the impairment of the equity investment held by ms carriers in transportes easo  and the equity loss of million for transplace 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the higher rate in was primarily due to the nondeductible portion million of the easo impairment adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flow sources and uses by operating  investing and financing activities are shown below in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities the increase in our net earnings in was the primary driver of our increase in cash provided by operating activities 
in  our cash provided by operating activities increased slightly compared to  despite a substantial increase in net earnings primarily because our accounts receivable increased by a comparable amount 
our cash used in investing activities is mainly driven by our capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds 
our capital expenditures  net of cash sales proceeds were million  million and million in  
table of contents and  respectively 
in addition  we expended million for the purchase of merit distribution  inc in and we made loans to investment entities totaling million in regarding our financing activities  in we issued million of senior notes and repaid million of debt  net of borrowings under the line of credit including capital leases and securitization 
also  we repurchased million and million of our common stock in and in addition  we received million and million in stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds in and  respectively 
in  we repaid a total of million of long term debt  capital leases and borrowings under revolving credit agreement and received million from our public stock offering and million from issuance of stock to our employees 
as of december  and we had a working capital deficit of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the accounts receivable securitization is reflected as a current liability because the committed term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
the funds received under the accounts receivable securitization are generally used for capital expenditures or repurchases of our common stock 
therefore  our working capital will be reduced by the amount of the proceeds received under the accounts receivable securitization but the increase in fixed assets or treasury stock is not included in working capital 
as of december   we had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding on our million line of credit  leaving million available 
interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon one of two options  which we select at the time of borrowing the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins ranging from to basis points  as defined in the credit agreement currently basis points 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a commitment fee ranging from to basis points currently basis points 
the credit agreement requires us to meet certain covenants with respect to leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and tangible net worth 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain unencumbered assets of not less than of indebtedness as defined 
our accounts receivable securitization allows us to sell up to million of our eligible trade accounts receivable to a financial institution 
as of december   we had received sales proceeds of million 
under the terms of our agreement  of our trade receivables collateralize the securitization arrangement as of december  as of december   we had commitments outstanding to acquire replacement and additional revenue equipment for approximately million 
we have the option to cancel such commitments upon days notice 
we believe we will be able to support these acquisitions of revenue equipment through debt and lease financings and cash flows generated by operating activities 
we historically have had a three year replacement program on the majority of our line haul tractors 
after evaluating the tractor engines  which were designed to conform to the emissions standards mandated by the us environmental protection agency epa that became effective on october   we have decided to operate the majority of our equipment for a period of four years 
furthermore  we may operate some equipment for five years depending upon mileage and use of the equipment 
this change has caused a deferral of our revenue equipment purchases during the past two years 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of non revenue equipment capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for facilities  facilities related improvements and equipment 
we anticipate that we will expend approximately million in for various facilities upgrades and acquisition and development of terminal facilities 
factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures 
we believe we will be able to finance needs for working capital  facilities improvements and expansion  as well as anticipated fleet growth  with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the line of credit  
table of contents accounts receivable securitization and with long term debt and lease financing believed to be available to finance revenue equipment purchases 
over the long term  we will continue to have significant capital requirements  which may require us to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of debt financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and other factors over which we have little or no control 
safety rating update our safety rating has always been and continues to be satisfactory  the highest rating given by federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa 
an october compliance review by the arizona division of the fmcsa has resulted in a proposed safety rating of conditional 
we have been in discussions with the fmcsa about the proposed rating and filed a petition for a stay of the effective date of the proposed safety rating pending a review as provided for under the fmcsa regulations 
our petition for a stay was granted by the fmcsa on december  and the arizona division of the fmcsa was ordered to respond to swift s petition for review 
we received this response on january  and submitted our reply on february  although the scope of the compliance review involved many areas within the authority of the fmcsa  there is only one issue in dispute 
this area involves the accuracy of the documentation of driving logs maintained by our drivers and owner operators 
we anticipate a positive outcome 
we have always maintained safety as a top priority and have a comprehensive internal audit program for review of driver log compliance 
in addition  we regulate the speed of our tractors and vigorously enforce a company speed limit that is lower than many state speed limits 
no operational safety issues have been raised by the fmcsa compliance review 
there are three safety ratings assigned to motor carriers satisfactory  which we have historically maintained  conditional  which means that there are deficiencies requiring correction  but not so significant to warrant loss of carrier authority  and unsatisfactory  which is the result of acute deficiencies and would lead to revocation of carrier authority 
even when a carrier temporarily drops to conditional status  it does not lose its carrier authority or ability to transport hazardous materials 
federal regulations do not preclude a carrier from transporting hazardous materials unless the carrier has an unsatisfactory safety rating 
there are  however  certain standard industry provisions in our contracts with our customers that could allow a customer to reduce or terminate its relationship with us if we do not have a satisfactory rating 
in addition  there is a possibility that conditional rating could affect our ability to self insure for personal injury and property damage claims relating to the transportation of freight which could increase our cost of insurance 
based upon internal data  external data  and consultation with our regulatory counsel  we believe that if our rating were changed to conditional  it would be temporary and any loss of revenue would not be material 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in the commitments note to the financial statements  we have guaranteed certain financing arrangements of trans mex in which we hold equity interests 
these guarantees were issued to assist trans mex when entering into its financing arrangements 
in january  we completed an acquisition of an additional interest in trans mex 
after this acquisition  we own of this company and as a result it will be consolidated in our financial statements 
furthermore  the company guarantees certain residual values under its operating lease agreements for revenue equipment 
at the termination of these operating leases  the company would be responsible for the excess of the guarantee amount over the fair market value  if any 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company would be required to make under these guarantees is million  although management does not believe it is likely that we will ultimately be required to fund any material amount of these guarantees 
the company utilizes operating leases as an additional financing source 

table of contents contractual obligations the tables below summarize our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations fair value of interest rate swaps total contractual obligations we expect to refinance the million line of credit included in long term debt upon maturity 
operating leases include an interest element within the commitment amount as opposed to the long term debt and capital lease obligations amounts  which do not include an interest element 
deferred taxes and long term portion of claims accruals are excluded from other long term obligations in the table above 
the table excludes purchase commitments for revenue equipment which are cancellable 
subsequent event acquisition of trans mex  inc we completed the acquisition of an additional interest in trans mex  inc sa de sa in january after this acquisition  we own of this mexican truckload carrier 
the purchase price for this interest was million consisting of million in cash and  shares of common stock 
we have agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for these shares within the next days 
trans mex is one of the top five international trucking companies operating in mexico 
through this acquisition  we become the only united states trucking company with a ownership interest in a mexican carrier 
we utilize trans mex as a provider of freight services for our customers and we paid trans mex million in  which is included in purchase transportation on the consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation would cause interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs to increase and would adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to successfully provide truckload carrier services to meet dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
general economic and business factors 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry and significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  license and registration fees and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges 
the results of operations also are affected by 
table of contents recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail  manufacturing and paper products in which there is a concentration of customers 
in addition  the results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
competition 
the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with railroads 
there are some trucking companies with which we compete that have greater financial resources and carry a larger volume of freight 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
we depend on cash from operations  operating leases and debt financing for funds to expand the size of our fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
if we were unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it would limit our growth 
difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
if we are unable to continue to attract drivers or contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
acquisitions 
our growth has been dependent  in part  upon the acquisition of trucking companies throughout the united states 
to date  we have been successful in identifying trucking companies to acquire and in integrating such companies operations into our operations 
we may face competition from transportation companies or other third parties for acquisition opportunities that become available 
there can be no assurance that we will identify acquisition candidates that will result in successful combinations in the future 
any future acquisitions by us may result in the incurrence of additional debt  which could adversely affect our profitability  or could involve the potentially dilutive issuance of additional equity securities 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilation of the acquired company s operations particularly in the period immediately following the consummation of such transactions  the diversion of the attention of management from other business  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
many of our executive officers are key to the management of our business and operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain these officers and other capable managers 
although we believe we could replace key personnel given adequate prior notice  the unexpected departure of key executive officers could cause substantial disruption to our business and operations 
in addition  we may not be able to retain and recruit talented personnel without incurring substantial costs 
regulation 
we are regulated by the united states department of transportation 
this regulatory authority exercises broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
we may also become subject to new or more comprehensive or restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions and ergonomics 
the increased cost of complying with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
recently  a compliance review by the arizona division of the federal motor carrier safety division fmsca resulted in a proposed rating status for swift of conditional 
there are three possible ratings assigned by fmsca satisfactory  conditional and unsatisfactory 
the proposed drop in our rating status relates to the accuracy of the documentation of driving logs maintained by our drivers and owner operators 
we have appealed this rating and petitioned fmsca for a review of our rating status 
until this review is complete  our the conditional rating is stayed and our rating remains satisfactory 
if fmsca ultimately determines our safety rating to be conditional it could result in certain material adverse consequences to our business and operations 
although a conditional rating will not result in the loss of our authority to transport hazardous materials  certain industry standard provisions in our contracts with our customers could allow the customer to reduce or 
table of contents terminate its relationship with us 
if a significant customer or large number of smaller customers  or combination thereof  reduce or terminate their relationship with us  it would have a material adverse affect on our business 
in addition  there is a possibility that a drop to conditional status could affect our ability to self insure for personal injury and property damage relating to the transportation of freight  which could cause our insurance costs to increase 
in addition  our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of stormwater and underground fuel storage tanks 
if we should be involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in january  the department of transportation adopted new regulations concerning the maximum number of hours of service that commercial truck drivers may operate 
the revised regulations increased the maximum daily drive time from to hours  but no longer allow for breaks in the on on duty period 
these changes could reduce the time that a driver is available to drive as a result of the calculation of the on duty period and productivity losses could occur with respect to our business 
if we are unsuccessful in working with our shippers to adjust for the impact of these new regulations  it could have a negative impact on our financial results 
used equipment market 
we rely on the sale of used equipment to offset the cost of purchasing new equipment 
in the past three years  used tractor values have deteriorated significantly 
should this trend continue  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
claims exposure  insurance 
we currently self insure for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  workers compensation  and property damage  and maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above our limits on self insurance 
to the extent we were to experience an increase in the number of claims for which we are self insured  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs  to the extent not offset by freight rate increases  would reduce our profitability 
dependence on key customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from key customers 
during  our top  and customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
our largest customer  wal mart accounted for of our revenues in we do not have long term contractual relationships with many of our key customers  and there can be no assurance that our relationships with our key customers will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have interest rate exposure arising from the line of credit million  variable rate capital lease obligations million and the accounts receivable securitization million  all of which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of variable rate debt  fixed rate lease financing and million notional amount of interest rate swaps weighted average rate of 
the fair value of our long term debt approximates carrying values 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense by million
