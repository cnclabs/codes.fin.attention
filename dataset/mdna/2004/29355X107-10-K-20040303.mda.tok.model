item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
year ended december  in millions  except per share data statement of operations data sales income loss from continuing operations balance sheet data total assets long term debt including current portion mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of trust tides per common share data diluted income loss from continuing operations n a n a n a the tides are convertible primarily into the common stock of another registrant  ie  goodrich  and therefore  are no longer deemed to be a convertible preferred security 
the tides have been classified as long term debt subsequent to the distribution 
because our results were consolidated into the results of goodrich prior to the distribution  per share amounts do not apply to periods prior to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains certain statements that are forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the securities and exchange commission 
the words may  hope  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  continue  and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
we believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our shareholders  and we therefore make forward looking statements in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the act 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control  and our actual results may differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we advise you to read further about certain of these and other risk factors set forth under the caption certain risk factors that may affect future results 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  either as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
whenever you read or hear any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributed to us or any person acting on our behalf  you should keep in mind the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section 
the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview enpro was incorporated on january   as a wholly owned subsidiary of goodrich in anticipation of goodrich s distribution of its engineered industrial products eip segment  which took place on may  the distribution 
we are leaders in the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of well recognized  proprietary engineered industrial products that include sealing products  self lubricating  non rolling  metal polymer bearing products  air compressor systems and vacuum pumps  and heavy duty diesel and natural gas engines 
we also design  manufacture and sell other engineered industrial products such as ptfe products and specialized tooling 
we manage our business as two segments  a sealing products segment sealing and ptfe products and an engineered products segment metal polymer bearings  air compressor systems  heavy duty diesel and natural gas engines and specialized tooling  which encompass our primary product lines 
on september   we acquired the glacier metal polymer bearings business glacier  which is now part of our ggb operation 
the results of glacier s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
the combination of our pre existing bearings business and glacier created the largest manufacturer of self lubricating  non rolling  metal polymer bearings in the world 
the addition of glacier has had a significant effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the following discusses our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition after the distribution and coltec s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition as it operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of goodrich prior to the distribution  including the adjustments and allocations necessary for a fair presentation of the business 
prior to the distribution  coltec owned the eip business as well as an aerospace business 
the transfer of coltec s aerospace business to goodrich prior to the distribution constituted the disposal of a segment under apb opinion no 
accordingly  coltec s aerospace business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and its revenues  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities and cash flows have been segregated in the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains only to continuing operations 
following the distribution  coltec became a wholly owned subsidiary of enpro and coltec s former aerospace business is owned by goodrich 
the following discussion of the consolidated results of operations does not necessarily include all of the expenses that would have been incurred by coltec prior to the distribution had it been a separate  stand alone entity and may not necessarily reflect what coltec s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition would have been had coltec been a stand alone entity prior to the distribution or what our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be in the future

we do not include income taxes  interest expense or interest income in the determination of segment profit 
corporate expenses include general corporate administrative costs 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those for enpro 
compared to sales increased in to million compared to million in stronger foreign currency rates  particularly the euro  increased sales year over year 
excluding the effect of foreign currency rates  sales declined during  primarily due to fewer engine shipments at fairbanks morse engine 
sales at all other operations were flat year over year in the aggregate 
the timing of engine shipments can have a significant effect on sales levels  although the relatively low profitability has a limited impact on our segment profit 
part of the volume decline also was due to the divestiture of certain low margin operations in late and early the decline in engine shipments was mitigated by increased demand by the heavy duty trucking industry for sealing and related products 
this market has shown improvement throughout  especially in the oem sector 
segment profit was million in  which was a improvement over the million reported in the largest contributor to the increase in segment profit was stronger foreign currency rates 
excluding the effect of favorable currency rates  segment profit increased compared to this improvement resulted from lower restructuring expenses  cost reductions and a warranty claim that reduced earnings in these improvements were partially offset by a less profitable product mix 
segment margins improved to in from in corporate expenses increased to million in compared to million in corporate expenses in consisted of five months of goodrich headquarters expense allocations and seven months of our corporate expenses as an independent public company subsequent to the distribution 
the goodrich allocations were lower than our expenses have been as a public company 
asbestos related expenses of million in decreased from million in the expenses in included a million write off of an asbestos insurance receivable as a result of a bankruptcy filing by the parent company of one of garlock s insurers 
the remaining decrease is primarily the result of recoveries from insolvent insurance carriers in the total of net interest expense and distributions on tides decreased from million in to million in the decrease is primarily the result of the reduction in the coltec senior notes  which were retained by goodrich in connection with the distribution 
refer to the results of operations compared to discussion below for additional information regarding the reduction in the coltec senior notes and the classification of the distributions on tides 
in  we purchased call options on goodrich common stock to provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides into goodrich common stock could exceed their liquidation value 
the call options are a derivative instrument and are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value are reflected in income  but do not affect cash flows 
the fair value of the call options increased in by million 
other income in included the combined gains of million on the sales of two buildings  and a million gain on a partial purchase of the tides 
refer to the results of operations compared to discussion below for information regarding the other expenses 
following is a discussion of the operating results for each segment 
sealing products 
sales increased in to million from million in excluding the positive impact of the stronger foreign currency rates  sales increased only in stemco contributed to the increase as a result of improved aftermarket activity and oem production order levels in the heavy duty truck market  which continues to improve from a low point in in addition  sales at garlock rubber technologies increased in due to increased volume 
sales at garlock sealing technologies were flat after excluding the effects of exchange rates 
plastomer technologies sales declined compared to due to the divestiture of two low margin product lines 
segment profit increased to million in compared to million in segment profit increased excluding the positive translation effect of foreign currency rates 
this increase was primarily a result of increased margins at stemco  cost reductions  and warranty and other unfavorable reserve adjustments in that did not recur in segment margins increased from in to in engineered products 
sales were million in  which was higher than the million in sales were down compared to excluding the positive effects of foreign currency rates  which improved sales at ggb and france compressor products 
this decrease was mainly due to lower engine shipments by fairbanks morse engine to both commercial customers and the us navy 
excluding the favorable foreign currency rates  sales at ggb  quincy compressor  france compressor products and haber sterling were essentially flat year over year 
in  segment profit increased to million from million in segment profit increased only in excluding the translation effect of exchange rates 
this increase was mainly due to positive events regarding a legal and warranty claim that led to the reduction of related accruals  and lower restructuring expenses at fairbanks morse engine 
excluding the favorable foreign currency rates  segment profit at ggb  quincy compressor  france compressor products and haber sterling were down due to increased costs compared to compared to sales in of million were higher than in  when they were million 
the increase in sales was primarily due to the addition of glacier and increased engine sales at fairbanks morse engine 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales in the sealing products segment 
the increased sales volume  the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with new accounting rules  and cost reductions growing out of restructuring measures implemented late in and throughout were primarily responsible for the increase in segment profit from million in to million in goodwill amortization in was approximately million  before tax 
increased operating expenses  such as pension and insurance expenses  together with margin deterioration caused by competitive pricing pressures and a greater mix of lower margin business  reduced the benefit of the higher sales volumes and lack of goodwill amortization in as a result  margins decreased to in from in  mainly due to these factors 
corporate expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of our becoming an independent public company 
prior to the distribution  corporate expenses consisted of an allocation of goodrich headquarters expenses 
asbestos related expenses were million in  which was higher than the million incurred in in  we wrote off asbestos insurance receivables amounting to million as a result of a bankruptcy filing by the parent company of one of garlock s insurers 
in addition  asbestos related expenses  exclusive of this receivable write off  increased by million in as compared to due to higher costs associated with managing and settling asbestos claims 
interest expense declined from million in to million in mainly due to the reduction in the outstanding principal amount of the coltec senior notes 
all but million of the original million of coltec senior notes were exchanged for similar goodrich senior notes prior to the distribution 
goodrich retained the new goodrich senior notes subsequent to the distribution 
the total of the mark to market adjustment for the call options and other expenses was million in compared to million in the expenses increased mainly due to the following in connection with the distribution  we conducted a review of our process for managing and estimating environmental liabilities 
as a result of changes in our strategies growing out of this review  and in light of recent developments at a number of environmental sites associated with previously divested businesses  we increased our environmental liabilities by million to reflect an increase in the estimated costs to remediate these sites 
the increased costs will be paid over a number of years and therefore should not significantly impact our short term liquidity 
based on new information obtained during the year  we revised the estimated costs associated with an adverse court ruling during related to severance owed as a result of the closing of a plant in we increased our retained liabilities of previously owned businesses for this case by million 
in december  million was paid in connection with this liability 
in  we purchased call options on goodrich common stock to provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversion of the tides into goodrich common stock could exceed the liquidation value of the tides 
the call options are a derivative instrument and are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value are reflected in income 
the fair value of the call options declined by million during the year 
as mentioned above  we treat the tides distributions as interest expense after the distribution 
therefore  only five months of the tides distributions  amounting to million  are separately reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount for the other seven months  million  is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  coltec separately reported the annual amount of the tides distributions  amounting to million  in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we completed our initial assessment of goodwill using the two step approach described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas we tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value  including goodwill 
we determined the fair value based on the discounted present value of estimated future cash flows 
since the carrying value of the assets of certain reporting units in the sealing products segment exceeded their fair value  we then made a comparison between the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  and the carrying value of the goodwill 
we determined that goodwill related to the sealing products segment was impaired and  as required by sfas  we reduced goodwill by million million  net of tax to its implied fair value 
we recorded the reduction as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as required by sfas  we restated the first quarter ending march   to reflect the cumulative effect of the adoption of this accounting principle 
we previously evaluated goodwill for impairment by comparing the entity level unamortized goodwill balance to projected undiscounted cash flows  which did not result in an indicated impairment 
following is a discussion of the operating results for each segment 
sealing products 
sales decreased to million in compared to million in sales at garlock sealing technologies were down as this operation experienced weakness in most of the process industry markets that it serves in the americas 
garlock sealing technologies sales in europe and in certain industries  such as the us steel industry  were flat 
stemco sales in were higher than in due to a rebound in demand for new heavy duty trucks as a result of pre buying in advance of new epa emissions standards in the latter part of  and an increase in new heavy duty trailer builds from historically low levels in demand for plastomer technologies ptfe products  which declined in  was negatively impacted by weakness in the aerospace  semiconductor manufacturing and chemicals markets 
decreased sales of commercial rubber products at garlock rubber technologies contributed to a decrease in revenue from to segment profit fell from million in to million in the decrease in segment profit was primarily a result of the lower sales volumes at certain businesses noted above  pricing pressure at garlock sealing technologies and plastomer technologies  the recording of a reserve for a warranty claim  and increased pension and insurance costs 
these unfavorable changes were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization million  cost reductions from restructuring activities in late and throughout  increased margins at stemco  and improved operating performance at garlock rubber technologies 
operating margins for the segment decreased from in to in engineered products 
sales were million  a increase over the million reported in segment profit increased from million in to million in operating margins for the segment were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in operating margins was mainly due to increased volume in lower margin product lines and increased costs for pensions and insurance  partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization million 
a increase in sales volumes and cost reductions at fairbanks morse engine contributed significantly to the segment results 
a full year of results for glacier  acquired in september and now part of our ggb operation  accounted for most of the increase in segment sales 
on a pro forma basis as if the glacier acquisition had occurred on january   segment sales in would have been million higher resulting in only a increase in segment sales in ggb experienced pricing pressure in its key markets in the americas and europe  and weakness in its key european markets  partially offset by stronger demand in in its american markets 
this resulted in an overall decrease in ggb s operating margins 
improved demand from automotive programs boosted haber sterling s sales by  which together with restructuring costs in that did not repeat in and cost reductions from these restructuring activities  led to improved operating margins for this operation 
weak capital equipment and industrial markets in negatively impacted demand at quincy compressor resulting in a sales decline 
the decrease in volume and cost increases resulted in lower operating margins at quincy compressor 
france compressor products sales and segment profit were essentially unchanged from restructuring and impairment costs see note in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of restructuring and impairment costs in  and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities 
note  overview  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical because some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped or services are rendered 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
asbestos we record an accrual for asbestos related matters that are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated  which consist of settled claims and actions in advanced stages of processing 
we also record an asset for the amount that we expect our subsidiaries will recover from insurance 
in accordance with internal procedures for the processing of asbestos product liability actions and due to the proximity to trial or settlement  certain outstanding actions progress to a stage where we believe we can reasonably estimate the cost to dispose of these actions 
these actions are classified as actions in advanced stages 
with respect to outstanding actions that are in preliminary procedural stages  as well as any actions that may be filed in the future  we believe that insufficient information exists upon which judgments can be made as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions 
therefore  we believe that it is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy or reasonableness what  if any  potential liability or costs may be incurred 
accordingly  no estimate of future liability has been recorded for such claims 
see contingencies asbestos  in this management s discussion and analysis and note in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of asbestos matters 
tides  derivative instruments and hedging activities upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we elected not to apply the provisions of the statement to embedded derivatives existing before january   as permitted by the transition provisions of the statement 
as a result  the feature of the tides that allows them to be converted into goodrich common stock is not accounted for separately as a derivative 
we purchased call options on shares of goodrich common stock with an exercise price of per share the conversion price  in an amount that would be required if all tides holders convert 
the call options provide for either an adjustment to the exercise price or a cash payment  at our option  if there is a change in the cash dividends paid on goodrich common stock 
we also have entered into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge forecasted transactions occurring at various dates through december that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the contracts is reported in other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is reported in income 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified into income in the period that the hedged transactions affect earnings 
pensions and post retirement benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and assumed health care cost trend rates 
assumptions are determined based on data available to us and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a material effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements  as well as amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
lower market interest rates led to a reduction in the discount rate during to 
the expected return on plan assets was held constant at  reflecting the long term performance of our plan investments 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements  including the respective expected dates of adoption  and the effects on results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  if any 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows operating activities provided million and million in and  respectively  and used million in over the past two years  inventory reductions have provided million of cash 
this is the second consecutive year that inventories have shown a significant reduction as a result of our focus on total customer value tcv lean manufacturing 
also contributing to the upward trend in operating cash flows during these periods was the trend toward lower asbestos related expenditures net of insurance collections 
in  and  asbestos related expenditures exceeded proceeds from asbestos related insurance by million  million and million  respectively 
asbestos related expenditures and the associated insurance is discussed further under contingencies asbestos  included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
investing cash flows we used million  million and million in investing activities in  and  respectively 
our recurring investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures 
we also used million of cash in to acquire the pikotek sealing product line and another smaller specialty sealing product line 
in  we purchased call options on goodrich common stock for cash payments totaling million to provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides could exceed the tides liquidation value 
in  we used approximately million to acquire glacier and a small product line addition in the engineered products segment 
the increase in capital expenditures in each year reflects a decision to increase investments in our operations and to support tcv lean manufacturing projects aimed at improving customer satisfaction  cost reductions and restructuring our operations 
financing cash flows financing activities provided million  million and million in  and  respectively 
financing cash flows in were limited mainly to a partial purchase of the tides for approximately million in cash  and a borrowing against a promissory note to fund certain pre retirement death benefits for our executive officers 
prior to the distribution in  our cash disbursements and cash receipts were managed in a corporate cash concentration system 
we describe this activity as net transfers to from goodrich in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
under this process  goodrich provided million of cash in that was used primarily to fund operating cash requirements  including asbestos related expenditures  capital expenditures  a portion of the call options paid prior to the distribution  and to increase our cash balance as of the date of the distribution 
cash also was provided in from a borrowing against a promissory note in connection with funding certain pre retirement death benefits for our executive officers 
as mentioned earlier under results of operations compared to  subsequent to the distribution  the distributions on the tides are treated as interest expense 
therefore  only the two quarterly tides distribution payments made prior to the distribution are reflected as a financing activity 
tides distributions made after the distribution are reflected in operating cash flows as a reduction of income loss from continuing operations 
goodrich provided million of cash in  which was used for the glacier acquisition and to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures 
capital resources our primary us subsidiaries executed a credit agreement dated may   for a senior secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility are collateralized by receivables  inventories  equipment  intellectual property  insurance receivables and all other personal property assets of enpro and its us subsidiaries and by a pledge of of the capital stock of their direct foreign subsidiaries 
the maximum available amount under the facility is million 
during  we amended this facility to reduce the cost and modify certain restrictions and covenants in order to provide the company with increased flexibility 
we do not expect compliance with these restrictions and covenants to materially affect our operations 
we have not borrowed against this credit facility 
coltec has outstanding approximately million of tides due april  during  we purchased million of the outstanding tides for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
the tides are convertible at the option of the holder into a combination of of a share of goodrich common stock and of a share of enpro common stock 
should the holders exercise their right to convert the tides  coltec would be required to deliver shares of goodrich and enpro common stock to the holders as promptly as practicable after the conversion date 
the value of goodrich and enpro common stock may increase to a level where coltec s cost to acquire shares in a conversion could exceed  with no maximum  the million aggregate liquidation value 
coltec has purchased call options on shares of goodrich common stock with an exercise price of per share the conversion price  in an amount that would be required if all tides holders convert 
until they expire in march  the call options provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides could exceed the tides liquidation value 
the call options are derivative instruments and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value reflected currently in our earnings 
such changes may have a material effect on our results of operations in a given period  but will not result in any cash obligation 
while we have hedged our exposure to conversion costs in excess of the aggregate liquidation value of the tides as described earlier  we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to redeem these securities or effectively hedge this exposure beyond the term of the call options 
in  we executed a million variable rate promissory note in connection with certain pre retirement death benefits payable to our executive officers 
the promissory note is collateralized by life insurance policies and a certificate of deposit 
the promissory note bears interest at libor plus a margin of  which was at december   and is adjusted annually 
the promissory note is payable at the earliest of termination of the policies  death of persons insured under the policies  or sixty days prior to the expiration of the policies 
this is the second promissory note of this type  each having similar terms and conditions 
the total outstanding for these promissory notes was million as of december  goodrich offered to exchange new goodrich debt securities for outstanding coltec senior notes prior to the distribution 
goodrich acquired million of coltec senior notes tendered pursuant to the offer 
the million of coltec senior notes that remained outstanding following completion of the exchange offer continue to be obligations of coltec 
our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity is constrained because it might cause the distribution to be taxable under section e of the internal revenue code and we have agreed to indemnify goodrich for any tax due if our actions cause such a tax 
dividends the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility as well as the terms of the tides impact directly or indirectly our ability to pay dividends 
the senior secured revolving credit facility contains limitations on dividend payments 
in connection with the tides  coltec is entitled to withhold interest payments to coltec capital trust for up to quarters 
if these interest payments are withheld  coltec would be unable to pay dividends to enpro  which could limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders during this period 
contingencies general there are pending or threatened against enpro or its subsidiaries various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings  all arising in the ordinary course of business with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  which seek remedies or damages 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are also involved as plaintiffs in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection  environmental and other matters 
gain contingencies  if any  are recognized when they are realized 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the us and foreign countries 
we take a proactive approach to addressing the applicability of all environmental  health and safety laws as they relate to our manufacturing operations and to proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we believe that we  and our subsidiaries  are in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations 
we  or one of our subsidiaries  have been notified that we are among the potentially responsible parties under environmental laws for the cost of investigating and  in some cases  remediating contamination by hazardous materials at sites at each of which the costs to us are expected to exceed thousand 
the majority of these sites relate to remediation projects at former operating facilities that have been sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater remediation 
investigations have been completed for sites and are in progress at two sites 
the laws governing investigation and remediation of these sites can impose joint and several liability for the associated costs 
liability for these costs can be imposed on present and former owners or operators of the properties or on parties that generated the wastes that contributed to the contamination 
our policy is to accrue environmental investigation and remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the measurement of the liability for each site is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical data and legal information 
we initiate corrective and preventive environmental projects in an effort to ensure safe and lawful operations at our facilities 
we also conduct comprehensive compliance and management system audits at our facilities to maintain compliance and improve operational efficiency 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet includes an accrued liability of million for probable future expenditures relating to environmental sites 
the accrued liability includes a partial indemnification of environmental liabilities of crucible materials corporation crucible  a former coltec subsidiary 
coltec could be deemed responsible for additional environmental costs as a previous owner of crucible if crucible is unable to pay its share of these costs 
although we are pursuing insurance recovery in connection with certain of these matters  no receivable has been recorded with respect to any potential recovery of costs in connection with any environmental matter 
actual costs to be incurred for identified situations in future periods may vary from estimates because of the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and government regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
colt firearms and central moloney we have contingent liabilities related to divested businesses for which certain of our subsidiaries retained liability or are obligated under indemnity agreements 
these contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  potential product liability and associated claims related to coltec s former colt firearms subsidiary for firearms manufactured prior to its divestiture in and coltec s former central moloney subsidiary for electrical transformers manufactured prior to its divestiture in no material product liability claims are currently pending against coltec related to colt firearms or central moloney 
colt firearms has been named as a defendant in cases filed by municipalities seeking to recover costs arising from gun related injuries 
many of those cases have been dismissed or are inactive 
colt firearms is seeking indemnification from coltec for these claims to the extent they involve firearms manufactured prior to march we have rejected colt firearms claims for indemnification relating to the municipal gun cases in all instances on various legal grounds 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses in the consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of these operations 
crucible materials corporation through our coltec subsidiary  we own of the outstanding common stock of crucible through an irrevocable non voting trust the ownership trust 
crucible  which is engaged primarily in the manufacture and distribution of high technology specialty metal products  was a wholly owned subsidiary of coltec until the ownership trust expires in may  at which time coltec will own the crucible common stock directly 
under the terms of the ownership trust  coltec has not participated in the management of crucible s affairs and we have exercised no influence over the ongoing activities and business strategies of crucible 
based on an evaluation of the recoverability of our investment in crucible s common stock  the investment is valued at zero in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  due to the lack of any oversight of crucible s activities  and due to the uncertainty surrounding the future recoverability of our investment in crucible  we do not include our proportionate share of crucible s net income loss in our results of operations 
a portion of the remaining of the shares of crucible are owned by crucible sponsored pension and profit sharing plans and the crucible employee stock ownership plan 
as crucible s employees retire  they are entitled to redeem those shares and be paid the fair value of the shares by crucible 
in addition  provided certain conditions are met  crucible s pension plans have the right to sell their shares of crucible common stock to crucible 
when shares are purchased by crucible  the shares are retired and coltec s percentage ownership in crucible increases 
if coltec s percentage ownership of crucible s common stock were ever to exceed  coltec may be deemed to be a controlling person with respect to the crucible pension funds 
as such  coltec could be subject to certain liabilities with respect to crucible s pension obligations 
if crucible s pension plans were to be terminated and the plans assets were not sufficient to cover the plans liabilities  crucible and all members of its controlled group would be responsible for the unfunded termination liability 
to the extent that crucible could not fund any shortfall  coltec and enpro could become responsible for funding the shortfall 
the combined fair value of the assets in crucible s pension plans was approximately million less than the accumulated benefit obligations at december  this amount is subject to change as the market value of the assets and interest rates fluctuate  as employees benefits change based on either plan amendments or additional credited service  and if contributions are made to the plans 
in addition  in the event of a plan termination  the calculation of the actual termination liability would be based on more conservative interest rate assumptions and the deficit would likely be higher than the amount reflected above 
coltec s ownership of crucible s common stock might never exceed and coltec might never become part of a controlled group 
in addition  crucible s pension plans might never be terminated and coltec might never bear any liability for any unfunded termination liability 
in conjunction with the closure of a crucible plant in the early s  coltec was required to fund two irrevocable trusts for retiree medical benefits for union employees at the plant 
the first trust the benefits trust pays for these retiree medical benefits on an ongoing basis 
coltec has no continuing connection to the benefits trust  and thus the assets and liabilities of this trust are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
under the terms of the trust agreement  the trustees retained an actuary to assess the adequacy of the assets in the benefits trust in  and another actuarial report will be required in and if  at either or both of the future valuation dates  it is determined that the trust assets are not adequate to fund the payment of the medical benefits  coltec will be required to contribute additional amounts 
based on preliminary information  an additional contribution in is not anticipated 
in the event there are ever excess assets in the benefits trust  those excess assets will not revert to coltec 
because of the possibility of future contributions to the benefits trust  coltec was required to establish a second trust the back up trust to cover potential shortfalls in the benefits trust 
the assets and liabilities of the back up trust are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in other non current assets and in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses  respectively  and amounted to million each at december  if the actuary determines that there are excess assets in the back up trust at the benefits trust valuation dates  the excess assets will revert to coltec based on a distribution formula and will be recorded in income upon receipt 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses in the consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters  in addition to those mentioned previously  that relate to its period of ownership of crucible 
debt and capital lease guarantees as of december   we had contingent liabilities for potential payments on guarantees of certain debt and lease obligations totaling million 
these guarantees arose from the divestiture of crucible and central moloney and expire at various dates through there is no liability for these guarantees reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that crucible or central moloney does not fulfill its obligations under its debt or lease agreements  we could be responsible for these obligations 
asbestos history 
certain of coltec s subsidiaries  primarily garlock sealing technologies  llc garlock and the anchor packing company anchor  are among a number of defendants typically to and sometimes more than in actions filed in various states by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
among the products at issue in these actions are industrial sealing products  predominantly gaskets and packing products 
the damages claimed vary from action to action and in some cases plaintiffs seek both compensatory and punitive damages 
to date  neither garlock nor anchor has been required to pay any punitive damage awards  although there can be no assurance that they will not be required to do so in the future 
liability for compensatory damages has historically been allocated among all responsible defendants 
since the first asbestos related lawsuits were filed against garlock in  garlock and anchor have processed more than  asbestos claims to conclusion including judgments  settlements and dismissals and  together with their insurers  have paid more than million in settlements and judgments at a cost in fees and expenses of an additional million 
claims mix 
of those claims resolved  less than have been claims of plaintiffs alleging the disease mesothelioma  approximately have been claims of plaintiffs with lung or other cancers  and more than have been claims of plaintiffs alleging asbestosis  pleural plaques or other impairment of the respiratory system 
because the more serious disease cases tend to work through the system more quickly than the non malignancy cases and the cases filed by those who are not impaired  we believe that the disease mix in our current open caseload  on a percentage basis  is even more skewed toward pleural plaques and includes a large number of claims made by plaintiffs who have suffered no disease and have no measurable impairment of any kind 
in fact  while there are many cases in our current open caseload about which we have no disease information  we are aware of only approximately  that involve a claimant with mesothelioma  lung cancer or some other cancer 
product defenses 
the asbestos containing products formerly sold by garlock and anchor were encapsulated  which means the asbestos fibers were incorporated into the product during the manufacturing process and sealed in a binder 
they are also nonfriable  which means they cannot be crumbled by hand pressure 
the us occupational safety and health administration  which began generally requiring warnings on asbestos containing products in  has never required that a warning be placed on products such as garlock s gaskets 
notwithstanding that no warning label has been required  garlock included one on all of its asbestos containing products beginning in further  gaskets such as those previously manufactured and sold by garlock are one of the few asbestos containing products still permitted to be manufactured under regulations of the environmental protection agency 
since the mid s  us sales of asbestos containing industrial sealing products have not been a material part of garlock s sales and sales of asbestos containing products have been predominantly to sophisticated purchasers such as the us navy and large petrochemical facilities 
these purchasers generally have extensive health and safety procedures and are familiar with the risks associated with the use and handling of industrial sealing products that contain asbestos 
garlock discontinued distributing asbestos containing products in the us during and worldwide in mid garlock s product defenses enabled it to win defense verdicts in four of the five cases that it tried to verdict in those trials were in california  kentucky two and texas 
in all four cases  the jury determined that garlock s products were not defective and that garlock was not negligent 
in november  a cuyahoga county  ohio jury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of million to the family of a year old deceased mesothelioma patient who alleged exposure to garlock asbestos containing products during his year career as a steamfitter 
garlock was the only defendant who tried the case to verdict but is entitled to credit for the amount of monies paid to the plaintiff by defendants who settled before or during trial 
post trial motions are pending with the judge  and garlock intends to appeal the verdict if it stands 
garlock and its attorneys believe it is probable that the verdict will be set aside on appeal and a new trial ordered 
settlements 
garlock settles and disposes of actions on a regular basis 
garlock s historical settlement strategy has been to try to match the timing of payments with recoveries received from insurance  which  as described later  were limited by agreement to million per year through the second quarter of this limit increased by to million per year million per quarter beginning in the third quarter of in and  garlock implemented a short term aggressive settlement strategy 
the purpose of this short term strategy was to achieve a permanent reduction in the number of overall asbestos claims through the settlement of a larger than normal number of claims  including some claims not yet filed as lawsuits 
mainly due to this short term aggressive settlement strategy  but also because of a significant overall increase in claims filings  the settlement amounts paid in each of the years through were greater than the amounts paid in any year prior to in  garlock resumed its historical settlement strategy 
in fact  garlock reduced new settlement commitments from million in to million in  million in  and million in because many of the commitments made in   and early will be paid over a number of years  the settlement amounts that garlock will pay in and will continue to include amounts for those settlements 
settlements are made without any admission of liability 
settlement amounts vary depending upon a number of factors  including the jurisdiction where the action was brought  the nature and extent of the disease alleged and the associated medical evidence  the age and occupation of the plaintiff  the presence or absence of other possible causes of the plaintiff s alleged illness  the availability of legal defenses  and whether the action is an individual one or part of a group 
before any payment on a settled claim is made  the claimant is required to submit a medical report acceptable to garlock substantiating the asbestos related illness and meeting specific criteria of disability 
in addition  sworn testimony or other evidence that the claimant worked with or around garlock asbestos containing products is required 
the claimant is also required to sign a full and unconditional release of garlock  its subsidiaries  parent  officers  directors  affiliates and related parties from any liability for asbestos related injuries or claims 
when a settlement demand is not reasonable given the totality of the circumstances  garlock generally will try the case 
garlock has been successful in winning a substantial majority of the cases it has tried to verdict 
garlock s share of adverse verdicts in these cases in the years through totaled approximately million in the aggregate  and some of those verdicts are on appeal 
as previously reported  garlock won defense verdicts in four of the five cases it tried to verdict in  and the verdict against it in the other is under review 
status of anchor 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
the remaining insurance coverage available to anchor is fully committed 
anchor has not committed to settle any actions since as cases reach the trial stage  anchor is typically dismissed without payment 
insurance coverage 
the insurance coverage available to garlock is substantial 
as of december   garlock had available million of insurance coverage from carriers that it believes to be solvent 
garlock classifies million of otherwise available insurance as insolvent 
we believe garlock will recover some of the insolvent insurance over time 
in fact  garlock recovered million from insolvent carriers during and million during of the solvent insurance  million is with us based carriers whose credit rating by s p is investment grade bbb or better  and whose am best rating is excellent a or better  million is with other solvent us carriers and million is with various solvent london market carriers 
of the million  million is allocated to claims that have been paid by garlock and submitted to its insurance companies for reimbursement and million has been committed to claim settlements not yet paid by garlock 
thus  as of december   million remains available for future asbestos related settlements 
arrangements with garlock s insurance carriers limit the amount of insurance proceeds that it is entitled to receive in any one year 
the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos related payments by garlock was limited to million per year through the second quarter of this limit increases by every three years and now is at million per year million per quarter 
because garlock from time to time collects some insolvent insurance and because some of garlock s carriers pay as if there were no annual limit  garlock receives amounts in excess of the cap amount in some periods 
amounts paid by garlock in excess of insurance recoveries in any year that would be recoverable from insurance but for the limit may be collected from the insurance companies in subsequent years so long as insurance is available  subject to the annual limit available in each subsequent year 
to the extent that garlock pays such amounts in a given year  these payments are recorded as a receivable 
the amounts paid in excess of insurance recoveries in that were recorded as a receivable amounted to million 
garlock is pursuing various options  such as raising the annual limit  commuting policies at discounted values  and pursuing insolvent coverages  to reduce or eliminate the gap between payments by garlock and recoveries received from insurance carriers 
there can be no assurance that garlock will be successful as to any or all of these options 
garlock is involved in a dispute with some of its london market carriers and one of its us carriers that has some policies reinsured through the london market 
the london carriers unilaterally have asserted documentation requirements that are not required in the insurance funding agreement  and have withheld payment pending satisfaction of those requirements 
garlock has demanded payment in accordance with the terms of the agreement and has initiated arbitration of the issue 
in  garlock collected enough funds from insolvent carriers million  and from carriers who pay at full billing  as if there were no annual limit million  to more than offset the late payments million from the delinquent carriers 
as garlock pursues resolution of the dispute with these carriers  we anticipate that asbestos cash outflows in the first half of will be much higher than in the first half of however  we anticipate that we will resolve the dispute later in the year and that  for the year  asbestos cash outflows will be lower than in the carriers involved will owe garlock approximately million of the million due under the cap agreement in  in addition to the million of delinquent payments 
in november  coltec received a letter and arbitration demand from one of its insurers claiming that the insurer was relieved of liability on a million coltec policy in connection with a settlement and payment in full by a related insurer of a million anchor policy 
coltec disputes this contention and intends to vigorously pursue the coverage in the arbitration 
the million policy is included in the million of investment grade us based coverage 
insurance coverage for asbestos claims is not available to cover exposures initially occurring on and after july  garlock and anchor continue to be named as defendants in new actions  a few of which allege initial exposure after july  to date  no payments have been made with respect to these claims  pursuant to a settlement or otherwise 
in addition  garlock and anchor believe that they have substantial defenses to these claims and therefore automatically reject them for settlement 
however  there can be no assurance that any or all of these defenses will be successful in the future 
quantitative claims information 
in accordance with internal procedures for the processing of asbestos product liability actions and due to the proximity to trial or settlement  certain outstanding actions against garlock have progressed to a stage where we believe we can reasonably estimate the cost to dispose of these actions 
these actions are classified as actions in advanced stages and the estimated costs to dispose of them are included in the table below 
with respect to outstanding actions against garlock that are in preliminary procedural stages  as well as any actions that may be filed in the future  we believe that insufficient information exists upon which judgments can be made as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions 
therefore  we believe that it is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy or reasonableness what  if any  potential liability or costs may be incurred 
accordingly  we have not included any estimate of future liability for such claims in the table below 
we record an accrual for liabilities related to garlock and anchor asbestos related matters that are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated  which consist of settled claims and actions in advanced stages of processing 
we also record an asset for the amount of those liabilities that we expect garlock and anchor to recover from insurance 
a table is provided below depicting quantitatively the items discussed above 
as of and for the year ended december  number of cases new actions filed during the period open actions at period end dollars in millions at period end estimated amounts recoverable from insurance estimated liability for settled claims and actions in advanced stages of processing dollars in millions payments insurance recoveries net cash flows consists only of actions actually filed with a court of competent jurisdiction 
each action in which both garlock and anchor are named as a defendant is shown as a single action 
the numbers of new actions do not include approximately  claims paid in and approximately  claims paid in that were previously settled as part of inventory settlements and never filed as lawsuits 
at december   included million representing cumulative payments made for which garlock has not received a corresponding insurance recovery due to the annual limit imposed under garlock s insurance policies  and which will be recovered in future periods to the extent insurance is available 
also included at december   is million representing amounts recoverable under insurance policies related to the estimated liability for settled claims and actions in advanced stages of processing 
at december   we classified million as a current asset and million as a non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets 
includes amounts with respect to all claims committed in the period  whether or not an action has actually been filed with a court of competent jurisdiction 
at december   we classified million as a current liability and million as a non current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
includes amounts with respect to all payments for claims settlements and expenses and recoveries made in the period 
in the years ended december   and  we added million  million  and million  respectively  of the net cash flows to the asbestos insurance receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  and we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the number of new actions filed increased considerably in the first six months of from the first six months of  compared to 
we believe that the numbers were much higher than they otherwise would have been because of tort reform efforts in general and in mississippi and texas in particular 
in the second half of  the number of new actions was much lower than in the comparable period  compared to 
in fact  the number of new actions in the second half of was the lowest for any six month period since strategy 
garlock s current strategy is to focus on trial listed cases and other cases in advanced stages of processing  to reduce new settlement commitments each year  to accelerate insurance collections  and to proactively support legislative and other efforts aimed at asbestos reform 
garlock believes that this strategy should continue to result in the reduction of the negative annual cash flow impact from asbestos claims  as previous settlements work their way through the payment process 
garlock believes that  as predicted in various epidemiological studies that are publicly available  the incidence of asbestos related disease should decline steadily over the next decade and thereafter  so that the level of claims activity against garlock will eventually decline to a level that can be paid from the cash flow expected from garlock s operations even if garlock exhausts its insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that epidemiological predictions about incidence of asbestos related disease will prove to be accurate  or that  even if they are  there will be a commensurate decline in the number of asbestos related claims filings 
in fact  such studies indicate that asbestos related diseases have been in decline for several years  yet asbestos related claims filings have increased 
considering the foregoing  as well as the experience of coltec s subsidiaries and other defendants in asbestos litigation  the likely sharing of judgments among multiple responsible defendants  recent bankruptcies of other defendants  and legislative efforts  and given the substantial amount of insurance coverage that garlock expects to be available from its solvent carriers  we believe that pending actions against garlock and anchor are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
we anticipate that asbestos related actions will continue to be filed against garlock 
because of the uncertainty as to the number and timing of potential future actions  as well as the amount that will have to be paid to settle or satisfy any such actions in the future  there can be no assurance that those future actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reform legislation 
the outlook for federal legislation to provide national asbestos litigation reform continues to be uncertain 
we are supportive generally of proposed legislation that would set up a national trust fund as the exclusive means for the recovery of asbestos related claims 
we are not certain as to what contributions we would be required to make to such a trust  although we anticipate that they would be substantial and that they would continue for a significant number of years 
while we are cautiously optimistic that proposed reform legislation ultimately will be adopted by the us congress  there is no assurance that the proposed bill or any other asbestos legislation will ultimately become law 
off balance sheet arrangements lease agreements we have several operating leases primarily for real estate  equipment and vehicles 
operating lease arrangements are generally utilized to secure the use of assets from time to time if the terms and conditions of the lease or the nature of the asset makes the lease arrangement more favorable than a purchase 
as of december   approximately million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these agreements 
see note  commitments and contingencies other commitments  in the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
debt and capital lease guarantees at december   we have outstanding contingent liabilities for guaranteed debt and lease payments of million related to previously divested businesses 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments at december   is as follows payments due by period in millions contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities total payments for other long term liabilities are estimates of amounts that will be paid for environmental and retained liabilities of previously owned businesses included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  these estimated payments are based on information currently known to us 
however  it is possible that these estimates will vary from actual results if new information becomes available in the future or if there are changes in the facts and circumstances related to these liabilities 
additional discussion regarding these liabilities is included earlier in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies environmental  other contingent liability matters  and in note in the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that there will be no required funding in  and have not determined whether we will make a discretionary contribution in outlook we continue to make progress in connection with our strategy to improve operating efficiency through our tcv initiative  to expand our product offerings and customer base  to strengthen the mix of our businesses  and to manage asbestos settlements by our subsidiaries 
our strong liquidity  cash flows and relatively low leverage ratio provide us with a sound financial base upon which we can build a stronger enpro 
we expect sales to increase in compared to  mainly due to increased engine shipments at fairbanks morse engine 
in addition  several of our key operations are looking forward to improved volumes as our markets have shown signs of improvement and increased demand in late this appears to correlate to the recent improvements in industrial economic indicators and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue 
we also are working on new products and have captured increased share in certain markets that we believe will result in improved results  especially if the economy improves 
higher sales volumes and the benefits of our tcv lean manufacturing initiative are expected to result in improved operating margins and increased profitability in we anticipate that cash flows in will benefit from lower net asbestos payments and improved operating income 
however  as previously described  the timing of asbestos related insurance receipts may be affected by the dispute with certain carriers 
investments that we will make in our new quincy compressor operation in china  our new ggb facility in slovakia and restructuring costs at certain of our us operations are expected to result in increased capital spending 
certain risk factors that may affect future results in addition to the risks stated elsewhere in this annual report  set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our shareholders 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
risks related to our spin off from goodrich corporation coltec s historical consolidated financial information may not be representative of our historical results as an independent company  therefore  it may not be reliable as an indicator of historical or future results 
the historical consolidated financial information of our wholly owned subsidiary coltec included in this report may not reflect what our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would have been on a historical basis had we operated the enpro business as an independent company during the periods presented or what our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be in the future 
this is because coltec s historical consolidated financial statements include allocations for services provided or procured by goodrich 
in addition  we have not made adjustments to coltec s historical consolidated financial information to reflect other changes that occurred in our cost structure  financing and operations as a result of the distribution 
finally  as a result of the distribution  goodrich  not enpro  owns coltec s aerospace business which is reflected in coltec s historical consolidated financial information as a discontinued operation 
therefore  coltec s historical consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent company 
we could incur significant indemnity obligations to goodrich for us federal income tax liability if acquisitions or issuances of enpro stock cause the distribution to be taxable 
the distribution was intended to be tax free to goodrich and its shareholders under section of the internal revenue code 
generally  goodrich may recognize a taxable gain on the distribution if there are one or more acquisitions or issuances of our capital stock representing or more of our then outstanding capital  measured by vote or value  and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution 
any shares of our stock acquired or issued within two years before or after the distribution will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption 
if the acquisition or issuance of our stock causes the distribution to be taxable to goodrich  we will be required to indemnify goodrich against any tax payable under the tax matters arrangements we entered into with goodrich as part of the distribution 
in addition  aside from the tax matters arrangements  under us federal income tax laws  we and goodrich would be severally liable for goodrich s federal income taxes from the distribution being taxable 
this means that even if we do not have to indemnify goodrich for any tax liabilities if the distribution fails to be tax free  we may still be liable for any part of  including the whole amount of  these liabilities and expenses if goodrich fails to pay them 
risks related to our business certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in asbestos litigation 
the historical business operations of two coltec subsidiaries  garlock sealing technologies llc and the anchor packing company  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets  which contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
although those subsidiaries actively manage their exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers through another coltec subsidiary  garrison litigation management group  ltd  several risks and uncertainties may result in potential liabilities to us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
those risks and uncertainties include the following the potential for a large volume of future asbestos claims to the extent such claims are not covered by insurance because insurance coverage is  or will be  depleted  the uncertainty of the per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims  the timing of payout of claims relative to recoveries of amounts covered by insurance from our subsidiaries insurance carriers and limitations imposed on the amount that may be recovered in any given year  the financial viability of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers  and our subsidiaries ability to collect on claims from them  an increase in litigation or other costs that are not covered by insurance  the unavailability of any insurance for claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after july   and bankruptcies of other defendants 
potential liability for asbestos claims may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and quality personnel 
to the extent our subsidiaries insurance is depleted or the payments required in any given year exceed the annual limitations on insurance recoveries from our subsidiaries carriers  our subsidiaries would be required to fund these obligations from available cash  even if such amounts are recoverable under these insurance policies in later years 
this could adversely affect our ability to use cash for other purposes  including growth of our business  and adversely affect our financial condition 
our business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and changes in general market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the markets in which we sell our products  particularly chemical companies  petroleum refineries and the automotive industry  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales  gross margins and net income 
economic downturns or other material weakness in demand in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our business 
additionally  customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories 
to remain competitive  we need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
additionally  some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products  we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the us and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets 
many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products 
a loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors  or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships  could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to discontinued operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period 
we have some contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations of our predecessors  including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters 
in some instances  we have indemnified others against those liabilities  and in other instances  we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities 
under federal and state environmental laws  coltec or one of its subsidiaries has been named as a potentially responsible party at sites at each of which the costs to it are expected to exceed thousand 
investigations have been completed or are near completion for of these sites and are in progress at the other two sites 
the majority of these sites relate to remediation projects at former operating facilities that have been sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater contamination 
we believe that any liability incurred for cleanup at these sites will be satisfied over a number of years  and  in some cases  the costs will be shared with other potentially responsible parties 
claims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations 
some of these claims could seek substantial monetary damages 
specifically  we may potentially be subject to the liabilities related to the firearms manufactured prior to by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to by central maloney  another former coltec operation 
coltec also has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of those operations 
our coltec subsidiary owns of the outstanding common stock of crucible through an irrevocable non voting trust 
a portion of the remaining of the shares of crucible are owned by crucible sponsored pension and profit sharing plans and the crucible employee stock ownership plan 
as crucible s employees retire  they are entitled to redeem those shares 
when shares are purchased by crucible  the shares are retired and coltec s percentage ownership in crucible increases 
if coltec s ownership of crucible s common stock were ever to exceed  coltec would be deemed to be a controlling person with respect to the crucible pension funds 
as such  coltec and enpro could become responsible for any shortfall if crucible s pension plans were terminated and the plans assets were not sufficient to cover the plans liabilities 
coltec also has ongoing obligations to pay retiree medical benefits for union employees at a crucible plant that was closed in the early s 
we have insurance  reserves and funds held in trust to address these liabilities 
however  if our insurance coverage is depleted  our reserves are not adequate or the funds held in trust are insufficient  environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of our products outside of the us our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks  including unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in foreign tax  legal and regulatory requirements  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing labor regulations  political and economic instability  and acts of hostility  terror or war 
any of these factors  individually or together  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities  which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations 
as we expand our international operations  we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents  distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to increase sales in these regions 
we also face numerous risks associated with establishing new facilities in slovakia and china  including unanticipated construction costs and delays in starting production 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
we believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know how  our business and prospects could be negatively impacted 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents  trademarks  service marks  domain names  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality  non compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
patents issued to third parties  whether before or after the issue date of our patents  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
questions as to whether our competitors products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors intellectual property rights may be disputed 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable  limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions 
our competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing upon our intellectual property rights 
without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property  our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired  which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue 
as a result  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
a relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant affect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers  competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as industry conditions and general financial  economic and political instability 
in particular  reports concerning the possibility of national asbestos litigation reform could cause a significant increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods  our stock price may fluctuate 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs 
small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include  but are not limited to demand for our products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  the timing of sales of our products  payments related to asbestos litigation or annual costs related to asbestos litigation that are not covered by insurance or that exceed the annual limits in place with our insurance  the timing of receipt of insurance proceeds  changes in the fair value of call options on goodrich common stock purchased by coltec to reduce the economic risk of the conversion feature of the tides  increases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products  announcements by competitors of new products  services or technological innovations  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  major changes in the level of economic activity in the us  canada  europe and other major regions in which we do business  costs related to possible future acquisitions of technologies or businesses  an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability claims  and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  particularly outside the united states 
various agreements and laws could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor 
the terms of some of our agreements relating to the distribution  particularly the tax matters arrangements with goodrich  anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and provisions of north carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
an acquisition or further issuance of our stock in connection with a change of control transaction or otherwise could cause the distribution and associated restructuring activities to be taxable to goodrich and coltec 
under the tax matters arrangements  we would be required to indemnify goodrich for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor 
in particular  the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  among other things  will require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors  divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms  if our board is expanded to nine members  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval

risks related to our capital structure our debt agreements impose limitations on our operations  which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investments and or pursue business opportunities 
the agreements relating to the tides and the coltec senior notes impose limitations on our operations

we may not have adequate cash or the ability to finance conversions of the tides 
until april   each tides is convertible at the option of the holder into a combination of of a share of goodrich common stock and of a share of enpro common stock 
should the holders of the tides exercise their right to convert the tides  coltec would be required to deliver shares of goodrich and enpro common stock to the holders as promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date and in connection therewith would be required to purchase shares of goodrich common stock on the open market  directly from goodrich or by exercising its call options on goodrich common stock discussed below 
coltec may not have sufficient cash on hand or the ability to finance these transactions in the time period required by the agreements relating to the tides 
failure to honor conversion rights would be a default under the tides agreements 
further  the value of goodrich and enpro common stock may increase to a level where coltec s cost to acquire shares in a conversion could exceed  with no maximum  the aggregate liquidation value of the tides of million 
coltec has purchased call options on shares of goodrich common stock with an exercise price of per share the conversion price  in an amount that would be required if all tides holders convert 
until they expire in march  the call options provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides could exceed their liquidation value 
while coltec has hedged its exposure to conversion costs in excess of the aggregate liquidation value of the tides  as described earlier  we cannot be certain that coltec will have the financial resources to redeem these securities or effectively hedge its exposure to potential conversion costs in excess of the aggregate liquidation value of the tides beyond the term of the call options 
enpro  goodrich  coltec and coltec capital trust have entered into an indemnification agreement with respect to the tides under which enpro  coltec and coltec capital trust will indemnify goodrich from any costs and liabilities that goodrich incurs as a result of its earlier guarantee of coltec and coltec capital trust s obligations under the tides
