item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem partners  and to the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
we customarily enter into development and distribution agreements with our oem customers 
these agreements can be terminated under a range of circumstances and often upon relatively short notice 
the circumstances under which an agreement can be terminated vary from agreement to agreement and there can be no assurance that our oem customers will continue to purchase products from us in the future  despite 
table of contents such agreements 
furthermore  our agreements with our oem customers generally do not commit such customers to make future purchases from us and they could decline to purchase products from us in the future and could purchase products from our competitors 
we recognize the importance of  and work hard to maintain  our relationships with our customers 
however  our relationships with our customers are affected by a number of factors including  among others competition from other suppliers  competition from internal development efforts by the customers themselves including the oems and changes in general economic  competitive or market conditions such as changes in demand for our or the oem s products  or fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain or build the relationships we have developed to date 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers and if we are not able to compete successfully then our business may be harmed 
in addition to development and sales relationships with our oem customers  in order to increase the distribution and presence of our controller solutions connected to both color and black and white copiers and wide format printing devices  we have developed strategic alliances with well known print for pay companies  including allegra print and imaging  alphagraphics  american speedy  kinko s  multicopy  inc  officemax  pip  sir speedy  speedy printer and zippy print and quik print 
strategic alliances allow us to enter into agreements to achieve a common goal with companies that have complementary strengths 
we also have a continuing relationship pursuant to a license agreement with adobe and license postscript software from adobe for use in many of our controller solutions 
this relationship is important because each of our controller solutions requires page description language software such as that provided by adobe in order to operate 
adobe s postscript software is widely used to manage the geometry  shape and typography of hard copy documents and adobe is a leader in providing page description software 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products 
distribution and marketing our primary distribution method for our controller solutions is to sell them to our oems 
our oems in turn sell these products to oem affiliated and independent distributors dealers resellers and end users for use with the oems copiers or printers as part of an integrated printing system 
for fiery embedded controller solutions  our primary distribution method has been to sell the products to the oems that embed the products into their copiers and printers 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem partners and to the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
our primary distribution method for our edox  docstream and micropress servers  and our efi proofing solutions and efi workflow software products is to sell them directly to our authorized distributors dealers resellers who in turn sell the solutions to end users either in a stand alone form or bundled with other solutions they offer 
primary partners with whom we have established distribution agreements include kodak polychrome graphics  enovation  heidelberg  screen usa  pitman  prestek and others 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully distribute our products through these channels 
our print management information solutions are primarily sold directly to the end user by efi s own sales force 
any interruption of the distribution methods could negatively impact us in the future 
we promote all of our products through public relations  direct mail  advertising  promotional material  trade shows and ongoing customer communication programs 
research and development research and development costs for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   of our  full time employees were involved in 
table of contents research and development 
we believe that development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success and management intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development 
we expect to make significant expenditures to support our research and development programs for the foreseeable future 
we are developing products to support additional color and black and white printing devices including desktop printers  high end color copiers  digital black and white copiers and multi function devices 
this ongoing development work includes a multiprocessor architecture for high end systems and lower cost designs for desktop color laser printers 
we are also developing new software applications designed to maximize workflow efficiencies and to meet the needs of the graphics arts and commercial print professional  including proofing solutions and print management information systems solutions 
we also expect to continue to enhance functionality of our other product lines  including our enterprise solutions 
see growth and expansion strategies proliferate and expand product lines 
substantial additional work and expense will be required to complete and bring to market each of the products currently being developed by us see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed 
manufacturing we utilize subcontractors to manufacture our products 
these subcontractors work closely with us to promote low costs and high quality in the manufacture of our products 
subcontractors purchase components needed for our products from third parties 
we are completely dependent on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products sold by us and although we supervise our subcontractors  there can be no assurance that such subcontractors will continue to perform for us as well as they have in the past 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors  with whom we do not have long term contracts  to manufacture and deliver products to our customers and the loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business 
a significant number of the components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components 
we depend largely on the following sole and limited source suppliers for our components and manufacturing services supplier components intel central processing units  or cpus  chip sets toshiba asics lsi asics texas instruments digital signal processors  or dsps sanmina sci contract manufacturing we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers of components and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers were unwilling or unable to supply us with the components for which we rely on them  we may be unable to continue manufacturing our products utilizing such components 
the absence of agreements with our suppliers also subjects us to fluctuations in pricing  a factor we believe is partially offset by the fact that our suppliers benefit from selling as many components to us as possible  which is driven in part by competitive pricing 
many of our components are similar to those used in personal computers  and the demand and price fluctuations of personal computer components could affect our component costs 
because the purchase of key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we may be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet end user demand  or we may hold excess quantities of inventory 
we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and of components with prices that fluctuate significantly 

table of contents human resources as of december   we employed  full time individuals 
of the  total employees  approximately were in sales and marketing  were in management and administration  were in manufacturing and were in research and development 
of the total number of employees  we had approximately  employees located in us and canadian offices and employees located in international offices including employees based in the united kingdom  the netherlands  germany  japan  france  italy  spain  australia  korea  singapore  brazil  mexico  sweden  india  china and hong kong 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
however  there can be no assurance that collective bargaining  work stoppage or other employment related issues will not arise 
competition competition in our markets is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
to maintain and improve our competitive position  we must continue to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers 
the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our controller solutions include  among others  customer service and support  product reputation  quality  performance  price and product features such as functionality  scalability  ability to interface with oem products and ease of use 
we believe we have generally competed effectively in the past against product offerings of our competitors on the basis of such factors 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to compete effectively in the future based on these or any other competitive factors 
we currently have two main product categories that support color and black and white printing i stand alone print servers which are connected to digital copiers and other peripheral devices and ii embedded and design licensed solutions which are used in digital copiers and desktop laser printers 
our primary competitor for the stand alone color servers is creo although creo only sells to a single oem  xerox  while efi serves many industry leaders 
our oem customers themselves  as well as peerless and zoran corporation  are the principal competitors for the embedded and design licensed color solutions 
our digital black and white solutions face competition from peerless and our oem customers 
additionally  our oem customers and other copier and printer manufacturers offer internally developed server products or incorporate internally developed embedded solutions or server features into their copiers and printers  thereby eliminating the need for our products 
our market position vis a vis internally developed controllers is small 
we are  however  the largest third party controller vendor 
we believe that our advantages include our continuously advancing technology  time to market  brand recognition  end user loyalty  sizable installed base  number of products supported  price and market knowledge 
a significant disadvantage is our lack of control of the distribution channels 
we do  however  provide a variety of features as well as a unique look and feel to our oems as required to differentiate their products from those of their competitors 
our professional printing applications category  which includes our workflow  proofing  print management information software and web submission tools  faces competition from software application vendors that specifically target the printing industry  which are typically small  privately owned companies and from larger vendors  such as heidelberg and sap  who currently offer or are seeking to develop printer focused enterprise resource planning products 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include adoption by significant number of print buyers and printers  product quality and performance  customer service  core technology  product features  price and the value of services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to advance our technology and products or to compete effectively against other companies product offerings and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  
table of contents all of which afford only limited protection 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications and various foreign counterpart patents and applications 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from these pending applications or from any future applications or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
our issued us patents expire between january  and march  our failure to obtain or maintain patent protection may make it easier for our competitors to offer equivalent or superior technology 
in addition  third parties may independently develop similar technology without misappropriation of our trade secrets or breach of other proprietary rights 
any failure by us to take all necessary steps to protect our trade secrets or other intellectual property rights and failure to enforce these rights may have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in our markets 
we have registered certain trademarks  which include  among others  our efi  efi and design  electronics for imaging stylized  fiery  fiery and design  fiery driven  fiery driven and design  fiery spark and design  colorcal  colorwise  command workstation  bestcolor  edox  micropress  mousitometer  printcafe  printersite  printme  splash 
spot on and rip while print trademarks and have applied for registration of certain additional trademarks  in the united states and or in foreign jurisdictions 
we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
any failure by us to properly register or maintain our trademarks or to otherwise take all necessary steps to protect our trademarks may diminish the value associated with our trademarks 
our products include software sold pursuant to shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  including several in which we operate or sell our products  do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time  litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of management s attention and other resources 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all assumptions  anticipations  expectations and forecasts contained herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
for a discussion of the factors that could impact our results  readers are referred to the section below entitled factors that could adversely affect performance 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which are the basis of the following discussion and analysis requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition and contingencies 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are believed to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and other allowances  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which primarily includes servers  controllers  design licensed solutions  software and royalties and ii services and 
table of contents support revenue which includes consulting and development fees 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue from the sale of servers  controllers and design licensed solutions when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to the customer s common carrier 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing and post contract customer support 
software revenue is allocated to the license and support elements using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe or  in the absence of vsoe  the residual method 
vsoe is determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of vsoe of a delivered element  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognised when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognised ratably over the term of the support contract typically one to two years  assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we recognize revenue for consulting and development services over the contract term 
our consulting and development fees are based on time and materials and we recognize revenue as these services are performed 
if these services are related to product development  we recognize the fee using milestones as defined in the contract 
we recognize revenue from oem maintenance contracts ratably over the contract term 
allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and other allowances and reserves 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was million  net of reserves of million as of december  we have from time to time set up allowances or reserves for uncertainties related to revenues  for potential unfavorable litigation outcomes and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with custom 
table of contents ers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or reserves on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
we provide us taxes on earnings of our non us subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are not permanently reinvested 
significant management judgement is needed in estimating the extent to which earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
as of december   the non us earnings considered permanently reinvested were not considered material 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
we completed our annual review in the third quarter of  based upon june  balances  with no impairment of goodwill indicated as a result of the review 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and reclassified approximately million of other net intangible assets and related deferred taxes to goodwill upon adoption of sfas in no adjustments to the lives of the other intangible assets were made during determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  of our total assets and of our total liabilities as of december  
table of contents in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of income or as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in stockholders equity 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of income 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our consolidated statement of income 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of income 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiary  efi kk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency and one of our german subsidiaries  best gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency

years ended december  revenue servers embedded products professional printing applications miscellaneous total revenue years ended december  volume servers embedded products professional printing applications miscellaneous total volume revenue was million in  compared to million in and million in  which resulted in a increase in versus and a decrease of in compared to revenue from our acquisitions accounted for million of the million increase in revenues in from an increase in the average selling price of our print servers and the introduction of new software products were the primary factors for the same store increase in revenue during the major factor contributing to the overall lower revenue in over was a decline in volume shipped  a reflection of the decline in general economic conditions 
shipments of our stand alone servers  both color and black and white  decreased in when compared to  while shipments of our embedded products increased during the same comparative period 
throughout all categories  the number of units shipped declined in as compared to in in the embedded products category there was a change in the product mix toward the higher end products evidenced by a higher average selling price  while in all of the other categories  the product mix resulted in a lower average selling price  which combined with lower shipping volumes  accounted for the decrease in revenue 
we believe that price reductions for all of our products may affect revenues in the future 
we have made and may in the future make price reductions for our products in order to drive demand and remain competitive 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
if we are not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  our results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents shipments by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows change years ended december  over over in thousands north america europe japan rest of world total new server products  as well as the revenues from our acquisitions  fueled the increase in revenue in both north america and europe when comparing to the increase in japan in is due to the higher number of design licensed solutions as the design licensed product is shipped to japan for manufacturing and is then redistributed around the world 
the decrease in revenue between and stems from decreased sales of all products in all regions except the rest of world 
the rest of world region includes the asia pacific market  excluding japan  where penetration of new markets kept revenues at the same level during and as shipments to some of our oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations which in turn sell through to other locations  we believe that non us sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
we expect that non us sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
substantially all of the revenue for the last three years was attributable to sales of products through our oem channels with such customers as canon  epson  fuji xerox  ibm  hewlett packard  kodak danka business systems  konicaminolta  oc  ricoh  sharp  toshiba  xerox and others 
we relied on three oem customers  canon  konicaminolta and xerox  in aggregate for of our revenue for we relied on three oem customers  canon  minolta and xerox  in aggregate for of our revenue for we relied on four oem customers  canon  minolta  ricoh and xerox  in aggregate for of our revenue for in the event that any of these oem relationships are scaled back or discontinued  we may experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  no assurance can be given that our relationships with these oem customers will continue 
we continue to work on the development of products utilizing the fiery  splash micropress and edox architecture and other products and intend to continue to introduce new generations of server and controller products and other new product lines with current and new oem s in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of new  current or future products will be successful 
gross margins our gross margin was  and for  and respectively 
the basis point increase in gross margin from to from to was due to the introduction of additional digital printing engines for the commercial print markets  the conversion of more new office products to the design licensed model and increased software sales  including the products from our acquisitions 
the basis point increase in gross margin from to resulted principally from an increase in software sales compared to the prior year  the migration of embedded controller sales to design license sales for certain of our products and the utilization of fewer contract manufacturers and favorable component pricing 
we cannot predict the impact of each of these  or other factors  on future gross margin results 
our print servers as well as embedded desktop controllers are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
we do purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which we license from adobe systems  inc 
table of contents in general  we believe that the current gross margin levels are sustainable 
however gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on our current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of our product transitions and new products  competition and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  we anticipate gross margins may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we are pressured to reduce prices  gross margins for our products could be lower 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and decreased by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue amounted to  and for  and  respectively 
operating expenses in absolute dollars increased million before the amortization of identifiable intangibles and other acquisition related charges in compared to there was a decrease of million before the amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles and other acquisition related charges in compared to the acquisition of three companies in accounted for million of the increase between and before the amortization of identifiable intangibles and other acquisition related charges 
the remaining million can be attributed to increased payroll costs from the first salary increase in two years  given during the first quarter of  offset with reductions in facility costs 
beginning in and continuing through management focused on reducing expenses during a difficult economic period 
careful management of discretionary expenditures and selective workforce reductions were used to achieve the reduced expenditures 
operating expenses for included approximately million for the amortization of acquired intangibles and million for the write off of acquired in process research and development costs 
in the amortization of acquired intangibles was million 
in  before the adoption of sfas  operating expenses included million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
we anticipate that operating expenses may increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as investments are made in new business areas and acquired companies are integrated 
the components of operating expenses are detailed below 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel related and facility expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting  depreciation and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in of the million or increase in absolute dollars from to  approximately million is attributable to the increased head count from the acquisition of three companies in the remaining million increase came from increased payroll costs 
the decrease in from in research and development expenses stemmed from the company wide effort to control spending  including payroll related costs 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success and intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and product development efforts 
we expect that our research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of revenue 
as part of our cost containment practices  we now review all projects on a periodic basis for estimated return on investment 
those projects that do not meet certain criteria are changed or halted 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel related expenses  costs for trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  japan and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or 
table of contents of revenue in and million or of revenue in our acquisitions in led to increased head count in the sales and marketing group and accounted for million in sales and marketing expenses in the remaining million increase in sales and marketing expenses in came from salary increases and increased participation in trade shows  offset by decreased facility costs 
the million decrease in absolute dollars in from was attributable to the company wide effort to control spending by participation in fewer trade shows  reduced personnel related and facility expenses and overall cost containment 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as we continue to actively promote our products and launch new products 
this expected increase might not proportionally increase with increases in volume as our sales continue to gravitate toward products such as software and design licensed solutions which require different marketing approaches than our traditional server products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  professional fees and other costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the relatively flat general and administrative expenses between and are the result of decreased facility costs offset with an increase in payroll costs and the addition of million in general and administrative expenses related to our acquisitions 
while general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue in over  in absolute dollars the expenses decreased by million during the decrease in was a result of the company wide effort to control spending through decreased consulting costs  reduced facility expenses and reduced personnel related expense 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses could increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue in order to support our efforts to grow our business in future periods 
amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles and other acquisition related charges amortization of identifiable intangibles  was million or of revenue in  while the acquisition related charge for the write off of in process research and development was million or of revenue for amortization of identifiable intangibles was million or of revenue in and million or in amortization of goodwill  discontinued for fiscal years beginning after march  under sfas was million in upon adoption of the standard in january  we ceased amortizing goodwill and began periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
no impairment of goodwill was identified upon completion of the annual impairment test performed upon the june  balances 
interest and other income  net interest income interest income of million in decreased by from million in interest income of million in decreased by from million in the decrease in from and in from is due to a lower return on investments as a result of market interest rates that have fallen in the last two years 
the decline in interest was offset in part by an increase in the investment balance from additional cash generated from operations and from the proceeds of our million convertible debenture offering in june  net of million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and million of debt issuance costs 
interest expense interest expense and debt issuance costs related to the convertible debentures was million for the year ended december  interest expense in and related to the bonds associated with the

a portion of those bonds were paid off during  thereby reducing the interest expense in litigation settlement income charges  net in we received litigation settlement income of million  net of related legal expenses  from the settlement of litigation protecting our intellectual property 
litigation settlement expenses in other income in consist of the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit for million  including legal fees and other related costs 
while there has been no change in our view that the lawsuit had no merit  we determined that settlement of the lawsuit was in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders 
loss on equity investment in june we exercised an option granted by printcafe to purchase approximately million shares of printcafe stock  representing approximately a ownership in printcafe  which we accounted for as an available for sale equity security 
in october  we acquired the remaining interest in printcafe 
we were required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap to report the investment in printcafe on an equity basis from the time of the option exercise through the date that we acquired of the outstanding shares of printcafe 
a million loss was recorded as a result of the change to equity method of accounting 
other income expense  net realized gains on short term investments accounted for million of the million of other income  net in in  the realized gains on short term investments were million while the losses on foreign currency translations were million 
the remaining million loss in was related to losses from our investment in a venture capital fund 
in  the million in other income was comprised primarily of million of realized gains on short term investments net of million of foreign currency translation 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in and in in each of these years  we benefited from tax exempt interest income and the utilization of the research and development credits 
we also benefited from foreign sales in our rate increased in as a result of both the in process research and development write offs related to the printcafe and t r systems acquisitions which are not deductible for tax purposes and the loss on our pro rata share of printcafe s losses prior to the completion of the acquisition 
our effective tax rate was also adversely impacted both by taxes provided on non us earnings in and as well as charges associated with the acquisition of splash in excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges in and  our effective tax rate would have been  and in  and  respectively 
subsequent events on february  we acquired ads communications  inc ads for approximately million in cash 
ads  a privately held  arizona based company  is a leading provider of service automation software for the office equipment industry 
the automated equipment maintenance systems from ads offer excellent synergies with our product portfolio for the office equipment channel  particularly in the area of intelligent device management

fasb interpretation no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is sufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding the nature  purpose  size and activities of the vie and the enterprise s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the vie 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin reissued interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based upon the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january  but prior to january  may be accounted for on the basis of the original interpretation s provisions 
non special purpose entities created prior to february  should be accounted for under the reissued interpretations provisions no later than december  effective july   we have applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in fin for vies acquired before january  we have evaluated the synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin we determined the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  as we are not the primary beneficiary under fin we are not required to consolidate the vies in the financial statements 
we have not entered into any arrangement with vies created after january  sab on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material effect on our financial condition or result of operations

our accounts receivable balances increased significantly due to the acquisition of 
table of contents printcafe and t r systems in late and the increase in our days sales outstanding dso related to the longer collection cycle experienced by printcafe and t r systems 
inventories have increased due to materials purchased to complete acquired work in process inventory and to take advantage of optimal component pricing in the marketplace 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to principally as a result of a decrease in net income and depreciation expense and decreases in the cash generated by changes in the elements of working capital  primarily in inventories  accounts receivable from customers and subcontract manufacturers  income taxes payable and accounts payable

other commitments our inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems  processors and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially fixed assets would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventory we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related reserve 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the accrued liability 

table of contents legal proceedings in addition to the matters discussed under item  legal proceedings  we are involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

at the end of each of the leases we are required to either renew the lease  or purchase the building 
one of our lease agreements expires in july  at which point we intend to renew the lease 
for purposes of this disclosure we have not included any rental payments related to this lease beyond july as such amounts have yet to be determined 
we could be required to purchase one of the corporate facility buildings if we do not renew the lease upon expiration in july as we intend to renew the lease we have not included the purchase amount for the facility under the capital purchase obligations 
see off balance sheet financing below 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on efi and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations

in december we entered into a second agreement 
table of contents lease and together with the lease  the leases to lease an additional  square foot building on our foster city property 
these leases were implemented to provide the lowest possible total cost of occupancy for our corporate headquarters 
both leases have an initial term of seven years  with options to renew subject to certain conditions 
we may  at our option  purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the respective lessor to construct the facilities approximately million for the lease and approximately million for the lease 
we have guaranteed to the lessors a residual value associated with the buildings equal to approximately of the their funding 
we may be liable to the lessor for the amount of the residual guarantee if we either fail to renew the lease or do not purchase or locate a purchaser for the leased facilities at the end of the lease term 
we must meet certain financial covenant requirements related to cash to debt  fixed charge coverage ratio  leverage ratio and consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the lease agreements 
if we maintain pledged collateral  then a limited subset of these covenants must be met 
the tangible net worth financial covenant requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there are other covenants regarding mergers  liens and judgements and lines of business 
we are in compliance with all of the covenants  either directly  or through the existence of the pledged collateral 
the pledged collateral under the lease million at december  has been classified as restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we are liable to the lessor for the total amount financed if we default on our covenants approximately million for the lease and approximately million for the lease 
the company could be required to purchase the building covered by the lease if it defaulted on any indebtedness in excess of million  it failed to appeal a judgment in excess of million  or a creditor has commenced enforcement proceedings on an order for payment of money in excess of million

in january the fasb issued fin as noted under recent accounting pronouncements  the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the variable interest entity primary beneficiary 
effective july   we have applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in fin for vies acquired before january  we have evaluated the synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin we determined the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  as we are not the primary beneficiary under fin we are not required to consolidate the vies in the financial statements 
we have not entered into any arrangement with vies created after january  under both leases we have first loss guarantees to the lessors  which make us liable for declines in the value of these buildings up to approximately of the cost of the construction of the buildings 
the first loss guarantee requires payment upon the end of the lease 
we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees for both of the facilities under synthetic lease arrangements and have determined there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  we will continue to assess the real estate market conditions to evaluate whether we need to record any reserves under our first loss guarantee obligations

factors that could adversely affect performance we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem partners and the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated by sales of our printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of oems 
for example  canon  xerox and konicaminolta each contributed over of our revenues and together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
during  these same three partners each contributed over of our revenues and together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
because our printer and copier related products remain a significant portion of our business and there are a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem partners for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
accordingly  if we lose or experience reduced sales to an important oem customer  we will have difficulty replacing the revenue traditionally generated from such customer with sales to new or existing oem customers and our revenues will likely decline significantly 
we do not typically have long term purchase contracts with our customers and our customers have in the past and could at any time in the future  reduce or cease purchasing products from us  harming our operating results and business 
with the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations  we typically do not have long term volume purchase contracts with our customers  including canon  xerox and konicaminolta and they are not obligated 
table of contents to purchase products from us 
accordingly  our customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether 
in the past  some of our oem customers have elected to develop products on their own  rather than purchase our products and we expect that customers will continue to make such elections in the future 
in addition  since our oem customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell  any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers and any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general  is likely to harm our results of operations 
for example  several of our customers have in the past experienced serious financial difficulties which led to a decline in sales of our products to these customers 
if any significant customers should face such difficulties in the future  our operating results could be harmed through  among other things  decreased sales volumes and write offs of accounts receivables and inventory related to products we have manufactured for these customers products 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance based on projected sales levels and margins  sales forecasts from our oem customers and product development programs 
a substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less and our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty 
accordingly  if sales to our oem customers are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall in revenues on operating results may be increased by our inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for this shortfall 
we rely on our oem customers to develop and sell products incorporating our technologies and if they fail to successfully develop and sell these products  or curtail or cease the use of our technologies in their products  our business will be harmed 
we rely upon our oem customers to develop new products  applications and product enhancements utilizing our technology in a timely and cost effective manner 
our continued success depends upon the ability of these oem customers to utilize our technologies while meeting changing end user customer needs and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
however  we cannot assure you that our oem customers will effectively meet these requirements 
these oem customers  who are not within our control  are generally not obligated to purchase products from us and we cannot assure you that they will continue to carry our products 
for example  our oem customers have incorporated into their products the technologies of other companies in addition to  or instead of our technologies and will likely continue to do so in the future 
if our oem customers do not effectively market products containing our technologies  our sales revenue will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our oem customers work closely with us to develop products that are specific to each oem customer s copiers and printers 
many of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development  quality testing  marketing and other tasks with our oem customers 
we cannot control our oem customers development efforts and coordinating with our oem customers may cause delays in our own product development efforts that are outside of our control 
in addition  our sales revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our oem customers product needs for their specific copiers and printers  as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products 
ongoing economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends significantly on the overall demand for information technology products such as ours that enable printing of digital data 
delays or reductions in information technology spending  such as occurred during  has and could continue to cause a decline in demand for our products and services and consequently harm our business  operating results  financial condition  prospects and stock price 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we expect our stock price to vary with our operating results and  consequently  fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
factors that have caused our operating results to fluctuate in the past and may cause future fluctuations include varying demand for our products  due to seasonality  oem customer product development and marketing efforts  oem customer financial and operational condition and general economic conditions  success and timing of new product introductions by us and our oem customers and the performance of our products generally  volatility in foreign exchange rates  changes in interest rates and availability of bank or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers  price reductions by us and our competitors  which may be exacerbated by competitive pressures caused by economic conditions generally  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders or projects  availability of key components  including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers  the performance of third party manufacturers and the status of our relationships with our key suppliers  potential excess or shortage of employees and location of research and development centers  changes in our product mix such as shifts from higher revenue products to lower revenue products dependant on higher sales volumes  costs associated with complying with any applicable governmental regulations  including substantial costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  specifically the section compliance  acquisitions and integration of new businesses  changes in our business model related to the migration of embedded products to a design licensed model  costs related to the entry into new markets  such as commercial printing and office equipment service automation  general economic conditions  and other risks described herein 
we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be harmed 
our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes 
we compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products and technologies  including our oem customers themselves 
although we attempt to develop and support innovative products that end customers demand  products or technologies developed by competing suppliers  including our own oem customers  could render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
while many of our oem customers incorporate our technologies into their end products on an exclusive basis  we do not have any formal agreements that prevent these oem customers from offering alternative products that do not incorporate our technologies 
if an oem customer offers products from alternative suppliers our market share could decrease  which would likely reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  many oems in the printer and copier industry  including most of our oem customers  internally develop and sell products that compete directly with our current products 
these oems have significant investments in their existing solutions and have substantial resources that may enable them to 
table of contents develop or improve  more quickly than us  technologies similar to ours that are compatible with their own products 
our oem customers have in the past marketed and likely will continue in the future to market  their own internal technologies and solutions in addition to ours  even when their technologies and solutions are less advanced  have lower performance or cost more than our products 
given the significant financial  marketing and other resources of our larger oem customers and other significant oems in the imaging industry who are not our customers  we may not be able to successfully compete against similar products developed internally by these oems  particularly in the black and white and embedded color product markets where price competition is most intense and profit margins are low 
if we cannot compete successfully against the oems internally developed products  we will lose sales and market share in those areas where the oems choose to compete and our business may be harmed 
demand for technology  in general  and for products containing our technology that enable black and white and color printing of digital data has decreased over the past three years and could continue to decrease  adversely affecting our sales revenue 
our products are primarily targeted at enabling the printing of black and white and color digital data 
demand for networked printers and copiers containing our technology decreased from through due to the global economic downturn 
if demand for digital printing products and services containing our technology were to continue to decline  or if the demand for our oem customers specific printers or copiers for which our products are designed were to continue to decline  our sales revenue would likely decrease 
our products are combined with products  such as digital printers and copiers  that are large capital expenditures as well as discretionary purchase items for the end customer 
in difficult economic times such as we have recently experienced  spending on information technology typically decreases 
as the products in which our products are incorporated are of a more discretionary nature than many other technology products  we may be more adversely impacted by deteriorating general economic conditions than other technology firms outside of our market 
the decrease in demand for our products has harmed and could  in the future  continue to harm our results of operations and we do not know whether demand for our products or our customers products will increase or improve from current levels 
if we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees  we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion 
we depend upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills 
we are headquartered in the silicon valley where competition has historically been intense among companies to hire engineering and technical professionals 
in times of professional labor imbalances  it may be difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people 
there are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the silicon valley that may try to hire our employees 
the movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees 
if we do not offer competitive compensation  we may not be able to recruit or retain employees 
we offer a broad based equity compensation plan based on granting options from stockholder approved plans in order to be competitive in the labor market 
if stockholders do not approve additional shares for these plans for future grants  it may be difficult for us to hire and retain skilled employees 
if we cannot successfully hire and retain employees  we may not be able to develop products or to meet demand for our products in a timely fashion and our results of operations may be harmed 
recent and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with our company 
several agencies and entities are considering and the fasb has announced that it will propose  changes to us gaap that  if implemented  would require us to 
table of contents record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants 
this pending regulation would negatively impact our earnings 
for example  recording a charge for employee stock options under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation would have reduced net income by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed 
our operating results depend to a significant extent on our continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new products and technologies by us 
our success depends not only on our ability to predict future requirements  but also to successfully develop and introduce new products that address end customer needs or add additional functionality that end customers will demand 
any delays in the launch or availability of new products we are planning could harm our financial results 
during transitions from existing products to new products  customers may delay or cancel orders for existing products 
our results of operations may be harmed if we cannot successfully manage product transitions or provide adequate availability of products after they have been introduced 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance performance and functionality of our products  including product lines different than our fiery  splash  micropress and edox servers and embedded controllers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and introduce new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
also  when we decide to develop new products  our research and development expenses generally increase in the short term without a corresponding increase in revenue  which can harm our operating results 
finally  we cannot assure you that products and technologies developed by our own customers and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we enter new markets or distribution channels this could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenue 
we continue to explore opportunities to develop product lines different from our current servers and embedded controllers  such as the best and printcafe software  sendme  printme  efi workflow software solutions and efi web submission tools  among others 
we expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services  which will increase our operating expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services or if we will generate sufficient revenues from these activities to offset the additional operating expenses we incur 
in addition  even if we are able to introduce new products or services  the lack of marketplace acceptability of these new products or services may adversely impact our operating results 
we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products 
most of our current products include software that we must license from adobe 
specifically  we are required to obtain separate licenses from adobe for the right to use adobe postscript software in each type of copier or printer used with a fiery server or controller 
although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript software when required  adobe is not required to and we cannot be certain that adobe will  grant future licenses to adobe postscript software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  in order to obtain licenses from adobe  adobe requires that we obtain from them quality assurance approvals for our products that use adobe software 
although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurances from adobe  we cannot be certain adobe will grant us such approvals in the future 
if 
table of contents adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe licenses are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise materially impaired  we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate adobe postscript software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
in some products we have introduced substitute software developed internally that does not require any license from adobe 
the costs to continue to develop software internally could increase our research and development expenditures and we may not be able to recapture those costs through increased sales 
while we plan on expanding the number of products using internally developed software  there can be no assurance that these products will be accepted in the market 
we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products and the loss of any of these suppliers could adversely affect our business 
certain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components 
we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our component suppliers and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis 
because the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we have been in the past and may in the future be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet end user demand 
similarly  as has occurred in the past  in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize  we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete 
in order to meet projected demand  we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of inventory obsolescence  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  the market prices and availability of certain components  particularly memory and intel designed components  which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products  have fluctuated significantly in the past 
such fluctuations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including a reduction in gross margins 
we are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors  with whom we do not have long term contracts  to manufacture and deliver products to our customers and the loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business 
we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products and we do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors 
we rely on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products to be sold to our customers and while we closely monitor our subcontractors performance we cannot make assurances that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner 
the weakened economy has led to the dissolution  bankruptcies and consolidations of some of the subcontractors who are able to manufacture our products  decreasing the available number of subcontractors 
if the available number of subcontractors continues to decrease  it is possible that we will not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner or at all  particularly if demand for our products increases  or if we lose one or more of our current subcontractors 
fewer subcontractors may also reduce our negotiating leverage regarding product costs 
difficulties experienced by our subcontractors  including financial problems and the inability to make or ship our products or fix quality assurance problems  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we decide to change subcontractors  we could experience delays in setting up new subcontractors which would result in delays in delivery of our products and potentially the cancellation of orders for our products 
a high concentration of our products is manufactured at a single subcontractor location  sanmina sci in colorado 
should sanmina sci experience any inability to manufacture or deliver product from this location our business  financial condition and operations could be harmed 
since we do not maintain long term agreements with our subcontractors  any of our subcontractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit such subcontractors from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability of such subcontractor from filling our orders in a timely manner 
in such event  we may not be able to find suitable replacement subcontractors and our business  financial condition and operations would likely be harmed 

table of contents seasonal purchasing patterns of our oem customers have historically caused lower fourth and first quarter revenue  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
our results of operations have typically followed a seasonal pattern reflecting the buying patterns of our large oem customers 
in the fiscal quarter completed december  and in past fiscal fourth quarters the quarter ending december our results have been adversely affected because some or all of our oem customers decrease  or otherwise delay  fourth quarter orders 
over the past several years our oem customers have lowered channel inventories throughout the year  causing this effect to shift more from the fourth quarter into the first quarter  when our oem customers typically have lower sales of their own products 
in addition  the first fiscal quarter traditionally has been a weaker quarter because our oem customers focus on training their sales forces and have reduced sales to their customers 
the primary reasons for these seasonal patterns are our oem customers have historically sought to minimize year end inventory investment including the reduction in demand following introductory channel fill purchases  the timing of new product releases and training by our oem customers in the first and fourth quarters  and certain of our oem customers typically achieve their yearly sales targets before year end and consequently delay further purchases into the next fiscal year we do not know when our customers reach these sales targets as they generally do not disclose them to us 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict our future performance 
we anticipate that future operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the continuation or changes in this seasonal demand pattern 
we may make acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources 
as part of this effort  we have in the past made and will likely continue to make  acquisitions of other companies or other companies assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  alternatively  acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves  difficulties in integration of operations  employees  technologies  or products and the related diversion of management time and effort to accomplish successful integration  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions  possible write downs of impaired assets  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  possible expense overruns  an adverse reaction by customers  suppliers or partners of the acquired company or efi  the risk of changes in ratings by stock analysts  potential litigation surrounding transactions  
table of contents the inability to protect or secure technology rights  and an increase in operating costs 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and we cannot make assurances that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business  operating results  financial condition  or stock price 
we face risks from our international operations and from currency fluctuations 
approximately and of our revenue from the sale of products for the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively  came from sales outside north america  primarily to europe and japan 
we expect that sales outside north america will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations 
these risks include the regulatory requirements of foreign governments which may apply to our products  as well as requirements for export licenses which may be required for the export of certain technologies 
the necessary export licenses may be delayed or difficult to obtain  which could cause a delay in our international sales and hurt our product revenue 
other risks include trade protection measures  natural disasters and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region 
given the significance of our non us sales to our total product revenue  we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies and numerous southeast asian currencies 
we typically invoice our customers in us dollars and this may result in our products becoming more expensive in the local currency of our customers  thereby reducing our ability to sell our products 
when we do invoice our customers in local currencies  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the us dollar 
in january  we acquired best gmbh  whose sales are principally denominated in the euro 
sales from this subsidiary increase our exposure to currency fluctuations 
in addition  we have a substantial number of international employees which creates material operating costs denominated in foreign currencies 
we have attempted to limit or hedge these exposures through operational strategies where we consider it appropriate 
our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
we have patent applications pending in the united states and in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from these pending applications or from any future applications  or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot be certain that any patents that may be issued to us  or which we license from third parties  or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents  licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information 
litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation 
third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights 
such claims have in the past resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation and 
table of contents could do so in the future 
such claims and any related litigation  whether or not we are successful in the litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot assure you that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our products may contain defects which are not discovered until after shipping 
our products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others 
our products may contain undetected errors and we have in the past discovered software and hardware errors in certain of our products after their introduction 
there can be no assurance that errors would not be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipments  or that any such errors would not result in a loss or delay in market acceptance and thus harm our reputation and revenues 
in addition  errors in our products including errors in licensed third party software detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and our incurring additional expense  which could harm our operating results 
the location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes  floods or other natural disasters and public health risks 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development facilities and manufacturing operations  are located in the san francisco bay area  an area known for seismic activity 
this area has also experienced flooding in the past 
in addition  many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas including the san francisco bay area  taiwan and japan and are therefore subject to risk from natural disasters 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or a flood  could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have employees  suppliers and customers located worldwide 
we face the risk that our employees  suppliers  or customers  either through travel or contact with other individuals  could become exposed to contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
in addition  governments in those regions have from time to time imposed quarantines and taken other actions in response to contagious diseases that could affect our operations 
if a significant number of employees  suppliers  or customers were unable to fulfill their obligations  due to contagious diseases  actions taken in response to contagious diseases  or other reasons  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
the value of our investment portfolio will decrease if interest rates increase 
we have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause our investment portfolio to decrease in value 
our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the twelve month period ended december   the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  
table of contents changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  changes in general economic conditions  terrorist attacks and the effects of military engagements  changes in the rating of our debentures or other securities  and changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility any repurchases pursuant to the stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
there can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price 
the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock 
additionally  we are permitted and could discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in june  we issued million in convertible senior debentures due in during the period the debentures are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the debentures of approximately million per year in interest payments  payable semi annually 
in addition  beginning june   we could be required to pay contingent interest of if during any six month period from june to november and december to may  the average market price of the debentures for the five trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
our debt service obligations related to the debentures include the following redemption and repurchase terms that could also affect our cash position on or after june   we may redeem the debentures for cash at any time as a whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debenture to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  on june  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase in cash  and a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any and from our existing cash and investments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we may add lines of credit and obtain other long term debt and mortgage financing to finance capital expenditures in the future 

table of contents our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
we have issued debt convertible into common stock 
if either we or the debt holders convert the debentures into common stock or are required to calculate earnings per share on an as converted basis  our earnings per share could decrease 
in june  we issued million in senior convertible debentures due in the debentures are convertible into our shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures which represents a conversion price of approximately per share under certain conditions and subject to certain adjustments 
holders may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ending september  if the sale price of our common stock for at least consecutive trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds of the conversion price on that th trading day  during any five consecutive trading day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period the debenture measurement period in which the average trading price for the debentures during that debenture measurement period was less than of the average conversion value for the debentures during such period  however  the debentures may not be converted after june  if on any trading day during such debenture measurement period the closing sale price of shares of our common stock was between the then current conversion price on the debentures and of the then conversion price of the debentures  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the indenture  or if we have called the debentures for redemption 
on june  and  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price on those dates in cash  in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash  shares of our common stock  or if we have been acquired by another company and we are not the surviving corporation  shares of common stock  ordinary shares or american depositary shares of the surviving corporation  or a combination of cash and stock 
the debentures are convertible into a maximum of  shares of common stock 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock would be dilutive to our earnings per share 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussions about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 

table of contents market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps over a twelve month time horizon 
this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon valuation of securities no change valuation of securities given an interest rate in interest given an interest rate decrease of basis points rates increase of basis points in thousands total fair market value the fair value of our senior convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decreased as interest rates rise 
the interest changes affect the fair value but do not impact our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the senior convertible debentures was approximately million based upon quoted prices 
the remaining long term debt requires interest payments based on a variable rate  and therefore  its fair value is not subject to interest rate risk 
derivatives we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in japan and the netherlands 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities  typically us treasury securities and municipal bonds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
