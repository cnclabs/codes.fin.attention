pv the pre tax present value  discounted at per year  of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved reserves  computed by applying sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and held constant throughout the productive life of the reserves except for consideration of price changes to the extent provided by contractual arrangements  and deducting the estimated future costs to be incurred in developing  producing and abandoning the proved reserves computed based on current costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
proved developed reserves 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved reserves 
per article a of regulation s x  the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and ii the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 

table of contents estimates of proved reserves do not include i oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  ii crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  iii crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and iv crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such sources 
proved reserve additions 
the sum of additions to proved reserves from extensions  discoveries  improved recovery  acquisitions and revisions of previous estimates 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
reserve life 
a measure of the productive life of an oil and gas property or a group of properties  expressed in years 
reserve life is calculated by dividing proved reserve volumes at year end by production for that year 
reserve replacement cost 
the cost per boe of reserves added during a period calculated by using a fraction  the numerator of which equals the costs incurred for the relevant property acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development and the denominator of which equals changes in proved reserves due to revisions of previous estimates  extensions  discoveries  improved recovery and other additions and purchases of reserves in place 
reserve replacement ratio 
the proved reserve additions for the period divided by the production for the period 
royalty 
an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage or of the proceeds of the sale thereof  but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage 
royalties may be either landowner s royalties  which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted  or overriding royalties  which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner 
standardized measure 
the present value  discounted at per year  of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved reserves  computed by applying sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and held constant throughout the productive life of the reserves except for consideration of price changes to the extent provided by contractual arrangements  and deducting the estimated future costs to be incurred in developing  producing and abandoning the proved reserves computed based on current costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
future income taxes are calculated by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rate to pre tax future net cash flows  net of the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to oil and gas operations 
undeveloped acreage 
acreage held under lease  permit  contract or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well 
upstream 
the portion of the oil and gas industry focused on acquiring  exploiting  developing  exploring for and producing oil and gas 

table of contents waterflood 
a secondary recovery operation in which water is injected into the producing formation to maintain reservoir pressure and force oil toward and into the producing wells 
working interest 
an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations 
references herein to plains exploration  plains  pxp  the company  we  us and our mean plains exploration production company 
items and business and properties 
general we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the activities of acquiring  developing  exploiting and producing oil and gas in the united states 
we own oil and gas properties in ten states with principal operations in the los angeles and san joaquin basins in california  the santa maria basin offshore california  the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana  and the east texas basin in east texas and north louisiana 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development and exploitation opportunities as well as newer properties with development  exploitation and exploration potential 
we opportunistically hedge portions of our oil and gas production to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
proposed acquisition of nuevo energy corporation on february  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire nuevo energy company  or nuevo  in a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million  based on our february  closing stock price of per share 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  nuevo stockholders will receive shares of our common stock for each share of nuevo common stock 
if completed  we will issue up to million shares to nuevo shareholders and assume million of net debt as of december  and million of trust convertible preferred securities 
the transaction is expected to qualify as a tax free reorganization under section a and is expected to be tax free to our stockholders and tax free for the stock consideration received by nuevo stockholders 
the boards of directors of both companies have approved the merger agreement and each has recommended it to their respective stockholders for approval 
the transaction is subject to stockholder approval from both companies and other customary conditions 
post closing  it is anticipated that pxp stockholders will own approximately of the combined company and nuevo stockholders will own approximately of the combined company 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase of nuevo by pxp under purchase accounting rules and pxp will continue to use the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
acquisition of tec energy corporation on june   we acquired tec energy corporation  or tec  the merger  for approximately million in cash and common stock plus million to retire tec s outstanding debt and million to retire outstanding tec preferred stock 
prior to 
table of contents the merger  tec was engaged in the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing and producing oil and gas in east texas and the gulf coast region  both onshore and in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
in the transaction  each tec common share was converted in to of a share of our common stock and in cash 
in connection with the merger  we paid cash consideration to the common shareholders of approximately million and issued million shares 
in addition  we paid cash consideration of million and issued million common shares to redeem outstanding warrants 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded by the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
we have accounted for the acquisition of tec as a purchase effective june  corporate reorganization and spin off prior to december  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of plains resources 
on december  plains resources distributed of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to the holders of record of plains resources common stock as of december  each plains resources stockholder received one share of our common stock for each share of plains resources common stock held 
prior to the spin off  plains resources made an aggregate of million in cash contributions to us and transferred to us certain assets and we assumed certain liabilities of plains resources  primarily related to land  unproved oil and gas properties  office equipment and compensation obligations 
we used the cash contributions to reduce outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 
in contemplation of the spin off  under the terms of a master separation agreement between us and plains resources  on july  plains resources contributed to us of the capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiaries that own oil and gas properties in offshore california and illinois 
as a result  we indirectly own our offshore california and illinois properties and directly own our onshore california properties 
plains resources also contributed to us million of intercompany payables that we or our subsidiaries owed to it 
on july  we and plains e p company  our wholly owned subsidiary that has no material assets and was formed for the sole purpose of being a corporate co issuer of certain of our indebtedness  issued million of senior subordinated notes due  or the notes 
on july  we also entered into a million revolving credit facility 
we distributed the net proceeds of million from the notes and million of initial borrowings under our credit facility to plains resources 
plains resources received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service stating that for united states federal income tax purposes  the distribution of our common stock qualified as a tax free distribution under section of the internal revenue code 
oil and gas operations we own a working interest in and operate all of our onshore california and illinois basin properties 
on a pro forma basis for the tec merger  we operated approximately of our production 
as a result  we benefit from economies of scale and control the level  timing and allocation of a significant amount of our capital expenditures and expenses 
our onshore california reserves are generally mature but underdeveloped  have produced significant volumes since initial discovery and have significant estimated remaining reserves while our east texas and gulf coast properties generally have higher initial production rates 
we have a large inventory of projects in our core areas that we believe will support at least three years of development and exploitation activity at historical levels of capital investment 
in addition  we have exploration projects at various levels of maturity including a recently acquired square mile d seismic survey in south louisiana where we operate 

table of contents we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging significant portions of our production through the use of swaps  collars and purchased puts and calls 
the level of our hedging activity depends on our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
under our hedging program  we typically hedge approximately of our production for the current year  of our production for the next year and of our production for the following year 
we may hedge to the higher end of the range depending on attractive price levels and expected capital spending requirements 
for example  assuming fourth quarter production levels are held constant at mboe per day  as of february  our hedge positions would have resulted in our having hedged approximately of production for  of production for and of production for as of december  we had estimated proved reserves of mmboe  of which was comprised of oil and was proved developed 
we have a reserve life of over years and a proved developed reserve life of over years 
we believe our long lived  low production decline reserve base combined with our active hedging strategy should provide us with relatively stable and recurring cash flow 
as of december  and based on year end spot market prices of per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas  our reserves had a pv of billion and a standardized measure of billion 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our oil and gas properties as of and for the year ended december  dollars in millions onshore offshore california other total proved reserves mmboe percent oil proved developed reserves mmboe production mmboe pv standardized measure includes mmboe of proved reserves  mmboe of proved developed reserves and million pv attributable to our illinois basin properties  for which we have a sales agreement that is expected to close in mid march based on year end spot market prices of per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas 
pv represents the standardized measure before deducting estimated future income taxes 
estimated future income taxes are calculated on a combined basis using the statutory income tax rate  accordingly  the standardized measure is presented in total only 

table of contents oil and gas reserves the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our reserves based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum consulting firms of netherland  sewell associates  inc and ryder scott company 
the reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the sec  which requires the application of year end prices for each year  held constant throughout the projected reserve life 
as of or for the year ended december  dollars in thousands oil and gas reserves oil mbbls proved developed proved undeveloped gas mmcf proved developed proved undeveloped mboe pv proved developed proved undeveloped standardized measure average year end realized prices oil per bbl gas per mcf year end spot market prices oil per bbl gas per mcf reserve replacement ratio reserve life years reserve replacement cost per boe pv represents the standardized measure before deducting estimated future income taxes 
our year end pv and standardized measure include future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves of million in  million in and million in based on price in effect at year end with adjustments based on location and quality 
based on annualized fourth quarter production to reflect the effect of the tec merger 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
many of the factors that impact these estimates are beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
because all reserve estimates 
table of contents are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data 
therefore  the pv shown above represents estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with sec guidelines  the reserve engineers estimates of future net revenues from our properties  and the present value of the properties  are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties  except where the guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations but excluding the effect of any hedges we have in place 
historically  the prices for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
since december  we have not filed any estimates of total net proved oil or gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 
exploitation  development and exploration exploitation strategy 
we implement our exploitation plan with respect to our properties by enhancing product price realizations  optimizing production practices  realigning and expanding injection processes  drilling wells  and performing stimulations  recompletions  artificial lift upgrades and other operating margin and reserve enhancements 
after we acquire a property  we may also seek to increase our interest in the property by acquiring nearby acreage  pursuing farm in drilling arrangements and purchasing minority interests in the property 
exploration strategy 
we implement our exploitation plan with respect to our properties by focusing geophysical and geological talent  employing modern seismic applications  establishing land and prospect inventory practices to reduce costs  and using new technology applications in drilling and completion practices 
description of properties los angeles and san joaquin basins in california la basin in we acquired substantially all of our producing oil properties in the la basin 
these interests included the inglewood and inglewood satellite fields 
following the initial acquisition  we expanded our holdings by acquiring all of chevrontexaco s interest in their inglewood vickers lease  which further consolidated our holdings in this field 
we essentially hold a working interest in the la basin properties and operate approximately production and waterflood injection wells in the fields 

table of contents the la basin properties consist of oil producing reservoirs discovered between and since we have drilled many production and injection wells  returned previously marginal wells to economic production  optimized pre existing waterflood operations  initiated new waterfloods  optimized and installed innovative artificial lift systems  increased the capacity and efficiency of water and gas handling facilities  upgraded tank batteries and facilities to maintain regulatory compliance  reduced unit production expenses and improved marketing margins 
additionally  we continuously update and execute new technical studies to identify more investment opportunities on these properties 
seismic technology is being utilized in to further evaluate the unproved reserves in our la basin properties and enhance development of proved undeveloped reserves conventional d at the inglewood field and innovative  passive seismic at one of the inglewood satellite fields 
interpretation of the inglewood d data was initiated in  and will continue in drilling based on the results will take place in and beyond 
this is the first application of d seismic technology for exploitation of an onshore la basin oil field 
in march we expanded our operations in the la basin by acquiring chevrontexaco s interest in the montebello field  which included a working interest net revenue interest in producing oil wells and related facilities and ownership of approximately acres of surface fee land 
a d seismic line was completed in and in we expect to evaluate additional seismic and technical studies that may lead to additional seismic iniatives potentially including d seismic or passive seismic data acquisition 
the potential value of our real estate holdings at montebello will be evaluated in what may be a multi year process beginning in in we spent million on capital projects in the la basin 
we drilled production wells and injection wells  performed several recompletions  oil fracture and acid stimulations  and completed a square mile d seismic survey over the inglewood oilfield and contiguous areas 
in we will drill additional wells  workover other wells  stimulate and convert several wells to waterflood injectors  execute various technical studies including reservoir simulation  and complete a d geologic model of inglewood incorporating seismic interpretation  and upgrade facilities to increase capacities and efficiencies 
several of the drilled wells are designed to produce deeper reservoirs at inglewood that have been extensively studied and are under exploited  potentially holding significant reserves on our leasehold 
our net average daily production from these properties was mboe per day in san joaquin basin in we acquired the mt 
poso field from aera energy llc 
the mt 
poso field is located near bakersfield  california  in kern county 
since acquisition  we have undertaken an aggressive drilling program targeting the pyramid hill formation  completing a well drilling program in in  we completed the installation of electrical generation facilities 
in capital investment was million as new wells were drilled and successfully fracture stimulated 
our net average daily production from this field was mboe during the mt 
poso oilfield is being exposed to the marketplace for potential divestment in other onshore california in november we acquired a working interest net revenue interest in the arroyo grande field located in san luis obispo county  california  from subsidiaries of shell oil company 
we also acquired surface and related development rights to approximately  acres net to our interest included in the  acre producing unit 
the field is primarily under continuous steam injection and in our net production from the field averaged mboe per day 
since acquiring 
table of contents this property  we have drilled additional wells to downsize the injection patterns in the currently developed area from five acres to one and a quarter acres to accelerate recoveries  and realigned steam injection within these areas to increase the efficiency of the recovery process 
in we spent million  drilled producing wells and steam injection wells  and installed a cogeneration facility rated to produce approximately of current electrical demand in order to reduce electricity costs and provide additional steam 
santa maria basin offshore california point arguello 
in and we acquired separate working interests in the point arguello unit and the various partnerships owning the related transportation  processing and marketing infrastructure 
we are the operator for the point arguello unit  which consists of three offshore platforms 
the sellers of those interests retained responsibility for certain abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms  removing and disposing of all existing pipelines  and removing  dismantling  disposing and remediating all existing onshore facilities 
we assumed the sellers share of all other abandonment costs  primarily well bore abandonments and conductor removals 
in we spent million on exploitation capital projects  which included drilling two development wells and converting two wells to electric submersible lift systems 
in we expect to continue with our successful workover and high volume lift programs in the unit 
in january our net average daily oil production for the unit was mboe and ended the year at mboe per day for december 
our net average daily oil production for the unit for the year was mboe p e development 
we have applied for and received all the appropriate permits or modifications to existing permits from federal  state  and local agencies to allow for drilling into the east half of offshore lease p or e p the west half of lease p has already been developed as part of the point arguello unit 
in five exploratory wells were drilled into the p and adjacent p leases 
these wells tested at rates of     and barrels of oil per day  respectively  from an oil accumulation considered separate from the point arguello field 
based on geologic and geophysical interpretations  we believe approximately percent of that accumulation underlies the e p we are the operator of p and have agreements in place between the p owners and the point arguello unit owners that will allow us to participate with at least a working interest in the development of the p e lease 
we are now upgrading and mobilizing a rig which will be capable of developing this reservoir by means of extended reach wells drilled from two of the three point arguello unit platforms 
it is anticipated the drilling will commence in the first half of while there can be no assurance that drilling will recover economic quantities of oil and gas from the e p  the earlier exploration work indicates a potentially economically viable reservoir 
gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana we are expanding along the gulf coast of louisiana from the established base of proven reserves and undeveloped acreage acquired in the tec merger 
we have entered into additional joint ventures which  as operator  will allow us to continue our expansion in our core areas 
in we spent million on exploration and development projects all subsequent to the tec merger 
our net average daily oil and gas production for this area was mbbls of oil per day and mmcf of gas per day in december state waters 
we have multiple drilling projects in breton sound  main pass and chandeleur sound breton sound area or bsa 
during  tec participated in six exploratory wells in louisiana state waters  of which five were gas discoveries 
in an additional eight exploratory 
table of contents wells were drilled in the breton chandeleur sound areas 
seven were successful 
we are continuing our work in the area to drill additional identified prospects 
to complement and extend our success in the breton sound area  we acquired a interest in new prospects we will operate in an area we refer to as breton sound extension or bse 
drilling in bse began in november with three successful wells and no dry holes drilled by year end 
additionally  we acquired a interest in an ongoing square mile d seismic acquisition program to the west of bsa 
we refer to this new square mile area as breton sound extension west or bse w 
to further build on our activities in this area we acquired previously shot d seismic data in an approximately square mile area east of our original bsa activity area 
we refer to this area as breton sound extension east or bse e 
pxp will operate in this area with a interest 
the d data will be reprocessed to assist in the identification and validation of prospect locations 
south louisiana 
we are building an inventory of prospects based on our square miles of new d seismic data in the garden city area 
pxp operates this area with a interest 
east texas basin in east texas and north louisiana as a result of the tec merger we acquired interests included in the rosewood  white oak glenwood  beckville  carthage  east henderson and oak hill fields in east texas 
the predominant producing formation is the cotton valley sand gas reservoir with indicated additional pay in the shallower travis peak and pettit formations 
there are many proven undeveloped cotton valley drilling locations under regulatory field rules that now permit wells to be drilled on acre spacing as opposed to acre or larger spacing 
at year end we had identified proved undeveloped locations in this area 
during we or our predecessor tec drilled nine development wells and participated in wells drilled by others 
all wells encountered productive intervals except one which was abandoned for mechanical reasons above the target interval 
in we spent million on exploitation and development projects on these properties all subsequent to the tec merger 
our net average daily oil and gas production for this area was mbbls of oil per day and mmcf of gas per day in december white oak glenwood fields 
in connection with the tec merger  we acquired an interest in producing wells in the fields 
our working interest varies from well to well and ranges from to 
beckville field 
we are the operator of the beckville field with a working interest that varies from well to well and ranges from to 
in december we operated producing wells in this field 
we have a non exclusive seismic license to access  square miles of d seismic data within the area encompassed within texas and louisiana 
we also have a joint venture with another company whereby collectively we will evaluate square miles of this data located in south texas for the purposes of generating exploration prospects 
other illinois basin 
in our production from these properties averaged mboe of oil per day 
we have an agreement to sell these properties via the sale of the stock of our illinois subsidiary with an expected closing in mid march property divestments 
the company periodically evaluates and from time to time has elected to sell certain of its mature producing properties that it considers to be nonstrategic or fully valued 
such sales enable the company to focus on its core properties  maintain financial flexibility  reduce overhead and redeploy the proceeds therefrom to activities that the company believes potentially have a higher financial return 
in  we sold our interest in predominantly non operated and noncore 
table of contents fields in the permian basin  the texas panhandle  east texas  the mid continent area  alabama  arkansas  mississippi  north dakota and new mexico for aggregate proceeds of approximately million

table of contents product markets and major customers our revenues are highly dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production and the levels of our production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including seasonality  economic conditions  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing and gas producing countries  the actions of opec  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had  and could have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
to manage our exposure to commodity price risks  we use various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on oil and gas sales 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
however  ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
deregulation of gas prices has increased competition and volatility of gas prices 
prices received for our gas are subject to seasonal variations and other fluctuations 
all of our gas production is currently sold under various arrangements at spot indexed prices 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary decreases in a significant portion of our oil and gas production 
pursuant to an oil marketing agreement  paa is the exclusive purchaser of all of our equity oil production from properties owned prior to the tec merger 
the marketing agreement provides that paa will purchase for resale at market prices all of our equity oil production from properties owned prior to the merger 
we pay paa a marketing and administration fee and reimburse paa for its reasonable expenses incurred in transporting or exchanging our oil 
we have agreed to renegotiate the marketing and administration fee in good faith every three years 
under the marketing agreement  paa has also agreed to  upon our request and reimbursement for its reasonable expenses  market certain of our gas and gas liquids and negotiate our gas purchase agreements 
if we were to lose paa as the exclusive purchaser of our equity production  we believe paa could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
however  paa s role as the exclusive purchaser for all of our equity oil production does have the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that paa may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions

poso kern county  california gaviota santa barbara county  california in the course of our business  certain of our properties may be subject to easements or other incidental property rights and legal requirements that may affect the use and enjoyment of our property 
for instance  of our acres in the montebello field have been designated as california coastal sage scrub 
title to properties our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions 
we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 
we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties 
we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets 
although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 
competition our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and numerous independent oil and gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our larger competitors possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
these competitors are able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry 
regulation our operations are subject to extensive regulations 
many federal  state and local departments and agencies are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual participants 
the failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
however  we do not 
table of contents believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors 
due to the myriad complex federal  state and local regulations that may affect us directly or indirectly  you should not rely on the following discussion of certain laws and regulations as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our operations 
osha 
we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended  or osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the united states environmental protection agency community right to know regulations  and similar state statutes require that we maintain certain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to our employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
mms 
the minerals management service  or mms  has broad authority to regulate our oil and gas operations on offshore leases in federal waters 
it must approve and grant permits in connection with our drilling and development plans 
additionally  the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications restricting the flaring or venting of gas  governing the plugging and abandonment of wells and controlling the removal of production facilities 
under certain circumstances  the mms may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases  as discussed in risk factors governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  might impose regulations that increase our costs and may terminate or suspend our operations  and has proposed regulations that would permit it to expel unsafe operators from offshore operations 
the mms has also established rules governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of oil produced from federal offshore leases and regulations regarding costs for gas transportation 
delays in the approval of plans and issuance of permits by the mms because of staffing  economic  environmental or other reasons could adversely affect our operations 
regulation of production 
oil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
state and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the regulation of the spacing  plugging and abandonment of wells 
many states also restrict production to the market demand for oil and gas  and several states have indicated interest in revising applicable regulations 
these regulations limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
also  each state generally imposes an ad valorem  production or severance tax with respect to production and sale of oil  gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
pipeline regulation 
we have pipelines to deliver our production to sales points 
our pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement  and management of pipeline facilities 
in addition  we must permit access to and copying of records  and must make certain reports and provide information  as required by the secretary of transportation 
the states in which we have pipelines have comparable regulations 
some of our pipelines related to the point arguello unit are also subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements 
sale of gas 
the ferc regulates interstate gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions 
although the ferc does not regulate gas producers such as us  the agency s actions are 
table of contents intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the gas industry 
to date  the ferc s pro competition policies have not materially affected our business or operations 
it is unclear what impact  if any  future rules or increased competition within the gas industry will have on our gas sales efforts 
the ferc  the united states congress or state regulatory agencies may consider additional proposals or proceedings that might affect the gas industry 
we cannot predict when or if these proposals will become effective or any effect they may have on our operations 
we do not believe  however  that any of these proposals will affect us any differently than other gas producers with which we compete 
environmental 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to safety  health and environmental protection  including the generation  storage  handling  emission and transportation of materials and the discharge of materials into the environment 
other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include  but are not necessarily limited to  the marine mammal protection act  the marine protection  research and sanctuaries act  the fish and wildlife coordination act  the fishery conservation and management act  the migratory bird treaty act and the national historic preservation act 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities  limit or prohibit construction  drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
as with our industry generally  our compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain  upgrade and close equipment and facilities 
although these regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position because our competitors that comply with such laws and regulations are similarly affected 
environmental laws and regulations have historically been subject to change  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations 
if a person violates these environmental laws and regulations and any related permits  they may be subject to significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
if we were to discharge hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment  we could  to the extent the event is not insured  incur substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage 
permits 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding and insurance requirements to drill  operate  plug and abandon  and restore the surface associated with our wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandonment of wells  the disposal of fluids and solids used in connection with our operations and air emissions associated with our operations 
also  we have permits from the city and county of los angeles  california  the city of culver city  california  the county of kern  california  and the county of santa barbara  california to operate crude oil  natural gas and related pipelines and equipment that run within the boundaries of these governmental entities 
the permits required for various aspects of our operations are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 
plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon 
table of contents non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we receive an indemnity with respect to those costs 
although we obtained environmental studies on our properties in california and we believe that such properties have been operated in accordance with standard oil field practices  certain of the fields have been in operation for over years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to comply with such rules and regulations 
in connection with the purchase of certain of our onshore california properties  we received a limited indemnity for certain conditions if they violate applicable local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations in effect on the date of such agreement 
we believe that we do not have any material obligations for operations conducted prior to our acquisition of these properties  other than our obligation to plug existing wells and those normally associated with customary oil field operations of similarly situated properties 
current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations may require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations  and there can be no assurance that any portion of such amounts will be recoverable under the indemnity 
in connection with the purchase of certain of our onshore california properties  each year we are required to plug and abandon of the then remaining inactive wells there were inactive wells at december  
if we do not meet this commitment  and the requirement is not waived  we must escrow funds to cover the cost of the wells that were not abandoned 
to date we have not been required to escrow any funds 
in addition  until the end of  we are required to spend at least  per year and  per year from through to remediate oil contaminated soil from existing well sites that require remediation 
spin off agreements in connection with the spin off we entered into certain agreements with plains resources  including a master separation agreement  an intellectual property agreement  the plains exploration production transition services agreement  the plains resources transition services agreement  and a technical services agreement 
for the year ended december   plains resources billed us million for services provided to us under these agreements and we billed plains resources million for services we provided under these agreements 
the master separation agreement provides that for a period of three years  plains resources and its subsidiaries will be prohibited from engaging in or acquiring any business engaged in any of the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing  exploring for and producing oil and gas in any state in the united states except florida  and we will be prohibited from engaging in any of the midstream activities of marketing  gathering  transporting  terminalling and storing oil and gas except to the extent any such activities are ancillary to  or in support of  any of our upstream activities 
the technical services agreement provides that we will provide services with respect to the operations of plains resources upstream subsidiary  calumet florida inc until calumet is no longer a subsidiary of plains resources  calumet transfers substantially all of its assets to a person that is not a subsidiary of plains resources  the third anniversary of the date of the agreement or when all the services are terminated as provided in the agreement 
plains resources may terminate the agreement as to some or all of the services at any time by giving us at least days written notice 

table of contents employees as of february  we had full time employees  of whom were field personnel involved in oil and gas producing activities 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
our levels of indebtedness may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
we have a substantial amount of debt and the ability to incur substantially more debt 
we have outstanding a total of million of senior subordinated notes due in which are supported by guarantees of our subsidiaries 
in addition  we have a million revolving credit facility  which is collateralized by a pledge of the equity of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our other assets and supported by guarantees of our subsidiaries 
at february  we had million outstanding under this credit facility 
we will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the nuevo acquisition 
we have been assigned a ba senior implied rating and our senior subordinated notes have been assigned a b rating by moody s investor service inc we have also been assigned a bb corporate credit rating by standard and poor s ratings group 
all of these ratings are below investment grade 
as a result  at times we may have difficulty accessing capital markets or raising capital on favorable terms as we will incur higher borrowing costs than our competitors that have higher ratings 
therefore  our financial results may be negatively affected by our inability to raise capital or the cost of such capital as a result of our credit ratings 
we and all of our restricted subsidiaries must comply with various covenants contained in our revolving credit facility  the indenture related to our senior subordinated notes and any of our future debt arrangements which  among other things  limit the ability of us and those subsidiaries to incur additional debt or liens  make payments in respect of or redeem or acquire any debt or equity issued by us  sell assets  make loans or investments  acquire or be acquired by other companies  and amend some of our contracts 
our substantial debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures  to engage in future acquisitions  or development activities  or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt  
table of contents limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt 
in addition  if we fail to comply with the terms of any of our debt  our lenders will have the right to accelerate the maturity of that debt and foreclose upon the collateral  if any  securing that debt 
realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition 
plains will incur significant charges and expenses as a result of the nuevo acquisition which will reduce the amount of capital available to fund its operations 
plains and nuevo expect to incur approximately million of costs related to the merger 
these expenses will include investment banking  bank commitment  legal  accounting and reserve engineering fees  printing costs  transition costs  severance payments to nuevo management and other related charges 
we may also incur unanticipated costs in the acquisition 
as a result  we will have less capital available to fund its exploitation  exploration and development activities 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price plus the liabilities assumed  including deferred income taxes recorded in connection with the merger  over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in our acquisition of tec  goodwill totaled million and represents of our total assets at december  goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent of any excess of its carrying amount over the residual fair value of the reporting unit 
such impairment could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity 
the most significant factors that could result in the impairment of our goodwill would be significant declines in oil and gas prices and or reserve volumes which would result in a decline in the fair value of our oil and gas properties 
volatile oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our success is largely dependent on oil and gas prices  which are extremely volatile 
any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas below current levels will have a material adverse effect on our business operations and future revenues 
moreover  oil and gas prices depend on factors we cannot control  such as supply and demand for oil and gas and expectations regarding supply and demand  weather  actions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  political conditions in other oil producing and gas producing countries including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas  the prices of foreign exports and the availability of alternate fuel sources  general economic conditions in the united states and worldwide  and governmental regulations 

table of contents with respect to our business  prices of oil and gas will affect our revenues  cash flows  profitability and earnings  our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and the cost of such capital  the amount that we are allowed to borrow  and the value of our oil and gas properties 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for oil and gas  or distribution problems in meeting this demand  could adversely affect our business 
our success is materially dependent upon the demand for oil and gas 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the demand for and supply of oil and gas  the availability of alternative energy sources  the proximity of reserves to  and the capacity of  oil and gas gathering systems  pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
we may also have to shut in some of our wells temporarily due to a lack of market or adverse weather conditions including hurricanes 
if the demand for oil and gas diminishes  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in addition  there are limitations related to the methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production  any of which could have a negative impact on our results of operation and cash flows 
the united states activities in iraq  recent terrorist activities and the potential for other global events could adversely affect our business 
the united states activities in iraq and recent terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope have caused instability in the world financial markets and may generate global economic instability 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military or other action have led to and will likely lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and gas and could affect the markets for our operations 
further  the united states government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
as a result of such a terrorist attack or of terrorist activities in general  the ability to obtain insurance coverages and other coverages and endorsements at prices that we consider reasonable may not be available 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and  depending on the ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our oil production in california and illinois is dedicated to a single customer and  as a result  our credit exposure to that customer is significant 
we have entered into an oil marketing agreement with plains all american pipeline  lp  or paa  under which paa is the exclusive purchaser of all of our net oil production in california 
we generally do not require letters of credit or other collateral from paa to support our trade receivables 
accordingly  a material adverse change in paa s financial condition could adversely impact our ability to collect our receivables from paa and thereby affect our financial condition 
if we are unable to replace the reserves that we have produced  our reserves and revenues will decline 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable which  in itself  is dependent on oil and gas prices 
without 
table of contents continued successful exploitation  acquisition or exploration activities  our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 
we may not be able to find or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 
we may not be successful in acquiring  exploiting  developing or exploring for oil and gas properties 
the successful acquisition  exploitation or development of  or exploration for  oil and gas properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices and operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities  and other factors 
these assessments are necessarily inexact 
as a result  we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property  or may not recognize an acceptable return from properties we do acquire 
in addition  our exploitation and development and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves 
our operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of inadequate capital or other factors  such as title problems  weather  compliance with governmental regulations or price controls  mechanical difficulties  or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
in addition  exploitation and development costs may greatly exceed initial estimates 
in that case  we would be required to make unanticipated expenditures of additional funds to develop these projects  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  exploration for oil and gas  particularly offshore  has inherent and historically higher risk than exploitation and development activities 
future reserve increases and production may be dependent on our success in our exploration efforts  which may be unsuccessful 
estimates of oil and gas reserves depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies could adversely affect the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this document represents only estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimates were calculated using oil and gas prices in effect on the date indicated in the reports 
any significant price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our reserves 
petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other comparable producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 

table of contents because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the timing of the recovery of oil and gas reserves  the production and operating costs incurred  and the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will vary from estimates and the variances may be material 
the discounted future net revenues included in this document should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net revenues will also be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which the sec requires to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general 
the geographic concentration and lack of marketable characteristics of our oil reserves may have a greater effect on our ability to sell our oil compared to other companies 
a substantial portion of our oil and gas reserves are located in california 
because our reserves are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors  our business is more subject to local conditions than other  more diversified companies 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  natural disasters  and restrictive regulations  that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
our california oil production averages degrees api gravity  which is heavier than premium grade light oil 
due to the processes required to refine this type of oil and the transportation requirements  it is difficult to market our oil outside california 
additionally  the margin sales price minus production costs on heavy oil sales is generally less than that of lighter oil due to price differentials  and the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter oil grades 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  
table of contents explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  and releases of toxic gas 
in addition  our operations in california are especially susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as earthquakes  mudslides and fires 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages  or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition  or could result in a loss of our properties 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
as a result  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability  especially environmental liability  is currently available at reasonable cost 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our offshore operations are subject to substantial regulations and risks  which could adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results 
we conduct operations offshore california and louisiana 
our offshore activities are subject to more extensive governmental regulation than our other oil and gas activities 
in addition  we are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating offshore  including risks relating to hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  oil field service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  remediation and other costs resulting from oil spill releases of hazardous materials and other environmental damages  and failure of equipment or facilities 
if we experience any of these events  we may incur substantial liabilities  which could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  might impose regulations that increase our costs and may terminate or suspend our operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations as interpreted by governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  vested with much authority relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
existing laws and regulations could be changed  and any changes could increase costs of compliance and costs of operating drilling equipment or significantly limit drilling activity 

table of contents under certain circumstances  the united states minerals management service  or mms  may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
these circumstances include our failure to pay royalties or our failure to comply with safety and environmental regulations 
the requirements imposed by these laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to new interpretations 
environmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
the oil and gas business is subject to environmental hazards  such as oil spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances  and historic disposal activities 
these environmental hazards could expose us to material liabilities for property damages  personal injuries or other environmental harm  including costs of investigating and remediating contaminated properties 
in addition  we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
a variety of stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of our business and impose strict requirements for  among other things well drilling or workover  operation and abandonment  waste management  land reclamation  financial assurance under the oil pollution act of  and controlling air  water and waste emissions 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production  and may affect our costs of acquisitions 
in addition  environmental laws may  in the future  cause a decrease in our production or cause an increase in our costs of production  development or exploration 
pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
some fields in our onshore california and illinois basin properties have been in operation for more than years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental and other laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these laws and regulations 
in addition  approximately acres of our acres in the montebello field have been designated as california coastal sage scrub  a known habitat for the gnatcatcher  which is a species of bird designated as a federal threatened species under the endangered species act 
a variety of existing laws  rules and guidelines govern activities that can be conducted on properties that contain coastal sage scrub and gnatcatchers and generally limit the scope of operations that we can conduct on this property 
the presence of coastal sage scrub and gnatcatchers in the montebello field and other existing or future laws  rules and guidelines could prohibit or limit our operations and our planned activities for this property 

table of contents our acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy may include acquiring oil and gas businesses and properties 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  difficulty in assuming recoverable reserves  future production rates  operating costs  infrastructure requirements  environmental and other liabilities  and other factors beyond our control  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from the acquired businesses or realize other anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
we intend to continue hedging a portion of our production  which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas 
we reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil and gas prices by actively hedging a portion of our production 
hedging also prevents us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
in a typical hedge transaction  we have the right to receive from the hedge counterparty the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge agreement over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we must pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged even if we had insufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge agreement 
accordingly  if we have less production than we have hedged when the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we must make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
if these payments become too large  the remainder of our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  our hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations 
loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our operations 
successfully implementing our strategies will depend  in part  on our management team 
the loss of members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
our exploration and exploitation success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professionals 
competition for experienced professionals is extremely intense 
if we cannot attract or retain experienced technical personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
plains does not have key man insurance 

table of contents under our tax allocation agreement with our former parent plains resources  if we take actions that cause the distribution of our stock by plains resources to its stockholders to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction  we will be required to indemnify plains resources for the resulting tax liability and may not have sufficient financial resources to achieve our growth strategy or ability to repay debt or may prevent a change in control of us 
we have agreed with plains resources that we will not take any action inconsistent with any information  covenant or representation provided to the internal revenue service in connection with obtaining the tax ruling stating that the spin off will generally be tax free to plains resources and its stockholders and we further agreed to be liable for any taxes arising from a breach of that agreement 
in addition  we have agreed that  for three years following the spin off  we will not engage in any transaction that could adversely affect the tax treatment of the spin off without the prior written consent of plains resources  unless we obtains a supplemental tax ruling from the internal revenue service or a tax opinion acceptable to plains resources of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that the proposed transaction would not adversely affect the tax treatment of the spin off 
moreover  we will be liable to plains resources for any corporate level taxes incurred by plains resources as a result of the spin off or to specified transactions involving us following the spin off including the acquisition of of our common stock by any person or persons 
to the extent the taxes arise as a result of a change of control of plains resources  failure of plains resources to continue the active conduct of its trade or business or failure of plains resources to comply with the representations underlying its tax ruling or a supplemental tax ruling relating to the spin off  plains resources will be solely responsible for the taxes resulting from the spin off 
if there are any corporate level taxes incurred by plains resources as a result of the spin off and not due to any of the factors discussed in the two preceding sentences  we would be responsible for of any such liability 
the amount of any indemnification payments would be substantial and would likely result in events of default under all of our credit arrangements 
as a result  we likely would not have sufficient financial resources to achieve our growth strategy or  possibly  repay our indebtedness after making these payments 
as a result of the tax principles and agreements with plains resources discussed above  we may be highly limited in our ability to take the following steps in the future issue equity in public or private offerings  issue equity as part of the consideration in acquisitions of additional assets  or undergo a change of control 
our net income could be adversely affected by stock appreciation rights charges 
as part of the spin off  all outstanding options to acquire plains resources common stock at the time of the spin off were split between plains resources stock options and stock appreciation rights with respect to our common stock 
stock appreciation rights are subject to variable accounting treatment 
as a result  at the end of each quarter  we compare the per share closing price of our common stock to the exercise price of each stock appreciation right that is vested or for accounting purposes is deemed vested at the end of the quarter 
to the extent the closing price exceeds the exercise price  we will recognize the excess as an accounting charge to the extent we did not previously recognize such excess 
if  at the end of the quarter  the per share closing price of our common stock decreased  the stock appreciation right accounting charge would decrease  resulting in increased net income for plains 
in we recognized million of sar expense

proposed acquisition of nuevo energy inc on february  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire nuevo energy company nuevo in a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million  based on our february  closing stock price of per share 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  nuevo stockholders will receive shares of our common stock for each share of nuevo common stock 
if completed  we will issue up to million shares to nuevo shareholders and assume million of net debt as of december  and million of trust convertible preferred securities 
the transaction is expected to qualify as a tax free reorganization under section a and is expected to be tax free to our stockholders and tax free for the stock consideration received by nuevo stockholders 
the boards of directors of both companies have approved the merger agreement and each has recommended it to their respective stockholders for approval 
the transaction is subject to stockholder approval from both companies and other customary conditions 
post closing  it is anticipated that pxp stockholders will own approximately of the combined company and nuevo stockholders will own approximately of the combined company 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase of nuevo by pxp under purchase accounting rules and pxp will continue to use the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
acquisition of tec energy corporation on june   we acquired tec energy corporation  or tec  the merger  for approximately million in cash and common stock plus million to retire tec s outstanding debt and million to retire outstanding tec preferred stock 
prior to the merger  tec was engaged in the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing and producing oil and gas in east texas and the gulf coast region  both onshore and in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
in the transaction  each tec common share was converted in to of a share of our common stock and in cash 
in connection with the merger  we paid cash consideration to the common shareholders of approximately million and issued million shares 
in addition  we paid cash consideration of million and issued million common shares to redeem outstanding warrants 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded by the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
we have accounted for the acquisition of tec as a purchase effective june corporate reorganization and spin off prior to december  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of plains resources 
on december  plains resources distributed of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to the holders of record of plains resources common stock as of december  each plains resources stockholder received one share of our common stock for each share of plains resources common stock held 
prior to the spin off  plains resources made an aggregate of million in cash contributions to us and transferred to us certain assets and we assumed certain liabilities of plains resources  primarily related to land  unproved oil and gas properties  office equipment and pension obligations 
we used the cash contributions to reduce outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents in contemplation of the spin off  under the terms of a master separation agreement between us and plains resources  on july  plains resources contributed to us of the capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiaries that own oil and gas properties in offshore california and illinois 
as a result  we indirectly own our offshore california and illinois properties and directly own our onshore california properties 
plains resources also contributed to us million of intercompany payables that we or our subsidiaries owed to it 
on july  we and plains e p company  our wholly owned subsidiary that has no material assets and was formed for the sole purpose of being a corporate co issuer of certain of our indebtedness  issued million of senior subordinated notes due  or the notes 
on july  we also entered into a million revolving credit facility 
we distributed the net proceeds of million from the senior subordinated notes and million of initial borrowings under our credit facility to plains resources 
plains resources received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service stating that  for united states federal income tax purposes  the distribution of our common stock qualified as a tax free distribution under section of the internal revenue code 
general we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing and producing oil and gas in the united states 
we own oil and gas properties in ten states with principal operations in the los angeles and san joaquin basins in california  the santa maria basin offshore california  the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana  and the east texas basin in east texas and north louisiana 
we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development activities are capitalized 
our revenues are derived from the sale of oil  gas and natural gas liquids 
we recognize revenues when our production is sold and title is transferred 
our revenues are highly dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our levels of production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including supply and demand  economic conditions  foreign imports  the actions of opec  political conditions in other oil producing countries  and governmental regulation  legislation and policies 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter  after giving effect to commodity derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting  to determine a ceiling value of our properties 
the rules require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed the allowed ceiling 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will fluctuate in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had  and will likely have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
to manage our exposure to commodity price risk  we use various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to oil and gas sales price fluctuations 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if these prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
however  if prices increase  ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive less revenues on the 
table of contents hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
gains and losses on derivative transactions that qualify for hedge accounting are recognized as revenues when the associated production is sold 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in other income expense 
our oil and gas production expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel involved in production activities  electric costs  maintenance costs  production  ad valorem and severance taxes  and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
depletion of capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties is provided using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
for the purposes of computing depletion  proved reserves are redetermined as of the end of each year and on an interim basis when deemed necessary 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits of administrative personnel  office rent  systems costs and other administrative costs

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net income 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for a discussion of the reasons for the decrease follows 
oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues decreased  or million  to million for from million for the decrease is due to lower realized gas prices that were partially offset by higher production volumes 
oil revenues increased  or million  to million for from million for a  or million barrel  increase in production volumes to million barrels increased revenues by million 
our average realized price for oil decreased  or  to per bbl for from per bbl for the decrease is attributable to hedging which had the effect of decreasing our average price per bbl by in compared to an increase of per bbl in the effects of hedging were partially offset by a slight increase in the average nymex oil price to per bbl in versus per bbl in and an improvement in our location and quality differential to per bbl in versus per bbl in gas revenues decreased million  to million for from million for primarily due to a per mcf decrease in realized gas prices 
our average realized price for gas decreased  or  to per mcf for from per mcf for the decrease is primarily attributable to a premium we received for our california gas production in in  the differential to nymex for our gas production was an increase of per mcf from the nymex gas price compared to a negative differential of per mcf in production expenses 
our production expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on a per unit basis  production expenses increased  or per boe  to per boe for the year ended december  from per boe for the year ended december  production expenses for were reduced by approximately per boe as a result of nonrecurring credits primarily the sale of certain california emissions credits 
excluding these credits  production expenses increased per boe in  primarily due to increased workover and maintenance expense  insurance expense and electricity costs in california as well as our increased ownership percentage in the offshore california properties  which have a higher per unit production cost than our other properties 
production and ad valorem taxes 
production and ad valorem taxes increased to million in versus million in due to higher property valuations as a result of increased prices 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative  or g a  expense  excluding amounts attributable to stock appreciation rights and costs related to our spin off from plains resources  increased  or million  to million in from million in this

the increase in our dd a rate in was primarily due to our capital program resulting in higher costs being subject to dd a and  to a lesser extent  to higher estimated future development costs 
expenses of terminated public equity offering 
in conjunction with the termination of our proposed initial public equity offering we expensed costs incurred of million in interest expense 
our interest expense increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting higher debt balances during and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest  partially offset by lower interest rates 
we capitalized approximately million and million of interest in and  respectively 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in pre tax income 
our overall effective tax rate increased slightly to in from for the year ended december  our currently payable effective tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the increased currently payable effective rate in primarily reflects lower expenditures that are expensed for tax purposes and capitalized for financial reporting purposes and the million in expense related to stock appreciation rights that is not deductible until paid 
tax expense and effective tax rates for the periods prior to our spin off on december  were calculated based on the tax sharing agreement with plains resources 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and our revolving credit facility 
at december  we had approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity through our cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to meet our short term and long term normal recurring operating needs  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas and the success of our acquisition and drilling activities 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging significant portions of our production and thereby mitigate our exposure to price declines 
this allows us the flexibility to continue to execute our capital plan even if prices decline during the period our hedges are in place 
in addition  the majority of our capital expenditures are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows declined from expected levels 
financing activities in connection with our acquisition of tec  we replaced our then existing credit facility with a new million credit facility with an initial borrowing base of million 

table of contents on may  we and plains e p company  our wholly owned subsidiary that has no material assets and was formed for the sole purpose of being a corporate co issuer of certain of our indebtedness  issued  at an issue price of  million of senior subordinated notes due we used the net proceeds of million from the sale of these notes to fund a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price of the merger with tec 
as a result of the issuance  the borrowing base on our credit facility was reduced to million 
at december  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million 
approximately million of the working capital deficit is attributable to the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the fair value of all derivative instruments is recorded on the balance sheet 
gains and losses on instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are included in oil and gas revenues in the period that the related volumes are delivered 
changes in the fair value of instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in other income expense 
the hedge agreements provide for monthly settlement based on the differential between the agreement price and actual nymex oil price 
cash received for sale of physical production will be based on actual market prices and will generally offset any gains or losses on the hedge instruments 
in addition  million of the working capital deficit is attributable to the in the money value of stock appreciation rights that were deemed vested at december  the remaining working capital deficit will be financed through cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility 
as of december  we had million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the credit facility has a borrowing base of million that will be reviewed every six months  with the lenders and us each having the right to one annual interim unscheduled redetermination  and adjusted based on our oil and gas properties  reserves  other indebtedness and other relevant factors  and matures in the credit facility contains a million sub limit on letters of credit 
to secure borrowings  we pledged of the shares of stock of our domestic subsidiaries and gave mortgages covering of the total present value of our domestic oil and gas properties 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear an annual interest rate  at our election  equal to either i the eurodollar rate  plus from to  or ii the greatest of the prime rate  as determined by jpmorgan chase bank  the certificate of deposit rate  plus  or the federal funds rate  plus  plus an additional to for each of 
the amount of interest payable on outstanding borrowings is based on the utilization rate as a percentage of the total amount of funds borrowed under the credit facility to the borrowing base and our long term debt rating

in the event of a change of control  as defined in the indenture  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase

capital requirements we have made and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of oil and gas 
during  we expect to make aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million on our existing asset base 
capital expenditures for the nuevo properties are expected to be million pursuant to nuevo s capital plan 
based on the foregoing  total pro forma capital expenditures for the combined asset base are estimated to be million for  assuming the merger closed on january  subsequent to the closing of the nuevo acquisition  we may reallocate capital between the two asset bases to optimize spending 
we expect that capital expenditures will be funded with cash flow from our operations and our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of underdeveloped producing properties 
we will incur cash expenditures upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights  or sars  but our outstanding share count will not increase 
at december  we had approximately million sars outstanding of which million were vested 
if all of the vested sars were exercised  based on  the price of our common stock as of december   we would pay million to holders of the sars 
in we made cash payments of million for sars that were exercised during the year 
see critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results stock appreciation rights 
commitments and contingencies contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows in thousands thereafter long term debt producing property remediation operating leases the long term debt amounts consist principally of amounts due under our credit facility and our notes 
the obligation for producing property remediation consists of obligations associated with the purchase of certain of our california properties 
operating leases relate primarily to obligations associated with our office facilities and certain cogeneration operations in california 
environmental matters 
as discussed under business properties regulation environmental  as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we have received an indemnity in connection with such purchase 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect on these indemnities 
often these regulations are more 
table of contents burdensome on older properties that were operated before the regulations came into effect such as some of our properties in california that have operated for over years 
we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
we also maintain insurance coverage for environmental matters  which we believe is customary in the industry  but we are not fully insured against all environmental risks 
there can be no assurance that current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations will not require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations 
plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically  when producing oil and gas assets are purchased the purchaser assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we received an indemnity with respect to those costs 
in connection with the purchase of certain of our onshore california properties  each year we are required to plug and abandon of the then remaining inactive wells there were inactive wells at december  
if we do not meet this commitment  and the requirement is not waived  we must escrow funds to cover the cost of the wells that were not abandoned 
to date we have not been required to escrow any funds 
in addition  until the end of we are required to spend at least  per year and  per year from through to remediate oil contaminated soil from existing well sites that require remediation for a discussion of our specific contractual obligations to incur plugging  abandonment and remediation costs  see business plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
other commitments and contingencies 
as is common within the industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved crude oil and natural gas properties and the marketing  transportation  terminalling and storage of crude oil 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as discussed under legal proceedings  in the ordinary course of business  we are a claimant and or defendant in various other legal proceedings 
in particular  we were required to indemnify plains resources for any liabilities it incurred in connection with a lawsuit it through a predecessor interest in stocker resources  inc had regarding an electric services contract with commonwealth energy corporation 
in january plains resources settled the suit 
under the terms of our master separation agreement with plains resources  we indemnified them for damages they might incur as a result of this action 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas  including well blowouts  cratering  explosions  oil spills  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution and releases of toxic gas  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
our operations in california  including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles  are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury  property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern california 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against all risks  either because insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we maintain coverage for earthquake damages in california but this coverage may not provide for the full effect of damages that could occur and we may be subject to additional liabilities 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating our pipelines  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent 
table of contents with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
industry concentration financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable with respect to our oil and gas operations and derivative instruments related to our hedging activities 
paa is the exclusive marketer purchaser for all of our equity oil production in california and illinois 
this concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that paa may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we do not believe the loss of paa as the exclusive purchaser of our equity production would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we believe paa could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
the contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better 
six of the financial institutions are participating lenders in our credit facility  holding contracts that represent approximately of the fair value of all of our open positions at december  there are a limited number of alternative methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production which could have a negative impact on future results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results based on the accounting policies which we have in place  certain factors may impact our future financial results 
the most significant of these factors and their effect on certain of our accounting policies are discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
prices for oil and gas have historically been volatile 
decreases in oil and gas prices from current levels will adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserves 
if the industry experiences significant prolonged future price decreases  this could be materially adverse to our operations and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures 
periodically  we enter into hedging arrangements relating to a portion of our oil and gas sales to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations 
hedging instruments used are typically fixed price swaps and collars and purchased puts and calls 
while the use of these types of hedging instruments limits our downside risk to adverse price movements  we are subject to a number of risks  including instances in which the benefit to revenues is limited when commodity prices increase 
for a further discussion concerning our risks related to oil and gas prices and our hedging programs  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
write downs under full cost ceiling test rules 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling equal to the standardized measure including  for this test only  the effect of any related hedging activities  plus 
table of contents the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized net of related tax effects 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
oil and gas reserves 
our proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by outside engineering firms 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than these estimates 
estimates of proved reserves may be different from the actual quantities of oil and gas recovered because such estimates depend on many assumptions and are based on operating conditions and results at the time the estimate is made 
the actual results of drilling and testing  as well as changes in production rates and recovery factors  can vary significantly from those assumed in the preparation of reserve estimates 
as a result  such factors have historically  and can in the future  cause significant upward and downward revisions to proved reserve estimates 
you should not assume that pv is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
historically  we have experienced significant upward and downward revisions to our reserves volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future downward and upward revisions to our reserve base 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves including future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the ceiling test discussed above 
in addition  increases in costs required to develop our reserves would increase the rate at which we record dd a expense 
we are unable to predict changes in future development costs as such costs are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
stock appreciation rights 
as part of the spin off  all outstanding options to acquire plains resources common stock at the time of the spin off were split between plains resources stock options and stock appreciation rights sars with respect to our common stock 
sars are subject to variable accounting treatment under us generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  at the end of each quarter  we compare the closing price of our common stock on the last day of the quarter to the exercise price of each outstanding or unexercised sar that is vested or for accounting purposes is deemed vested at the end of the quarter 
for example  if a sar is 
table of contents scheduled to vest on december  for accounting purposes one fourth of the shares are deemed to vest at the end of each quarter even though no vesting occurs until december to the extent the closing price at the end of each quarter exceeds the exercise price of each sar  we will recognize such excess as an accounting charge for the sars deemed vested to the extent such excess has not previously been recognized as expense 
if the quarter end closing price decreases compared to prior periods  we will recognize credits to income  to the extent we have previously recognized expense 
these quarterly charges and credits will make our results of operations depend  in part  on fluctuations in the price of our common stock and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we will incur cash expenditures as sars are exercised  but our outstanding common shares will not increase 
we recognized compensation expense of million related to sars for the year ended december   representing the increase in our stock price and the vesting deemed to have occurred during the year 
in we made cash payments of million for sars that were exercised during the year 
as of december   we have approximately million sars outstanding with an average exercise price of  of which million of the sars were deemed vested 
goodwill 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price plus the liabilities assumed  including deferred income taxes recorded in connection with the merger  over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in our acquisition of tec  goodwill totaled million and represents of our total assets at december  goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent of any excess of its carrying amount over the residual fair value of the reporting unit 
such impairment could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity 
the most significant factors that could result in the impairment of our goodwill would be significant declines in oil and gas prices and or reserve volumes which would result in a decline in the fair value of our oil and gas properties 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities in january fin addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  interpretation no

application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for all other types of vies is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we do not believe we participate in any arrangement that would be subject to the provisions of fin r 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in oil and gas commodity prices and interest rates 
although we have routinely hedged a substantial portion of our production and intend to continue this practice  substantial future oil and gas price declines would adversely affect our overall 
table of contents results  and therefore our liquidity 
furthermore  low oil and gas prices could affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms 
decreases in the prices of oil and gas have had  and could have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
to manage our exposure  we monitor current economic conditions and our expectations of future commodity prices and interest rates when making decisions with respect to risk management 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
substantially all of our derivative contracts are exchanged or traded with major financial institutions and the risk of credit loss is considered remote 
under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or foreign currency hedge 
currently  we use primarily cash flow hedges and the remaining discussion will relate exclusively to this type of derivative instrument 
if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  or oci  a component of our stockholders equity  to the extent the hedge is effective 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain unchanged until the related product has been delivered 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
hedge effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the manner in which the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we utilize various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on oil and gas sales 
the derivative instruments consist primarily of cash settled option and swap contracts entered into with financial institutions 
we also use interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure on our credit facility 
we assumed several open derivative positions in connection with the tec merger 
such derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation 
we determined that one such derivative position did not qualify as a hedge 
changes in fair value of such position subsequent to the merger have been reflected in income 
all other open derivative positions at december  qualified for hedge accounting 
at december   oci consisted of million million  net of tax of unrealized net losses on our open hedging instruments 
as oil prices increased significantly during and we assumed tec s hedge positions as a result of the merger  the fair value of our open hedging positions that qualified for hedge accounting  net of settlements  decreased million million after tax 
at december   oci consisted of million million after tax of unrealized losses on our open hedging instruments  million million  net of tax loss related to our 
table of contents interest rate swap and million million  net of tax loss related to deferred compensation liabilities 
at december  the assets and liabilities related to our open commodity derivative instruments were included in current liabilities million  other long term liabilities million and deferred income taxes a tax benefit of million 
during  and  deferred gains losses of million  million and million  respectively  were reclassified from oci and charged to income as a reduction of oil and gas revenues 
as of december   million million  net of tax of deferred net losses on derivative instruments recorded in oci are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve month period 
during we recognized million of income from the change in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
commodity price risk 
as of february   we had the following open hedge positions with respect to our oil and gas properties oil swaps average price per bbl average price per bbl average price per bbl natural gas swaps average price per mmbtu natural gas costless collars floor price of per mmbtu cap price of per mmbtu floor price of per mmbtu cap price of per mmbtu assuming our fourth quarter production volumes remain unchanged  these positions result in us hedging approximately  and of production in  and  respectively 
location and quality differentials attributable to our properties and the cost of the hedges are not included in the foregoing prices 
because of the quality and location of our oil and gas production  these adjustments will reduce our net price 
the fair value of outstanding crude oil derivative commodity instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a price decrease are shown in the table below in millions december  fair value effect of price decrease fair value effect of price decrease swaps and options contracts the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the swap  and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at quarters end 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market 
none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month oil prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 

table of contents the contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better 
six of the financial institutions are participating lenders in our revolving credit facility  holding contracts that represent approximately of the fair value of all open positions as of december  our management intends to continue to maintain hedging arrangements for a significant portion of our production 
these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if oil prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set  but ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive less revenues on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
interest rate risk 
our credit facility is sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates 
we use interest rate swaps to hedge underlying debt obligations 
these instruments hedge specific debt issuances and qualify for hedge accounting 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instruments 
we have entered into an interest rate swap for an aggregate notional principal amount of million that fixes the interest rate on that amount of borrowing under our credit facility at plus the libor margin set forth in our credit facility 
the swap expires in october
