this charge was primarily the result of an inventory write down of million  which was included in cost of products sold  and million in other charges included in selling  advertising and administrative sa a expenses 
due to a circumvention of controls and procedures and a lack of management oversight at fw rickard seeds  inc  the company was not able to ascertain which prior period or periods gave rise to the aforementioned charge with any degree of certainty 
as such  the entire charge was recorded in as a reduction to current net earnings 
included in the total fw rickard seeds charge is a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter  which was primarily a result of a write down of inventory due to a change in market conditions for certain types of seed  exacerbated by a lack of effective inventory control by prior management 
the entire million charge was completely offset by a corresponding reduction in the company s incentive compensation bonus fund  also included in sa a expenses 
moist smokeless tobacco products are shipped to arrive and sales revenue is recognized once a week on billing days  which occur each monday 
as a result  there are instances when the same number of billing days have not occurred within comparative periods  as was the case in versus the comparisons between these periods were impacted by the significance of one less billing day in while the company s gaap financial results reflect the actual number of billing days in the respective periods  the trend information may not be comparable due to the significance of one billing day s impact on a reporting period s results 
fiscal and had the same number of billing days  and the impact of unequal billing days on comparative results will not recur for several years due to the timing of such billing days in future periods

for the years ended december  and  outside legal fees and other internal and external costs incurred in connection with administering and litigating product liability claims were million and million  respectively 
these costs reflect a number of factors  including a consistently low number of claims  the distinctly different science related to smokeless tobacco and the legal and regulatory environment affecting the company s products 
the company expects these factors to be the primary influence on its future costs of administering and litigating product liability claims 
the company does not expect these costs to increase significantly in the future  however  it is possible that adverse changes in the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on such costs  as well as on results of operations and cash flows 
the company reported operating income of million in  representing approximately percent of consolidated net sales

the charge recorded in connection with a reduction in an investment s residual value was related to the company s investment as limited partner in a partnership that owned and leased a cogeneration facility  and it represented the company s share of an other than temporary reduction in the residual value of the lease  as determined at the partnership level 
the change in vacation policy specifically related to a revision of the period in which vacation was earned by employees  and as a result of the change  no accrual was necessary 
for the years ended december  and  outside legal fees and other internal and external costs incurred in connection with administering and litigating product liability claims  included within sa a expenses  were million and million  respectively

overall  moist smokeless tobacco unit volume for the year was stable at million cans  while it increased percent in the fourth quarter to million cans 
a decline in full year unit volume for premium moist smokeless tobacco products was offset by increased unit volume for non premium products 
despite higher returned goods and aggressive sub price value competition within the moist smokeless category  the company s unit volume held steady  which can be attributed in part to its successful new product program and increased promotional activity 
net can sales for the full year included approximately million cans of new products launched within the last three years  representing percent of total smokeless unit volume

this information can vary significantly from the company s actual results due to the fact that the company reports shipments to wholesalers  while rad svt measures shipments from wholesalers to retailers 
in addition  differences in the time periods measured  as well as new product introductions and promotions affect comparisons of the company s actual results to those from rad svt 
since the incidence of oral tobacco use by members of the military tends to be significantly higher than that of the broad adult population  the movement of armed forces personnel stationed in the us  particularly reservists  to the middle east had a negative impact on rad svt results since it only measures domestic shipments to retailers

the combination of a global oversupply of wine and grapes  an emerging extreme value category  an influx of inexpensive australian imports  and a relatively weak economy during the year  all combined to make one of the most difficult sales years in recent years 
despite improved indicators in the fourth quarter of  prospects in the wine category will be dependent upon several key factors  including the global supply of wine  a weak us dollar helping to increase prices of imported competitors wines and an overall improvement in the us economy 
the company plans to grow its wine business through continued expansion of its sales force and broadening its distribution in the domestic market 
competition  pricing  changes in consumer preferences  published wine ratings and the effects of possible legislative actions and tax changes may impact the performance of the wine business in the future

management reviews these inventories to make judgments for potential write downs for slow moving  unsaleable or obsolete inventories  to reflect such inventories at the lower of cost or market 
factors considered in management s assessment include  but are not limited to  evaluation of cost trends  changes in customer demands  product pricing  physical deterioration and overall product quality 
amounts recognized in the financial statements for the company s noncontributory defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including those for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation 
the company evaluates these assumptions on an annual basis and considers adjustments to the applicable long term factors based upon current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
changes in the related pension expense may occur in the future as a result of changes in these assumptions 
pension expense was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on average  over the past three years  approximately percent of pension expense was reflected in selling  advertising and administrative expenses  while the remainder was included in cost of products sold 
the increase in pension expense for was primarily a result of a change in the discount rate from percent to 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis continued percent and a decrease in expected return on plan assets from percent to percent 
the company believes the long term rate of return is reasonable based upon the plans asset composition and information available at the time  along with consideration of historical trends 
the company used a discount rate of percent to calculate its pension liabilities at december  this rate approximates the current rate at which current pension liabilities could effectively be settled 
at december  unrecognized actuarial losses  associated with pension plan asset performance  were approximately million 
these losses will be amortized over the applicable remaining service period which is approximately years 
during  the company made discretionary cash contributions to its qualified pension plans  totaling approximately million 
these contributions  along with higher than expected actual returns on plan assets  partially offset by a decreased discount rate  are expected to result in lower pension expense for the following provides a sensitivity analysis  which demonstrates the effects that adverse changes in actuarial assumptions would have on pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately 
million  while the same basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately million 
the company s primary business  moist smokeless tobacco  sells products with freshness dates 
it is the company s policy to accept sales returns from its customers for products that have exceeded such dates 
the company s assumptions regarding sales returns are based on historical experience and current sales trends  and there has not been a significant fluctuation between assumptions and actual return activity on a historical basis 
actual sales returns have averaged approximately percent of moist smokeless tobacco can sales over the last three years 
however  significant changes in moist smokeless tobacco can sales  promotional activities  consumer acceptance of new products  product quality issues and competition could affect net sales amounts in the future 
the company is subject to various threatened and pending litigation claims and for those matters in which the probability of an adverse outcome is other than remote  discloses such items in the financial statement footnotes 
the assessment of probability with regards to the outcome of litigation matters is made with the consultation of external counsel

management exercises judgment when evaluating the use of assumptions and estimates  which include the use of specialists and quantitative and qualitative analysis 
management believes that all assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements are reasonable based on information currently available

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
the company routinely monitors this risk  and has instituted policies and procedures to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on its net earnings and cash flows 
to manage borrowing costs  the company uses fixed rate debt and derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps and treasury locks 
all derivative contracts are for non trading purposes  and are entered into with major reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing counterparty risk 
at december  and  the company had billion in fixed rate senior notes and million in floating rate senior notes outstanding 
the fixed rate senior notes outstanding at december  and were comprised of million with an interest rate of percent  million at percent and million at percent 
in order to hedge the interest rate risk on the million floating rate senior notes  the company entered into an interest rate swap to pay a fixed rate of interest percent and receive a floating rate of interest on the notional amount of million 
this swap fixes the interest rate on the million in long term floating rate senior notes at percent 
the following provides a sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk and the effects of hypothetical sudden changes in the applicable market conditions on the succeeding year s earnings  based upon year end positions 
computations of the potential effects of the hypothetical market changes are based upon various assumptions  involving interest rate levels and other variables 
the fair values of the company s fixed rate senior notes payable are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
based upon an immediate basis point increase in the applicable interest rate at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate senior notes would decrease by approximately million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in that rate would increase the fair value of these notes by million 
taking into account the company s floating rate senior notes payable and interest rate swap outstanding at december   each basis point increase or decrease in the applicable market rates of interest  with all other variables held constant  would not have any effect on interest expense 
this is due to the full correlation of the terms of the notes with those of the swap 
these hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually takes place in the future  and the computations do not take into account management s possible actions if such changes actually occurred over time 
considering these limitations  actual effects on future earnings could differ from those calculated above 
in addition  from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows associated with foreign currency payments 
such payments are primarily made in connection with purchases of barrels for the company s wine operations 
there were no such contracts outstanding at december  or the company routinely invests portions of its cash in short term instruments 
it is the company s policy to ensure that these instruments are comprised of only investment grade securities as determined by a third party rating agency which mature in three months or less 
these factors  along with continual monitoring of the credit status of the investee companies and securities  reduce the company s exposure to investment risk associated with these securities 
at december   the company had approximately million invested in short term instruments
