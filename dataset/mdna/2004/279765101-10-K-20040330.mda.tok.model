overview we are a financial and business information company that specializes in providing information contained in sec filings in an easy to use  searchable and functional format 
we launched our edgar online website in january and began selling our subscription services and establishing contractual relationships with business and financial information websites to supply edgar content 
our primary focus was generating sales leads and building brand recognition 
we went public in may in september  we acquired all of the outstanding equity of partes corporation  owner of our freeedgar 
com website  for million 
the purchase price consisted of the issuance of common stock  stock options and warrants  the assumption of liabilities and acquisition related expenses 
in october  we acquired all the outstanding equity of financial insight systems  inc for approximately million 
the purchase price included the issuance of common stock  a cash payment  issuance of notes and acquisition related expenses 
we have never operated at a profit and our revenues have decreased from a peak of approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in technical services 
we have  however  generated positive cash flow from operating activities since the year ended by increasing seat based subscription revenue by million and by reducing many of our operating expenses 
specifically  we have reduced our workforce  which  in turn  has reduced our costs of sales  development costs and general and administrative expenses 
we are continuing to focus on growing our subscription revenues and corporate data sales and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations by offering the following products and services subscription services 
our subscription services include edgar online pro  edgar online access and freeedgar 
edgar online pro is sold by our sales force and is available via multi seat and enterprise wide contracts 
sales leads are primarily provided from the traffic to our subscription websites from yahoo finance and freeedgar 
com and from the migration of users from edgar online access 
in  we expect to increase sales leads to our services through our relationship with microsoft 
in january  after we added new databases and functionality to edgar online pro  we raised the price of a new subscription from per month or per year to per month or  per year 
additional fees are applied when the customer requests additional  specific content such as conference call transcripts and global annual and interim reports 
our mid tiered service  edgar online access  is available for per year and is purchased annually or quarterly in advance with a credit card 
revenue from subscription services is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically three or twelve months

the price for a digital data feed ranges from as low as  to as high as  per year 
prices vary depending on such factors as the quantity  type and format of information provided 
revenue from digital data feeds is recognized over the term of the contract  which are typically non cancelable  one year contracts with automatic renewal clauses  or  in the case of certain up front fees  over the estimated customer relationship period 
other services 
we provide technical services to nasdaq 
several of our technical and non technical contract employees operate  maintain and support the nasdaq online website

during and  we sold over  and  subscriptions  respectively  for our premium product  edgar online pro 
the increases in premium subscriptions were offset by cancellations and user migrations from our mid tiered service  edgar online access  to edgar online pro 
in late and early  we expanded our telesales and account management capabilities in order to sell edgar online pro to new customers  reduce cancellations and capitalize on the microsoft relationship 
with an expanded sales team we expect to increase seat based subscriptions and our average price per subscriber 
data sales year ended december  revenues in s    percentage of total revenue number of contracts average price per contract    the decrease in data sales in from was  this decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that two of our largest customers reduced their purchases by an aggregate of million 
we were able to offset these significant contract reductions by adding a number of new customers and by expanding the scope of services with our existing customers 
in  these two customers represented of data sales and of total revenue 
in  the data sales from these two customers are expected to remain approximately the same as in the decrease in data sales in from was due to the overall decrease in the number of contracts 
technical services year ended december  revenues in s    percentage of total revenue the decrease in technical services revenue in from is primarily due to decreases in the services provided to nasdaq  the sole client to which we provide technical services 
in may  the nasdaq online 
com website  that we previously hosted in our rockville  maryland facility  was moved out of our data center and into nasdaq s facility  significantly reducing our technical services revenue during the second half of in  nasdaq further reduced their technical services contract and we expect technical services revenue will be approximately  per quarter 
the decrease in technical services revenue in from is primarily due to contract terminations with two other consulting clients 
advertising and e commerce year ended december  revenues in s   percentage of total revenue the decrease in advertising and e commerce revenues is primarily due to the decrease in advertising rates and impressions due to the migration of many of our users to our premium service that does not support ads

restructuring costs 
in the first quarter of  we effected a workforce reduction in response to an expected decline in nasdaq revenues in the second half of in addition  we negotiated payments under a separation and release agreement with our former president and chief operating officer 
we accrued  of related severance costs in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we recorded a  pre tax charge associated with closing our kirkland  washington office 
these costs include severance payments  non recoverable lease liabilities  loss on fixed assets  and the cost of non cancelable service contracts for operating expenses such as phone lines and equipment leases 
we recorded an additional  in september related to severance expenses for certain employees of financial insight systems  inc in  approximately  of these charges were reversed as contract terminations were re negotiated 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of definitive lived intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  due to several fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  due to the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  as well as the retirement of assets associated with closing our kirkland  washington office 
eliminating the goodwill amortization deduction resulted in a decrease in amortization expense of million or per share for the year ended december  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
as required by sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   we performed a transitional assessment to determine whether there was an impairment of goodwill at the effective date 
based on this assessment  we recognized a million non cash charge  measured as of january   as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write down of goodwill to its fair value 
the impaired goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes  and as a result  no tax benefit has been recorded in relation to the charge 
selected quarterly revenue results the following table sets forth unaudited revenue results for each of our last eight fiscal quarters 
in the opinion of management  this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting of normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
these quarterly revenue results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly patterns or revenue results 
this information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

        advertising and e commerce         total         liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through private debt placements and the sale of equity securities to investors 
we continue to focus on growing our subscription and corporate customer base and while maintaining stringent cost controls 
assuming no further revenue decreases  we expect to continue to have positive cash flows from operations  although no assurance can be given in that regard 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to the increase in loss from operations 
capital expenditures  primarily for computers and equipment  totaled  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the purchases were made to support our expansion and increased infrastructure 
in december and january  we consummated a private sale of common stock and warrants to certain institutional investors 
pursuant to these transactions  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per share  along with four year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share resulting in gross proceeds of  in connection with the transaction  we paid a transaction fee equal to of the gross proceeds and issued a four year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on march   we entered into a separation and release agreement with tom vos  our former president and chief operating officer 
under the agreement  we were required to make payments to mr 
vos of  in  and are required to make payments to mr 
vos of  in  and  in either or we have also paid or are obligated to make three payments of  to a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of mr 
vos  one payment per year in  and on march   we effected a plan to align our cost structure with current business conditions 
these conditions include an anticipated reduction in technical services revenues related to the nasdaq contract  which began in the second half of  by approximately million annually 
the plan entailed a reduction in workforce of  which was effected in march we anticipate that this action will reduce operating expenses on an annualized basis by approximately to million 
we incurred severance charges of  in the quarter ended march  associated with the work force reduction and the separation and release agreement with mr 
vos 
in connection with our acquisition of financial insight systems  inc in october  we issued  in promissory notes to the former owners of financial insight systems 
the notes were originally scheduled to mature on october  in march  we extended the maturity date of the notes such that the holders of  in principal amount of the notes agreed to amend and restate their notes to provide for  among other things  the following schedule of principal payments  on april    on april  and  on january  at december   we had cash on hand of million 
we believe that our existing capital resources and projected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  including the note repayment  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
our future contractual obligations at december   in thousands  were as follows total notes payable and interest   operating leases  severance payments we intend to fund these obligations from our cash on hand at december   as well as through future operating cash flows and funds raised in this offering 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from four primary sources seat based subscriptions to our web services  contracts with corporate customers for customized data  sale of our technical services to construct and or operate the technical systems our customers use to integrate our data and data from other sources into their products and services  and advertising and other e commerce based revenues 
revenue from seat based subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically three or twelve months 
revenue from data sales is recognized over the term of the contract or  in the case of certain up front fees  over the estimated customer relationship period 
revenue from technical services  consisting primarily of time and materials based contracts  is recognized in the period services are rendered 
advertising and e commerce revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance  and delivery if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 
several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectibility of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these evaluations are done with the assistance of an independent valuation firm and include assumptions regarding future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized
