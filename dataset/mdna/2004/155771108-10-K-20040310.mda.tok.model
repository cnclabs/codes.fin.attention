company overview we are a vermont based electric utility that transmits  distributes and sells electricity  and invests in renewable and independent power projects 
we are regulated by the vermont public service board psb  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  the connecticut department of public utility and control and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  with respect to rates charged for service  accounting  financing and other matters pertaining to regulated operations 
on january   our wholly owned regulated subsidiary  connecticut valley electric company  inc connecticut valley  sold its plant assets and franchise to public service company of new hampshire psnh 
prior to the sale  connecticut valley distributed and sold electricity in new hampshire 
our wholly owned unregulated subsidiaries include catamount energy corporation catamount  which invests primarily in wind energy projects in the united states and unit ed kingdom  and eversant corporation eversant  which operates a rental water heater business through its subsidiary  smartenergy water heating services  inc the vermont utility operation is our core business 
our retail rates are set by the psb in conjunction with vermont s consumer advocate  the vermont department of public service dps 
retail rates are designed to recover our costs of service and provide an allowed rate of return on common equity  which  based on our july rate case settlement  was capped at percent for and while vermont does not have a fuel or power adjustment clause  it is customary for the psb to approve deferral of extraordinary costs incurred that might normally be expensed by unregulated businesses  in order to match these expenses with future revenues 
as a regulated electric utility we have an exclusive right to serve customers in our service territory  which can generally be expected to result in relatively stable earnings streams 
however  the ability to increase our customer base is limited to growth within the service territory  which has been flat for several years 
given the nature of our customer base  weather and economic conditions are factors that can significantly affect our retail sales revenue 
we currently have sufficient power resources to meet our forecasted load requirements  mostly through long term power contracts 
the sale of connecticut valley s assets  discussed below  has made available an additional mw on peak and mw off peak of our power supply mix for disposition 
we sell our excess power in the wholesale markets administered by iso new england or to third parties in new england 
such sales help to mitigate our overall power costs  but wholesale power market volatility can affect these mi tigation efforts 
vermont regulatory issues that remain unresolved are critically important to our business and a great deal of time is being spent to resolve those matters 
in that regard  our top priority is the outstanding memorandum of understanding mou that is discussed in more detail below 
in addition to the mou  there are several state initiatives that could  over time  shift utility regulation away from cost based regulation 
these are discussed in electric industry restructuring below 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million representing our share of cash proceeds related to the july sale of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant 
the sale significantly improved our risk profile relative to generation given that we no longer bear the risks and costs associated with running the plant or the eventual decommissioning of the plant 
on january   we received approximately million related to the sale of page of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise  described in discontinued operations below 
the sale  which became effective that day  resolved all connecticut valley restructuring litigation in new hampshire and our stranded cost litigation at the ferc 
we are currently considering investment alternatives for these cash proceeds 
the vermont utility continues to generate sufficient cash flow to support ongoing operations 
while catamount has sufficient cash flow to cover its operating expenses  additional project investments will require financing or additional funding by the company 
catamount is also seeking investors and partners to co invest in the development  ownership and acquisition of projects 
our second mortgage bonds of million mature on august  we are considering alternative refinancing arrangements 
currently  we intend to and have the ability to refinance the million at maturity 
the outcome of the mou and perception of the regulatory environment by the financial community may impact the terms and conditions associated with the refinanced debt 
vermont retail rates our current retail rates are based on a june  psb order approving a settlement with the dps  which provided for  among other things  a percent rate increase effective july  as part of the settlement  we also agreed to a million write off million after tax of regulatory assets and a rate freeze through january  the order also ended uncertainty over hydro quebec cost recovery by providing full cost recovery  made the january  temporary rates permanent  allowed a return on common equity of percent for the year ending june  capped through january   and created new service quality standards 
we are also required to return up to million to ratepayers if there is a merger  acquisition or asset sale by the company that requires psb approval 
in april  we were required to prepare cost of service studies for rate years and  in accordance with the psb s approval of the vermont yankee sale 
the purpose of those filings was to determine whether a rate decrease was warranted in either year as a result of the sale of the vermont yankee plant 
in july  we agreed to a mou with the dps regarding that filing 
the agreement concluded that a rate decrease was not warranted  we would decrease our allowed return on common equity from percent to percent effective july   any earnings over the allowed cap of percent would be applied to reduce deferred charges on the balance sheet  we would file a fully allocated cost of service plan and a proposed rate redesign  and we would agree to work cooperatively with the dps to develop and propose an alternative regulation plan 
hearings on the mou were conducted by the psb in december  and the psb issued an order on january  providing conditional approval for the mou 
it included the following significant modifications that the return on common equity be reduced to percent  starting january  we would begin new amortizations of deferred charges on the balance sheet at december  of about million annually  and that we would file with the psb a proposal to apply the million payment we received from psnh  in connection with the connecticut valley sale  to write down deferred charges 
on february   we filed a request for reconsideration and clarification of that order 
on february   we filed information with the psb in response to psb information requests 
we have been advised that the psb will schedule a workshop in march to review our filing 
the mou and related request are still in the regulatory process and we cannot predict how it will be resolved at this time 
however  if the outstanding mou issues cannot be successfully resolved  it may result in a formal rate investigation commencing in electric industry restructuring the state of vermont is pursuing a variety of initiatives that are aimed at restructuring the provision of electric service without introducing retail choice 
the following discussion highlights three initiatives of potential significance 
the possible introduction of a mandatory renewable portfolio standard rps that could require us to purchase certain amounts of our energy supply requirement from new renewable resources 
we cannot determine whether  or if  a mandatory rps will ultimately be adopted or required in vermont 
if the rps proposed by the psb were to be adopted  it would not require any changes in our power supply portfolio until january  page of the authorization of utility sponsored renewable pricing programs to permit customers to voluntarily elect to either purchase all or part of their electric energy from renewable sources  or cause the purchase and retirement of tradable renewable energy credits on the participating customer s behalf 
in either case  the purpose of such pricing programs is to increase the utility s reliance on renewable sources of energy beyond those the utility would otherwise be required to provide in accordance with its integrated resource plan as approved by the psb 
at this time  we are finalizing the terms of the renewable pricing program that we will file with the psb for approval 
the program will likely be priced in the form of a premium relative to the tariff that would otherwise apply 
the premium would be cost based so that it reasonably reflects the difference between acquiring the renewable energy and our alternative cost of power 
the program will require that any costs of power in excess of our altern ative cost of power will be borne solely by those customers who elect to participate in the renewable pricing program 
the authorization of alternative forms of regulation for electric utilities that  besides other criteria  establish a reasonably balanced system of risks and rewards that encourages the utility to operate as efficiently as possible 
the psb may approve an alternative regulation plan only if it finds that the plan will not have an adverse impact on our eligibility for rate regulated accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and reasonably preserves the availability of equity and debt capital resources to us on favorable terms and conditions 
risk factors regulatory risk in july  we agreed to a mou with the dps described in more detail above 
on january   the psb issued its order providing conditional approval for the mou 
the mou and related issues are still pending 
if the outstanding mou issues cannot be successfully resolved  it may result in a formal rate investigation commencing in historically  electric utility rates in vermont have been based on a utility s costs of service 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
allows regulated entities  including the company  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
we believe the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas no 
for our regulated vermont service territory and ferc regulated wholesale businesses 
if we determine the company no longer meets the criteria under sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary charge to operations of about million on a pre tax basis as of december   assuming no stranded cost recovery would be allowed through a rate mechanism 
if retail competition is implemented in our vermont service territory  we are unable to predict the impact on our revenues  our ability to retain existing customers with respect to their power supply purchases and attract new customers or the margins that will be realized on retail sales of electricity  if any such sales are sought 
wholesale power market risk our material power supply contracts and arrangements are principally with hydro quebec and vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vermont yankee 
these contracts support about percent of our total annual energy mwh purchases 
our exposure to market price volatility is limited for power supply purchases given that our long term power forecast reflects energy amounts in excess of that required to meet load requirements 
however  if one or both of these sources becomes unavailable for an extended period of time we would be subject to wholesale power price volatility and that amount could be material 
additionally  we rely on the sale of our excess power to help mitigate our overall net power costs 
the volatility of wholesale power market prices can impact these mitigation efforts 
we also continue to monitor  and adapt to  changes to new england wholesale power markets and open access transmission systems 
related to the wholesale power markets  in march  iso new england implemented standard market design smd  a significant step to restructuring the wholesale energy markets in the northeast 
the move to regional transmission organizations rto also continues 
smd has impacted wholesale power prices  related to short term sales and purchases as well as the costs of our owned generation 
although we expect that a transition to rto will impact our transmission costs  we are not able to predict the nature of that impact 
page of interest rate risk as of december   we have million of industrial development pollution control bonds outstanding  of which million have an interest rate that floats monthly with the short term credit markets and million that floats every five years with comparable credit markets 
all other utility debt has a fixed rate 
there are no interest lock or swap agreements in place 
we have million of consolidated temporary cash investments as of december   including million of non utility temporary cash investments 
interest rate changes could also impact calculations related to estimated pension and other benefit liabilities  affecting pension and other benefit expenses and potentially requiring contributions to the trusts 
equity market risk as of december   our pension trust held marketable equity securities in the amount of million and our millstone unit decommissioning trust held marketable equity securities of million 
we also maintain a variety of insurance policies in a rabbi trust with a current value of million to support various supplemental retirement and deferred compensation plans 
the current values of certain policies are affected by changes in the equity market 
credit risk we have million of letters of credit expiring on november  these letters of credit support three series of industrial development pollution control bonds  totaling million 
these letters of credit are secured by a first mortgage lien on the same collateral supporting our first mortgage bonds 
based on outstanding debt at december   the amount of utility long term debt maturities and sinking fund requirements is million for the year related to our second mortgage bonds  which mature on august  we are considering alternative refinancing arrangements 
currently  we intend to and have the ability to refinance the million at maturity 
no payments are due on long term debt for through the percent dividend series preferred stock is redeemable at par through a mandatory sinking fund of million annually 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in restricted cash related to a december  payment to the transfer agent for the million mandatory sinking fund payment for and a million optional payment 
the payment to the preferred shareholders was made effective january  the covenants covering our second mortgage bonds contain limiting restrictions if those bonds receive a debt rating below bbb from rating agencies 
the current ratings of the bonds are bbb stable from standard poor s and bbb stable from fitch 
the limiting characteristics include  but are not limited to  certain restrictions on investments in unregulated subsidiaries  the incurrence of indebtedness and the payment of dividends 
these restrictions are dependent on meeting both a fixed charge coverage and a cumulative cash flow test  and we are currently in compliance with both calculations 
inflation the annual rate of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  was percent for  percent for and percent for our revenues are based on rate regulation that generally recognizes only historical costs  therefore  inflation continues to have an impact on most aspects of the business 
unregulated business in  catamount undertook a comprehensive strategic review of its operations 
as a result  catamount refocused its efforts from being an investor in late stage renewable energy to being primarily focused on developing  owning and operating wind energy projects 
catamount s future success is dependent on the acceptance of wind power as an energy source by large producers  utilities  and other purchasers of electricity 
in addition  many potential customers believe that wind energy is an unpredictable and inconsistent resource  is uneconomic compared to other sources of power and does not produce stable voltage and frequency 
there is no guarantee of wind power acceptance by potential customers as an energy source 
the following highlights the wind related risks that we believe are most critical to catamount wind resource and weather pattern risks the generation of electricity by wind energy projects is highly dependent on site wind conditions 
although wind energy projects are developed with careful review of available historic wind and weather patterns at a particular site  there is no assurance that catamount can accurately forecast future long term wind resource at any one site 
in addition  average wind speeds and resource can vary widely in any year  resulting in significant annual revenue variability 
power purchase agreement risk catamount will only develop or co develop wind power projects that have power purchase agreements with acceptable third parties in place 
the increased use of competitive bidding procedures has made obtaining power purchase agreements with utilities more competitive 
competitive bidding generally has reduced the price utilities pay independent power producers  which  in turn  reduces the profitability of many independent power projects 
page of wind turbine generator technology risk the wind turbine generators wtgs of the size catamount intends to utilize have only been commercially available for two to three years 
long term reliability of this equipment has yet to be proven 
wind turbine technology is rapidly changing with wtgs growth in size and rated output every year 
problems with key components in newer turbine models without long track records could result in unexpected availability losses  increased and unbudgeted maintenance and repair costs  and lack of electric production affecting revenue generations 
wind energy projects typically consist of many wtgs of one particular make and model 
therefore  any failure of a key component could result in serial failures of such component throughout the wind energy project  resulting in significantly diminished revenues and materially increased maintenance and repair costs 
dependence on governmental policies the wind energy industry is highly dependent upon governmental policies and laws enacted to stimulate growth of clean renewable energy through tax credits and other incentive plans  including mandatory purchasing requirements by local utilities of renewable energy  including wind energy 
while the trend worldwide is to increase the use of renewable energy sources  there is no assurance that any particular governmental policy or tax credit or incentive program will be continued in any jurisdiction where catamount conducts business 
credit risk recent events including uncertainties concerning operations of wholesale markets and demise of major wholesale power marketing companies have increased credit exposure in the energy industry  most notably for unregulated energy companies 
obtaining or renewing corporate credit facilities is challenging and there is no guarantee credit will either be extended or renewed 
in december  catamount extended its corporate credit facility to november in february  catamount notified the lender of its intent to terminate the credit facility 
the termination is effective days after notification to the lender 
catamount is currently soliciting proposals from selected financial institutions for corporate and or development credit facilities that will meet its business needs 
catamount cannot predict whether it will be able to ultimately solicit and enter into an appropriately priced corporate and or development credit facility 
capital requirements catamount will require additional capital to pursue its business plan 
catamount is seeking investors and partners to co invest in the development  ownership and acquisition of projects 
there can be no assurance that catamount will be successful in securing a partner or obtaining additional funding from the company 
discontinued operations on january   connecticut valley completed the sale of substantially all of its plant assets and its franchise to psnh 
the sale resolved all connecticut valley restructuring litigation in new hampshire and our stranded cost litigation at ferc 
see ferc exit fee proceedings below for additional information 
on january   psnh paid connecticut valley about million  with million of that amount representing the net book value of its plant assets plus certain other adjustments  plus million as provided in the agreements under which the sale was structured 
in return  psnh acquired connecticut valley s poles  wires  substations and other facilities  and several independent power obligations  including the wheelabrator contract 
the sale resulted in a net gain of approximately million to million which will be recorded in the first quarter of the gain  net of reserves  is related to the difference between expected sales revenue for the power that we formerly sold to connecticut valley and estimated sales revenue at market rates  for the years through this represents the estimated life of the power contracts that were in place to source the wholesale power contract between the company and connecticut valley 
we will evaluate a long term sale of the majority of power previously sold to connecticut valley to limit future market price variability 
the assets and liabilities of connecticut valley are classified as held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
and its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
for presentation purposes  certain of our common corporate costs  which were previously allocated to connecticut valley  have been reallocated back to continuing operations to reflect the impact of the sale on continuing operations 
these common costs amounted to about million in  million in and million in  on an after tax basis 
we began to present connecticut valley as discontinued operations in the second quarter of based on the nhpuc s approval of the sale 
previously  connecticut valley was reported as a separate segment 
page of as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  connecticut valley s results of operations may not be representative of a stand alone company 
summarized financial information related to connecticut valley  including the reallocation of certain corporate common costs  reflecting management s best estimate of impacts of the connecticut valley sale  are shown in the tables below 
summarized results of operations of the discontinued operations are as follows dollars in thousands december operating revenues operating expenses purchased power other operating expenses income tax expense total operating expenses operating income other income expense  net net income from discontinued operations  net of taxes the major classes of connecticut valley s assets and liabilities reported as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets are as follows dollars in thousands december assets net utility plant other current assets total assets held for sale liabilities accounts payable short term debt a total liabilities of assets held for sale a related to a note payable to the company and reported as notes receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
the note was paid on january  ferc exit fee proceedings the company s stranded cost litigation at ferc was related to its june request for ferc approval of a transmission rate surcharge to recover stranded costs if connecticut valley canceled its wholesale power contract with the company due to the nhpuc s february order in which it told connecticut valley to stop buying power from the company 
in december  ferc rejected the proposal  but said it would consider an exit fee if the contract was canceled 
a rehearing motion was denied 
we applied for an exit fee totaling million as of december  in october  the company and nhpuc asked ferc to withhold its final exit fee order so the parties could continue to negotiate a settlement 
in october  ferc approved termination of the wholesale power contract and related exit fee proceedings upon completion of the sale 
the sale of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise to psnh  and connecticut valley s million payment to the company to terminate the wholesale power contract resolved this ferc litigation 
wheelabrator power contract connecticut valley purchased power from several independent power producers  which own qualifying facilities as defined by the public utility regulatory policies act of in connecticut valley bought  mwh under long term contracts with these facilities  percent from wheelabrator claremont company  lp  wheelabrator which owns a trash burning generating facility 
connecticut valley had filed a complaint with ferc related to its concern that wheelabrator had not been a qualifying facility since it began operation 
ferc denied that complaint and later denied an appeal  so connecticut valley sought relief from the nhpuc 
in april connecticut valley and other parties submitted a settlement to the nhpuc 
page of as a result of the january  sale described above  psnh acquired connecticut valley s independent power obligations  including the wheelabrator contract  thus resolving this issue 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
during cash and cash equivalents increased million  reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of million 
net cash used by investing activities amounted to million mostly for construction expenditures  partially offset by the vermont yankee sale proceeds received in net cash used in financing activities was million  mainly related to retirement of long term debt and dividends paid on common and preferred stock 
we also used million of restricted cash to reduce non utility long term debt and had restricted cash of million related to our redeemable preferred stock that was paid in january at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we ended with million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
during cash and cash equivalents increased million  reflecting net cash provided by operations of million and net cash used by investing activities of million  representing proceeds from sales of non utility assets  offset by construction expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million mainly for retirement of long term debt and preferred stock  and dividends paid on common and preferred stock 
we also had restricted cash of million related to scheduled retirement of non utility long term debt in in the fourth quarter of  we received million related to the july sale of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant 
on january   we received about million related to the sale of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise 
we are currently considering investment alternatives for these cash proceeds 
one such opportunity would be to increase our equity ownership in vermont electric power corporation  inc velco from percent up to percent  and participate in its planned transmission upgrades  with construction scheduled to begin in late and extending through our current common stock ownership percentage in velco is percent 
while catamount has sufficient cash flow to cover its ongoing operating expenses  additional project investments will require financing or additional funding on the company s part 
catamount is also seeking investors and partners to co invest in the development  ownership and acquisition of projects 
we believe that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for the foreseeable future 
material risks to cash flow from operations include loss of retail sales revenue from unusual weather  slower than anticipated load growth and unfavorable economic conditions  and increases in net power costs largely due to lower than anticipated margins on sales revenue from excess power 
capital commitments and contractual obligations the vermont utility is a capital intensive operation  as it requires annual construction expenditures to maintain the distribution system 
our five year capital expenditure plan is expected to range from million to million between and our significant contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the table below 
contractual obligations payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt utility long term debt non utility redeemable preferred stock purchased power contracts a capital lease total contractual obligations a includes power contract commitments with hydro quebec  vermont yankee and various independent power producers 
the costs associated with these obligations are currently being recovered in rates 
see power supply matters below for more information related to these contracts 
page of financing credit ratings capitalization utility total utility long term debt maturities and sinking fund requirements at december   amounted to million related to our second mortgage bonds  which mature on august  we are considering alternative refinancing arrangements 
currently  we intend to and have the ability to refinance the million at maturity 
no payments are due on long term debt for through substantially all of the our utility property and plant is subject to liens under the first and second mortgage bonds 
we have million of letters of credit expiring on november  these letters of credit support three series of industrial development pollution control bonds  totaling million  and are secured by a first mortgage lien on the same collateral supporting our first mortgage bonds 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our various debt agreements  these agreements contain financial and non financial covenants 
non utility catamount has a million revolving credit term loan facility and letters of credit  with million outstanding at december  the facility expired on november  and on december   catamount and its lender entered into the first amendment to the facility that  among other things  extended the revolver facility for two more years 
under the two year extension  catamount can borrow against new operating projects subject to terms and conditions of the facility 
the outstanding revolver loans were converted to amortizing loans on a two year term out schedule 
the interest rate is variable  prime based 
catamount s assets secure the facility 
catamount s long term debt maturities  including its office building mortgage  total million for catamount s long term debt contains financial and non financial covenants 
at december   catamount was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
in january  catamount paid off the outstanding million on the term loan and in february catamount notified the lender of its intent to terminate the credit facility 
the termination is effective days after notification to the lender 
catamount is now soliciting proposals from selected financial institutions for corporate and or development credit facilities that will meet its business needs 
catamount cannot predict whether it will be able to ultimately solicit and enter into an appropriately priced corporate and or development credit facility 
the office building mortgage matures on april  and catamount expects to pay the outstanding balance in full 
credit ratings on august   standard poor s s p affirmed our corporate credit rating at bbb  and reported the rating outlook as stable 
s p indicated that the affirmation was based upon an improving regulatory environment  a diverse customer mix  stable demand growth and low operating risk 
s p s stable outlook was based upon the company s stable utility segment that should allow the company to preserve its financial profile 
on september   fitch ibca fitch upgraded our first mortgage bond rating to bbb from bbb and second mortgage bond rating to bbb from bbb 
fitch also affirmed our preferred stock rating at bb and reported the rating outlook as stable 
fitch indicated that the higher ratings reflect the company s strengthening credit measures and lower business risk related to the rate order  which provided full recovery of hydro quebec purchased power agreement costs 
another factor was the sale of vermont yankee  eliminating the company s nuclear operating risk 
credit ratings should not be considered a recommendation to purchase stock 
current credit ratings are as follows standard poor s fitch corporate credit rating bbb n a first mortgage bonds bbb bbb second mortgage bonds bbb bbb preferred stock bb bb outlook stable capitalization our capitalization for the past three years was as follows amount in millions percent common stock equity preferred stock long term debt capital lease obligations page of critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  requiring us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies are described below 
regulation we prepare our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
for our regulated vermont service territory and ferc regulated wholesale business 
we are regulated by the psb  the nhpuc  the connecticut department of public utility and control and the ferc  with respect to rates charged for service  accounting  financing and other matters pertaining to regulated operations 
under sfas no 
 we account for certain transactions in accordance with permitted regulatory treatment  as such  regulators may permit incurred costs  typically treated as expenses by unregulated entities  to be deferred and expensed in future periods when recovered in future revenues 
in order for a company to report under sfas no 
 the company s rates must be designed to recover its costs of providing service and the company must be able to collect those rates from customers 
if rate recovery of these costs becomes unlikely or uncertain  whether due to competition or regulatory action  this accounting s tandard would no longer apply to our regulated operations 
criteria that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas no 
include increasing competition that restricts the ability to establish prices to recover specific costs  and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
we periodically review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of sfas no 
is appropriate 
if we determine the company no longer meets the criteria under sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary charge to operations of about million on a pre tax basis as of december   assuming no stranded cost recovery would be allowed through a rate mechanism 
based on a current evaluation of the factors and conditions expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe future recovery of our regulatory assets in the state of vermont and state of new hampshire for our retail and wholesale businesses is probable 
discontinued operations the assets and liabilities of connecticut valley are classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  as required by sfas no 
 the results of operations related to connecticut valley are reported as discontinued operations  and prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
for presentation purposes  certain of the company s common corporate costs  which were previously allocated to connecticut valley  have been reallocated back to continuing operations to reflect the sale s impact on continuing operations 
these common costs amounted to about million in  million in and million in  on an after tax basis 
we began to present connecticut valley as discontinued operations in the second quarter of based on the nhpuc s approval of the sale of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise to psnh 
prior to the second quarter of  connecticut valley was rep orted as a separate segment 
unregulated business results of operations of our unregulated subsidiaries are included in the other income and deductions section of the consolidated statements of income 
catamount s policy is to expense all screening  feasibility and development expenditures associated with investments in new projects 
catamount s project costs incurred subsequent to obtaining financial viability are recognized as assets subject to depreciation or amortization 
project viability is obtained when it becomes probable that costs incurred will generate future economic benefits sufficient to recover these costs 
catamount evaluates the carrying value of its investments on a quarterly basis or when events and circumstances warrant 
the carrying value is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying value of each investment 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment 
in  catamount determined that its investments in rupert and glenns ferry were impaired by amounts that were not significant 
catamount recorded after tax asset impairment charges of million in and million in  related to certain of its investments 
these asset impairments were based on bids received from third parties for sale of certain investments or the projects financial condition 
see diversification below for additional information 
revenues electricity sales to customers are based on monthly meter readings 
estimated unbilled revenues are recorded at the end of each monthly accounting period 
in order to determine unbilled revenues  the company makes various estimates including energy generated  purchased and resold  losses of energy over transmission and distribution lines  kilowatt hour usage by retail customer mix residential  commercial and industrial  and average retail customer pricing rates 
page of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets and liabilities for the cumulative effect of all temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
investment tax credits associated with utility plant are deferred and amortized ratably to income over the lives of the related properties 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such tax assets will be unrealized 
in the third quarter of  the company reduced certain income tax valuation allowances at catamount by about million  reflecting management s best estimate that deferred income taxes for certain previously recorded equity losses will be realized 
see income tax issues below for additional information 
decommissioning cost estimates accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to decommissioning costs to be incurred many years in the future 
primary drivers of changes to these estimates include  but are not limited to  increases in projected costs of spent fuel storage  security and liability and property insurance 
we own  through equity investments  percent of maine yankee  percent of connecticut yankee and percent of yankee atomic 
all three plants are completely shut down and are conducting decommissioning activities 
we are responsible for paying our equity ownership percentage of decommissioning costs and all other costs for these plants 
as of december   based on the most recent estimates provided  our share of remaining costs to decommission these nuclear units is about million for maine yankee  million for connecticut yankee and million for yankee atomic 
these estimates are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as nuclear decommissioning liabilities current and non current with a corresponding regulatory asset or other deferred charge 
we will adjust associated regulatory assets  other deferred charges and nuclear decommissioning liabilities when revised estimates are provided 
based on the current regulatory process  we believe our proportionate shares of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic decommissioning costs will be recovered through rates 
see power supply matters nuclear generating companies below for more information 
we are also responsible for our joint ownership percentage of millstone unit decommissioning costs 
our contributions to the millstone trust funds have been suspended based on the lead owner s representation to various regulatory bodies that the trust fund  for its share of the plant  exceeded the nuclear regulatory commission s minimum calculation required 
we could choose to renew funding at our discretion as long as the minimum requirement is met or exceeded 
currently  we are recovering these costs in rates 
prior to january   these amounts were applied to reduce certain regulatory assets 
since january   funds collected through retail rates are being recorded as a regulatory liability  to be addressed in our next rate proceeding 
pension and postretirement benefits we record pension and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and those assumed is a required principle of these standards 
this approach allows for systematic recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the following is a list of the primary assumptions  which are reviewed annually  for a september measurement date 
discount rate the discount rate is used to record the value of benefits  which are based on future projections  in terms of today s dollars 
as of september   the discount rate was decreased from percent to percent  in light of long term interest rates remaining at historically low levels 
expected return on plan assets roa we project the future roa based principally on historical returns by asset category and expectations for future returns  in part on simulated capital market performance over the next years 
the projected future value of assets reduces the benefit obligation a company will record 
at september   the roa changed from percent to percent 
this rate was used to determine the annual expense for and the same rate will be used to determine the expense 
rate of compensation increase we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
as of september   the rate of compensation increase was changed from percent to percent based on lower than previously projected trends in cost of living increases 
page of health care cost trend we project expected increases in the cost of health care 
for measurement purposes  we assumed a percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for pre claims  and an percent increase for post claims  for fiscal these assumptions were based on expected higher health care costs 
amortization of gains losses we can select the method by which gains or losses are recognized in financial results 
these gains or losses are created when actual results differ from estimated results based on the above assumptions 
we recognize these gains and losses ratably over a five year period 
the market value of pension plan trust assets was affected by sharp declines in the capital markets in and  while favorable market returns in  of about million  helped to partially offset the market value decrease 
annual pension cost increased by million for of which million is reflected in results of operations and million was allocated to accounts which are capitalized for accounting purposes 
pension costs and cash funding requirements are expected to increase in future years 
as of december   the market value of pension plan trust assets was million  including million in marketable equity securities and million in debt securities 
pension plan trust assets were million at december   including million in marketable equity securities and million in debt securities 
postretirement costs also increased by million for due to higher than expected medical claims experience 
of that amount  million is reflected in results of operations and million was allocated to accounts which are capitalized for accounting purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to pension and postretirement benefits

these tax benefits were passed through to the plant owners  partly in the form of lower purchased power billings from vermont yankee  which reduced purchased power expense 
we discuss operating revenues and net purchased power and production fuel costs in more detail below 
other factors affecting earnings compared to included lower transmissions costs  lower interest expense  internal cost cutting efforts  lower bad debt reserves in compared to due to several customer bankruptcies in  and the favorable impact of an increase in the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies due to financial market results 
offsetting these favorable items were increased employee related costs  lower equity in earnings from vermont yankee due to the july sale of the plant  including vermont yankee s state tax benefits  and the vermont utility mandated earnings cap described above 
earnings in also included a reversal of environmental reserves and a one time transaction cost related to the sale of vermont yankee  with no comparable items in in the third quarter of  the consolidated federal income tax provision reflected a benefit of about million related to capital gain treatment on the proposed sale of connecticut valley which closed january  
the capital gain treatment allowed for a reduction of certain income tax valuation allowances at catamount  reflecting management s best estimate that deferred income taxes for certain previously recorded equity losses will be realized 
see income tax issues below 
excluding these income tax benefits  catamount recorded losses of about million in  primarily related to lower equity earnings and lower project development revenue  offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt 
this compares to earnings of about million in  primarily related to higher equity earnings from several of its investments and realized development revenue upon the sale of another investment  offset by asset impairment charges taken for its investments that were sold in the fourth quarter of eversant recorded earnings of million in compared to losses of million in  resulting from discontinuing its efforts to pursue unregulated business opportunities  partially offset by the reversal of an irs interest expense accrual in  previously recorded in the fourth quarter of page of vs

page of consolidated income statement discussion the following includes a more detailed discussion of the components of our consolidated income statements and related year over year variances 
this discussion follows the order of the consolidated income statements 
operating revenues the majority of our operating revenues are generated through retail sales from our regulated vermont utility business 
other resale sales are related to the sale of excess power from our owned and purchased power supply portfolio 
these resale sales are also discussed in net purchased power and production fuel costs below 
operating revenues and related mwh sales for  and are summarized below mwh sales revenues s retail sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales resale sales firm entitlement rs power contract other total resale sales other revenues total firm sales and are based on ferc filed tariffs 
rs power contract is the wholesale power contract between the company and connecticut valley 
the company and connecticut valley terminated this contract upon completion of the sale of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise to psnh on january  see discontinued operations above

retail revenues change in mwh volume change in price customer mix subtotal firm resale sales rs power contract entitlement sales other resale sales other revenues increase in operating revenues vs 
operating revenues increased million in as a result of the following factors retail sales increased million primarily due to an  mwh increase in sales volume 
these sales are affected by weather and economic conditions 
in  colder weather in the first quarter increased residential sales volume  while relatively weak economic conditions decreased sales volume for our commercial and industrial customers 
other resale sales increased million due to higher rates for contract sales and wholesale market prices in iso new england  and more power available for resale in the reasons we had more mwh available for resale are described in more detail in net purchased power and production fuel costs below 
sales to connecticut valley under the rs power contract decreased million due to lower volume and lower unit costs under the contract 
vs 
operating revenues increased million in due to the following factors retail sales increased million mostly from higher average retail rates due to a percent retail rate increase beginning july   and a percent increase in mwh sales 
entitlement sales decreased million due to the october completion of a five year power contract in which we sold percent of our share of vermont yankee output at full cost 
page of other resale sales decreased million primarily due to lower iso new england market prices  offset by an percent increase in mwh sales for the same period 
the reasons we had more mwh available for resale are described in more detail in net purchased power and production fuel costs below 
other revenues increased million primarily due to the sale of non firm transmission under our open access transmission tariff 
net purchased power and production fuel costs the cost components of net purchased power and production fuel for  and are summarized below 
these costs are shown net of entitlement and other resale sales revenue to reflect net power costs to support our load requirements 
other resale sales are related to sales of excess power from our owned and purchased power supply portfolio 
the amount of related revenue is dependent on contract or iso new england market prices at the time of the sales

dollars in thousands mwh amount mwh amount mwh amount purchased power capacity energy total purchased power production fuel total purchased power and production fuel less entitlement and other resale sales net purchased power and production fuel costs as shown in the table above  purchased energy increased significantly in versus and  while purchased capacity decreased significantly over the same periods 
this shift in purchased power cost structure is related to the july  sale of vermont yankee 
we continue to purchase a similar share of plant output  but all purchases made under the purchased power agreement ppa are recorded as energy purchases 
the majority of these purchases were recorded as capacity purchases when we owned the plant 
in  based on a psb approved accounting order  we deferred about million of vermont yankee sale related costs including a portion of ppa costs that were higher than estimated costs had we continued to own and operate the plant for the full year 
this brought our overall vermont yankee costs in line with those experienced in prior years 
vs 
net purchased power and production fuel costs increased about million in as a result of the following factors a million increase in purchased power costs primarily due to an million increase in vermont yankee related costs as a result of higher output from the plant in which increased purchases by about million  and a million net increase due to accounting for vermont yankee including the sale 
the sale related items included a million deferral of energy costs as described above  and a million reduction in power costs due to state tax benefits realized by vermont yankee that were passed on to the vermont yankee sponsors 
these items were offset by a decrease of about million due to the elimination of amortizations for vermont yankee nuclear refueling outages 
a million increase in iso new england capacity charges due to credits we received in for our share of revenues from the iso new england capacity deficiency pool 
we did not receive these credits in a million increase in purchases from independent power producers due to higher volume and rates 
a million decrease in purchases from hydro quebec due to fewer deliveries 
a million decrease in short term and spot energy purchases 
a million decrease in installed capacity purchases due to lower rate and volume 
an million increase in other resale sales related to more mwh available for resale in  at higher contract rates and higher wholesale market prices in new england 
the higher contract rates were related to a forward sale in in which we sold about  mwh for the period february through december in most of our resale sales were at iso new england market prices 
we had more mwh available for resale primarily due to increased output from vermont yankee and millstone  as each plant was off line for scheduled refueling and maintenance in also vermont yankee had a second quarter unscheduled outage for fuel rod repairs 
page of a million increase in production fuel costs related to our joint owned units 
wyman and mcneil generated more mwh in and at higher energy rates 
also  millstone unit generated more mwh in vs 
net purchased power and production fuel costs increased about million in due to the following factors lower wholesale market prices in reduced revenue from resale sales by about million 
these resale sales offset the cost of power  so reduced revenue resulted in higher net power costs 
power requirements related to increased retail sales  losses  and capacity needs increased purchased power costs by about million 
lower net vermont yankee costs of about million related to the favorable impact of a million deferral of energy costs as described above and the favorable impact of a million reduction in purchased power expense due to state tax benefits realized by vermont yankee and passed through to the owners 
also  vermont yankee purchases increased by about million in due to an percent increase in our entitlement share of plant output beginning march based on negotiations with secondary purchasers 
this also made available an additional  mwh 
a million decrease in iso new england capacity costs related to higher credits in for our share of the iso new england capacity deficiency pool 
a million unfavorable impact resulting from items in with no comparable items in  including  the june rate case settlement that ended hydro quebec power cost disallowances  resulting in a million reversal of a second quarter accrual for under recovery of power costs  and a million reversal of a december accrual for estimated costs for installed capacity in iso new england due to the resolution of a december ferc order 
operating expenses operating expenses represent costs incurred to support our core business 
these expenses  excluding purchased power and production fuel costs  are described below 
production and transmission these are expenses primarily associated with generating electricity from our wholly and jointly owned units and transmission of electricity 
fuel related costs are discussed in net purchased power and production fuel costs above 
there was no significant variance in these expenses for versus or for versus other operation this is primarily related to operating activity such as customer accounting  customer service  administrative and general and other operating costs incurred to support our core business 
these costs amounted to about million in  million in and million in the million increase for versus and million increase for versus are primarily related to the vermont utility s mandated earnings cap  which resulted in a pre tax expense of million in and million in to stay below the mandated earnings cap 
we also recorded related pre tax regulatory liabilities of about million in and million in  which is expected to be used to decrease deferred debits on the balance sheet at december  other factors affecting versus included a million reversal of environmental reserves in  which results in an unfavorable variance when comparing versus  and higher employee related costs  offset by internal cost cutting efforts  and lower bad debt reserve adjustments in compared to due to several customer bankruptcies in maintenance this is primarily related to costs associated with maintaining our electric distribution system 
there was no significant variance in these expenses for versus or versus depreciation we use the straight line remaining life method of depreciation 
there was no significant variance for versus or for versus other taxes  principally property taxes this is primarily related to property taxes and payroll taxes 
there was no significant variance in these expenses for versus or for versus taxes on income federal and state income taxes fluctuate with the level of pre tax earnings in relation to permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances for the periods 
see income tax issues below 
page of equity in earnings of affiliates these are related to our investments in velco and vermont yankee 
equity in earnings of affiliates amounted to about million in  million in and million in the million decrease for versus and million increase for versus were primarily related to state tax benefits realized by vermont yankee in as a result of the sale of the plant 
these tax benefits were passed through to the plant owners  partly in the form of higher equity in earnings  with the remaining through lower purchased power expense as described above 
additionally  the july sale of the vermont yankee plant has reduced our ongoing equity in earnings from that investment 
see power contract commitments vermont yankee below for more detail 
other income  net these income items  net of deductions  are related to the non operating activities of the utility business and the operating activities of our unregulated businesses

the year over year variance is primarily related to eversant s settlement of an irs audit resulting in the reversal of a related interest expense accrual previously recorded in the fourth quarter of page of discontinued operations this represents results of operations related to connecticut valley  which is classified as held for sale 
see discussion of discontinued operations above 
dividends on preferred stock preferred stock dividends decreased by million in and million in due to lower outstanding preferred stock balances 
power supply matters sources of energy we purchase about percent of our power under several contracts of varying duration 
the remaining is supplied by our jointly and wholly owned generating facilities  and short term purchases 
our power supply portfolio includes a mix of base load and schedulable resources to help cover peak load periods 
a breakdown of energy sources is shown below nuclear generating companies canadian hydro contract company owned hydro and thermal jointly owned units independent power producers other our joint ownership interests include percent in unit of the millstone nuclear power station  percent in joseph c 
mcneil  a mw wood  gas and oil fired unit  and percent joint ownership in wyman  a mw oil fired unit 
our wholly owned units include hydroelectric generating units  two oil fired gas turbines and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
we have a long term power contract with hydro quebec and a long term power contract for purchase of about percent of vermont yankee plant output 
these contracts support about percent of our total annual energy mwh purchases 
we are required to purchase power from various independent power producers ipps under long term contracts 
these contracts are discussed in more detail below 
power supply management we engage in short term purchases and sales in the wholesale markets administered by the new england independent system operator iso new england and with other third parties  primarily in new england  to minimize net power costs and risks to our customers 
based on commitments and contracts  we expect that net purchased power and production fuel costs will average approximately million to million per year for the years through our long term power forecast reflects energy amounts excess to that required to meet load requirements  therefore net power costs are dependent  in part  upon wholesale power market prices 
additionally  the january   sale of connecticut valley s assets and termination of its power contract released an average of about mw on peak and mw off peak of our power supply mix for future disposition 
on an hourly basis  power is sold or bought through iso new england to balance our resource output and load requirements 
from time to time  we enter into forward sale transactions in order to reduce volatility of our forecasted power costs 
we may also enter into forward purchase transactions  when our forecasts reflect deficiencies such as scheduled refueling outages at vermont yankee 
for the period february through december  we sold about  mwh to a third party under a forward sale contract 
in december  we entered into a forward sale contract for about  mwh for the period january through march  and a forward purchase contract for about  mwh for april in anticipation of a vermont yankee scheduled refueling outage 
these forward transactions are in addition to our hourly purchases and sales with iso new england  however they decrease the volume of those hourly transactions 
we also continue to monitor  and adapt to  changes to new england wholesale power markets and open access transmission systems 
related to the wholesale power markets  in march  iso new england implemented standard market design smd  a significant step to restructuring the wholesale energy markets in the northeast 
the move to regional transmission organizations rto also continues 
smd has impacted wholesale power prices related to short term sales and purchases as well as the costs of our own generation 
although we expect that the rto will impact our transmission costs at some point  we are not able to predict the nature of that impact 
below is a brief discussion of smd and rto 
page of standard market design on march   iso new england moved to a new market structure referred to as smd 
some of the market changes include energy pricing now includes the costs or benefits of transmission congestion and marginal losses experienced at each location within the region 
this is known as locational marginal pricing 
previously  costs of congestion and average losses were spread across new england energy providers on a pro rata basis 
location specific pricing  based on where generators and load connect to the new england system 
generation is priced at specific location nodes while load is priced by zones each state is a zone  except massachusetts  which is comprised of three zones 
day ahead and real time energy markets  allowing participants to settle transactions involving load and generation in real time or one day in advance 
an auction based system of financial transmission rights ftr allowing participants to hedge congestion risks 
ftr holders are paid or charged the day ahead congestion value of the transmission path for which they hold an ftr  while auction proceeds are distributed via auction revenue rights to load entities that experience day ahead congestion or companies that increase the capacity of the network 
increased iso new england financial assurance requirements for market participants  based on their credit ratings and financial conditions 
in general  we own or hold entitlements to generation that can be self scheduled in the day ahead or real time market 
we have been using the day ahead market to clear the majority of our load and generation  including generation resources that we self schedule  with any remaining resources and residual load settling in the real time market 
at this time  much of the cost of new england s existing and new high voltage transmission system kv looped facilities is shared by all new england utilities 
velco is planning several significant upgrades  which have been approved by the new england power pool for shared cost treatment 
vermont has traditionally been a significantly higher than average transmission cost jurisdiction 
the new approach is advantageous to the company s cost and reliability in providing service to its customers because our load share is a small fraction of total new england load  and the facilities velco is planning improve both the reliability and efficiency ie  losses and congestion of the transmission network 
we will pay a share of such projects elsewhere in new england but the net economic effect is expected to be beneficial  and better reliability elsewhere in the region benefits vermont s reliability because of the highly integrated nature of new england s high voltage network 
however  the cost of other future transmission facilities that do not qualify for cost sharing will be charged only to the requesting entity and our share of such costs will be affected by ferc approved cost allocation rulings contained in velco s and the company s tariffs and agreements 
regional transmission organizations rto we operate our transmission system under an open access tariff  pursuant to ferc order no 
in  ferc began work to amend regulations and facilitate formation of rtos  and in  ferc issued order no 
for that purpose 
since that time  we have participated in numerous related proceedings  including discussions to create an open access transmission tariff and transmission owners agreement to govern the provision of transmission services 
in july  ferc issued a standard market design notice of proposed rulemaking to establish nationwide rules for power markets and rtos 
the rulemaking was designed to separate governance and operation of the transmission system from generation companies and other market participants and facilitate power markets with common rules 
on october   iso new england and the transmission owning entities in new england  including the company  filed a joint proposal with ferc to create an rto for new england 
certain transmission owners in new england also reached an agreement to submit no later than february  a tariff  agreements and other documents to ferc to include costs associated with certain transmission facilities  commonly referred to as the highgate facilities  in region wide rates as set forth in the proposal to create an rto for new england 
we have agreed to defer the ferc filing to allow time for the rto stakeholders review process and expect to file shortly after this process is concluded 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its impact to the company 
power contract commitments hydro quebec we are purchasing varying amounts of power from hydro quebec under the vermont joint owners vjo power contract through and related contracts negotiated between the company and hydro quebec 
page of these related contracts altered the terms and conditions of the original contract by reducing the overall power requirements and related costs 
there are specific contractual provisions that provide that in the event any vjo member fails to meet its obligation under the contract with hydro quebec  the remaining vjo participants  including the company  must step up to the defaulting party s share on a pro rata basis 
as of december   our obligation is approximately percent of the total vjo power contract through  which translates to about million  on a nominal basis  over the contract term 
the average annual capacity that we will purchase from january  through october  is mw  with lesser amounts purchased thereafter through october  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this contract 
in  we purchased about million of energy and related capacity under the existing contracts with hydro quebec 
estimated purchases under these contracts based on a load factor of percent for and  and percent for through  are expected to be about million in  million in  million in  million in and million in on january   hydro quebec notified the vjo that it is not likely that hydro quebec will reschedule deliveries of energy not delivered during the prior contract year november  through october  due to interconnection deficiencies 
at this time  we are working with hydro quebec to minimize such interconnection deficiencies through various scheduling modifications and use of interconnection facilities 
we are unable to predict how this might impact our net power costs  however  under the vjo contract  we are responsible for paying capacity costs  and any reduced deliveries would either result in purchases of energy through short term purchases  or decreased resale sales 
vermont yankee we have a percent entitlement in vermont yankee plant output sold by entergy to vermont yankee  through a long term power purchase contract with vermont yankee  and one remaining secondary purchaser continues to receive a small percentage of our entitlement  reducing our entitlement to about percent 
the long term contracts between vermont yankee and the entitlement holders and between vermont yankee and entergy became effective on july   the same day that the vermont yankee nuclear plant was sold to entergy 
we no longer bear the operating costs and risks associated with running the plant or the costs and risks associated with the eventual decommissioning of the plant 
we are responsible for the purchase of replacement power to serve our load requirements when the plant is not operating due to scheduled or unscheduled outages 
the ppa through which vermont yankee purchases power from entergy and in turn sells to its sponsors includes prices that generally range from cents to cents per kilowatt hour through effective november  the contract prices are subject to a low market adjuster that protects the company and our power consumers if power market prices drop significantly 
the low market adjuster is a mechanism in which the ppa base contract price for each billing month is compared to a twelve month average ending in same billing month of hourly market prices as defined in the ppa 
if the twelve month average market price is less than percent of the base ppa contract price  then percent of the twelve month average market price will be used for the billing month 
the low market adjuster cannot exceed the base ppa contract price 
if the market prices rise  however  contract prices are not adjusted upward 
in addition to ppa charges  vermont yankee s billings to the sp onsors include certain of its residual costs of service through a ferc tariff to the vermont yankee sponsors 
the ppa is expected to result in decreased costs over the life of the ppa when compared to the projected cost of continued ownership of the plant 
in  our vermont yankee purchases were about million based on our entitlement share of plant output 
future purchases are expected to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in in  entergy sought psb approval to increase generation at the vermont yankee plant by megawatts 
on november   the dps announced that it had agreed to support entergy s proposed uprate including entergy s agreement to provide outage protection indemnification for the company and green mountain power in case the uprate causes temporary outages that require the vermont utilities to buy higher cost replacement power 
the outage protection coverage will be in place for three years  during which there may be uprate related outages 
we have indemnification rights up to about million 
the agreement requires psb approval  and hearings began in january on february   entergy notified us that it expects that the plant output will be reduced beginning after the april scheduled refueling outage  and continuing until entergy receives nuclear regulatory commission approval for the uprate  which is expected no earlier than november this will reduce our mw entitlement by about mw during this period 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or how it might affect page of future operations of vermont yankee  but a decrease in the output of vermont yankee could have a material impact on us  given that our long term contract for vermont yankee output provides a significant part of our power supply mix 
independent power producers ipps we purchase power from a number of ipps who own qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of these qualifying facilities produce energy using hydroelectric  biomass and refuse burning generation 
the majority of these purchases are made from a state appointed purchasing agent veppi that purchases and redistributes the power to all vermont utilities 
in  we received  mwh under these long term contracts  including  mwh received through veppi 
these ipp purchases account for percent of our total mwh purchased and percent of purchased power costs 
estimated purchases from ipps are expected to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in these amounts reflect annual savings credits of about million related to the ipp settlement that is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
wholly owned generating units we own and operate hydroelectric generating units  two oil fired gas turbines and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
we are in the process of relicensing or preparing to license six separate hydroelectric projects under the federal power act 
these projects  some of which are grouped together under a single license  represent about mw  or percent  of our total hydroelectric nameplate capacity 
the ferc is expected to impose conditions designed to address impacts on fish and the environment 
we cannot predict the specific impact of any conditions  but capital expenditures and operating costs are expected to increase in the short term and net generation from these projects will likely decrease 
peterson dam we have worked with environmental groups and the state of vermont since to develop a plan to relicense peterson dam  a mw hydroelectric station on the lamoille river 
the vermont natural resources council vnrc and others proposed removal of the facility  which produces power to energize about  homes per year 
in april  the parties  including the town of milton and the dps  entered into a conceptual agreement that outlined a negotiated settlement on relicensing  including the removal of peterson dam 
in january  the company  the vermont agency of natural resources agency  vnrc and other parties reached an agreement to allow us to relicense the four dams we own and operate on the lamoille river 
according to the agreement  we will receive a water quality certificate from the state  which is needed for ferc to relicense the facilities for years 
the agreement also stipulates that subject to various conditions  we must begin decommissioning peterson dam in about years 
the agreement requires psb approval of full rate recovery related to decommissioning the peterson dam including full rate recovery of replacement power costs when the dam is out of service

we anticipate the psb will establish a schedule for additional testimony  di scovery and an order in we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear generating companies we are one of several sponsor companies with ownership interests in maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic 
we are responsible for paying our ownership percentage of decommissioning costs and all other costs for each plant 
these companies have permanently shut down generating activities and are conducting decommissioning activities 
we also have a percent joint ownership interest in millstone unit our obligations related to the eventual decommissioning of the vermont yankee plant ceased when the plant was sold to entergy on july  millstone unit we have an external trust dedicated to funding our joint ownership share of future decommissioning for millstone unit as a joint owner  we are responsible for our share of nuclear decommissioning costs 
contributions to the millstone unit trust fund have been suspended based on the lead owner s representation to various regulatory bodies that the trust fund  for its share of the plant  exceeded the nuclear regulatory commission s minimum calculation required 
we could choose to renew funding at our own discretion as long as the minimum requirement is met or exceeded 
page of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic our share of estimated future payments related to the decommissioning of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic  based on current forecasts for each plant  are as follows dollars in millions date of study total obligation a remaining obligation b revenue requirements c company share d maine yankee connecticut yankee yankee atomic a estimated total decommissioning cost for each plant in dollars

c estimated future payments required by the sponsor companies to recover estimated decommissioning and all other costs for and forward  in nominal dollars 
for maine yankee and connecticut yankee includes collections for required contributions to spent fuel funds as described below 
yankee atomic has already collected and paid these required contributions 
d represents our share of revenue requirements based on our ownership percentages 
for yankee atomic  this includes million related to see discussion below for more detail 
maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic are seeking recovery of fuel storage related costs stemming from the default of the united states department of energy doe under the fuel disposal contracts that were mandated by the united states congress under the high level waste act 
these damage claims are now pending in the federal court of claims 
the trial is expected to begin in july the fuel storage related costs associated with the damage claims are included in each company s estimated total obligation  shown in the table above 
none of the plants have included any allowance for potential recovery of these claims in their estimates 
our share of each plant s estimated revenue requirements is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as either regulatory assets or other deferred charges  and nuclear decommissioning liabilities current and non current 
at december   we had regulatory assets of about million related to maine yankee and million related to connecticut yankee 
these estimated costs are being collected from our customers through existing retail and wholesale rate tariffs 
at december   we also had other deferred charges of about million related to incremental dismantling costs for connecticut yankee and million for yankee atomic 
these amounts are not currently being collected from customers through existing rates 
on october   the psb approved an accounting order for treatment of these incremental costs as other deferred charges  to be addressed in its next rate proceeding 
we will adjust the associated regulatory assets  other deferred char ges and nuclear decommissioning liabilities when revised estimates are provided 
maine yankee we have a percent ownership interest in maine yankee 
costs billed by maine yankee are expected to change in response to their october  filing at ferc 
maine yankee s current billings to sponsor companies are based on their rate case settlement approved by ferc on june  under which costs were to be recovered through october in that settlement  maine yankee also agreed to file a ferc rate proceeding with an effective date for new rates no later than january  in the current filing the cost recovery period is proposed to extend to connecticut yankee we have a percent ownership interest in connecticut yankee 
costs currently billed by connecticut yankee are based on its most recent ferc approved rates  which became effective september   for collection through these amounts are being collected from our customers through existing rates 
connecticut yankee is involved in a contract dispute with bechtel power corporation bechtel  which resulted in termination of the decommissioning services contract between connecticut yankee and bechtel 
this is a commercial contract dispute regarding bechtel s performance  it is not related to safety  security or workmanship issues 
as a result of contract termination  on july   connecticut yankee became the general contractor for the decommissioning 
on june   bechtel responded to the notice of termination by filing a complaint for breach of contract  misrepresentation  and bad faith  in connecticut superior court 
after the contract termination  bechtel amended its complaint to allege additional contract breaches including wrongful termination by connecticut yankee 
page of on august   connecticut yankee formally denied the allegations of bechtel s amended complaint and filed a counterclaim 
it alleges various material breaches of contract that justified bechtel s termination  along with misrepresentation and bad faith 
it also requests that bechtel be found responsible for project costs in excess of bechtel s unpaid contract balance  and for other damages 
the lawsuit has been assigned to the complex litigation docket and has been set for a jury trial beginning may  connecticut yankee also notified bechtel s surety of its intention to file a claim under the performance bond 
at connecticut yankees december board of directors meeting  the board endorsed an updated estimate of the costs for the plant s decommissioning project 
this updated cost estimate referred to as the estimate of approximately million  covers the time period through and represents an aggregate increase of approximately million in nominal dollars over the cost estimate in its ferc rate case settlement  which covered the same time period 
it also includes increased costs from a november updated estimate which were related to projected costs of spent fuel storage  security  and liability and property insurance 
the estimate represents an increase of about million in dollars 
prior to the approval of the cost estimate in the ferc settlement  connecticut yankee had also incurred about million for decommissioning costs in the timeframe 
the estimate is still undergoing review  it reflects the fact that connecticut yankee is now directly managing the work self performing to complete decommissioning of the plant following the default termination of bechtel as described above 
connecticut yankee intends to update the estimate based on additional information when available including the results of competitive bidding of project work such as demolition 
the estimate does not include any allowance for relief of the bechtel contract dispute or the doe damage claim described above 
connecticut yankee is also beginning the preparation of a rate case application that is required to be filed with ferc by july  under the terms of its ferc rate case settlement 
while connecticut yankee has not determined the relief it will seek in the forthcoming application  it anticipates that annual decommissioning collections would have to be increased significantly  beginning january  to support anticipated project cash flow over the next several years and to fund long term fuel storage through our estimated aggregate obligation related to connecticut yankee is about million 
the timing  amount and outcome of these filings cannot be predicted at this time 
we believe our share of connecticut yankee s decommissioning costs are probable of recovery in future rate proceedings 
yankee atomic we have a percent ownership interest in yankee atomic 
billings from yankee atomic ended in july based on their determination that they had collected sufficient funds to complete the decommissioning effort 
we are not currently collecting yankee atomic costs in retail rates 
in late  yankee atomic revised its cost estimate for decommissioning the plant  reflecting an increase of about million over prior estimates utilized by ferc 
the increase was attributable to increases in projected costs of spent fuel storage  security  and liability and property insurance 
in april  yankee atomic filed with ferc for new rates to collect these costs from sponsor companies 
ferc approved the resumption of billings starting june for a recovery period through  subject to refund 
the company expects its share of these costs will be recoverable in future rates 
in  our share of yankee atomic s billings amounted to about million 
based on a psb approved accounting order  we are deferring these costs

excluding these income tax benefits  catamount recorded losses of about million in  primarily due to lower equity earnings and lower project development revenue  offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt 
this compares to earnings of million in and losses of million in its earnings compared to reflect higher equity in earnings from several of its investments and realized development revenue upon the sale of one of its investments in the fourth quarter of  offset by after tax asset impairment charges of million taken for its investments that were sold in the fourth quarter of also in  catamount had after tax asset impairment charges of about million related to several of its investments

sewhs had earnings of million in  million in and million in overall  eversant s earnings were million  versus net losses of million in and million in in early  we discontinued eversant s efforts to pursue unregulated business opportunities except for sewhs 
income tax issues we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
under this method  deferred income taxes result from applying the statutory rates to the differences between the book and tax basis of asset and liabilities 
valuation allowances sfas no 
prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
from january  to december   the valuation allowance decreased by about million 
all other deferred income taxes are expected to be realized 
the million decrease is related to the following in the third quarter of  management determined that the connecticut valley sale agreement was more likely than not to occur  which afforded the company the opportunity to realize capital gains on the sale 
the capital gains treatment allowed for a million reduction of certain tax valuation allowances at catamount 
these tax valuation allowances were primarily related to previously recorded equity losses resulting from fourth quarter asset impairments charges taken at catamount for certain of its investments 
at that time  the company had determined that it was more likely than not that current or future income tax benefits would not be realized for these asset impairment charges  and it was management s best estimate that it would not realize enough capital gains to offset the potential capital losses resulting from the asset impairment charges 
page of in the third quarter of  the company reduced the valuation allowance and corresponding deferred tax asset by about million due to the reclassification of an equity method of accounting adjustment related to the financial statements from one of catamounts foreign projects 
this reclassification did not impact earnings 
during additional valuation allowances of about million were established for certain foreign losses related to catamount s foreign investments 
management determined that it is more likely than not that a current or future income tax benefit would not be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk regulatory risk electric utility rates in vermont are based on a utility s costs of service 
as such  we are subject to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
which allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
if we determine the company no longer meets the criteria under sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary charge to operations of about million pre tax basis as of december   assuming no stranded cost recovery would be allowed through a rate mechanism 
if retail competition is implemented in our vermont service territory  we are unable to predict the impact on our revenues  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers or the margins that will be realized on retail sales of electricity  if any such sales are sought 
interest rate risk as of december   we have million of industrial development pollution control bonds outstanding million with an interest rate that floats monthly based on short term credit markets and million that floats every five years based on comparable credit markets 
all other utility debt has a fixed rate 
there are no interest lock or swap agreements in place 
consolidated temporary cash investments amounted to million at december   including million related to the non utility business 
interest rate changes could also affect estimates of pension and other benefit liabilities and expenses that could potentially require contributions to the pension trusts 
equity market risk as of december   the pension trust and millstone unit decommissioning trust held marketable equity securities of million and million  respectively 
we also maintain a variety of insurance policies in a rabbi trust with a current value of million 
the current values of certain policies are affected by changes in the equity market

no payments are due on long term debt for through the second mortgage bonds covenants contain limiting restrictions if those bonds receive a debt rating below bbb from rating agencies 
the current ratings of the bonds are bbb stable from standard poor s and bbb stable from fitch 
the limiting characteristics include  but are not limited to  certain restrictions on investments in unregulated subsidiaries  the incurrence of indebtedness and the payment of dividends 
these restrictions are dependent on meeting both a fixed charge coverage and a cumulative cash flow test 
we are currently in compliance with both calculations 
unregulated business catamount credit risk in december  catamount extended its corporate credit facility to november in february  catamount notified the lender of its intent to terminate the credit facility the termination is effective days after such notification 
catamount is currently soliciting proposals from selected financial institutions for corporate and or development credit facilities to meet its business needs
