table of contents development  manufacturing  test and delivery of the fluids and combustion facility and associated subsystems 
the contract ends in november  however  upon our completion of contract defined deliverables  our effort on this contract will end 
at this time  we anticipate completion in the latter part of advanced biosystems segment the company s role in bio defense began in when it established its advanced biosystems abs subsidiary 
since then  an elite group of biologists  immunologists and other researchers have conducted research to develop effective medical defenses and treatments for anthrax  smallpox and other biological warfare agents 
some of these researchers are also on the faculty of george mason university and also provide research services to that university s national center for biodefense 
abs scientists have advised congress  members of the bush administration  department of defense officials and senior members of the medical community on strategies for bio defense 
abs also provides training on biological warfare agents  their effects  and defensive strategies to improve preparedness 
abs has been awarded almost million in contracts with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa 
abs has filed patent applications with respect to novel scientific and research insights into pathogenic processes and the effects of experimental agents in interrupting toxic pathways  but none of these patent applications have yet been reviewed by the patent and trademark office 
parties such as abs that are interested in performing federally funded research apply for available research grants and are selected on the basis of expertise  past research activity and research plans 
the grants mandate that contract researchers submit regular reports on the progress of their research 
award grantees submit invoices and are paid on a regular basis  usually monthly  for their actual costs incurred in performing research  up to the total amount of the grant 
as with any government contract  these research grants are terminable at the convenience of the government at any time 
moreover  it is possible that congress or the government agencies that administer government research programs will decide to scale back programs or terminate them 
in certain cases with respect to on going programs of research  there are opportunities to receive additional grants upon the achievement of stated research objectives 
under the defense federal acquisition regulations and the federal acquisition regulation  abs owns any intellectual property developed under its darpa and nih contracts  respectively  subject to a non exclusive  royalty free license to the us government 
although abs has not yet developed technologies or products that would be subject to federal regulations  any technologies or products which abs may develop may be subject to the regulatory processes of the federal drug administration or other governmental agencies 
government procurement and significant customers the principal customer for the company s services is the us government 
the company s sales to the us government and its prime contractors represented approximately of total net sales during the company s twelve months ended december    and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the principal us government customer is the department of defense  which  directly or through its prime contractors  accounted for approximately   and of the company s revenues in the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
with the acquisition of the former analex corporation in november  nasa became a significant customer  generating and of revenues for the twelve months ended december  and approximately of our revenue for fiscal year came from one prime contract with nasa  which has a potential nine year and four month contract term if all options are exercised 
in addition  the homeland security group s contract with one department of defense customer generated of the company s revenues and of the company s operating income for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents during  the company derived revenues from subcontracts with northrop grumman and qss group  inc  which in the aggregate comprised and  respectively  of the company s total revenues for the year 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated as a prime contractor to the federal government and approximately of the company s revenues were generated as a subcontractor to a prime contractor to the federal government during the year ended december  the company s contracts with the us government are subject to the availability of funds through annual appropriations  may be terminated by the government for its convenience at any time  and generally do not require the purchase of a fixed quantity of services or products 
reductions in us government defense spending could adversely affect the company s operating results 
while the company is not aware of present or anticipated reductions in us government spending on specific programs or contracts  there can be no assurance that such reductions will not occur or that decreases in us government defense spending in general will not have an adverse effect on the company s revenues in the future 
contracts with the us government are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
the company has been a contractor or subcontractor with the department of defense continuously since with periodic renewals 
during this time  neither the company nor its subsidiaries have experienced any material adjustment of profits under its contracts 
however  no assurance can be given that the department of defense will not seek and obtain an adjustment of profits in the future 
all us government contracts contain clauses that allow for the termination of contracts at the convenience of the us government 
the preponderance of the company s technical and professional services business with the department of defense and other governmental agencies is obtained through competitive procurement and through follow on services related to existing business 
in certain instances  however  the company acquires such service contracts because of special professional competency or proprietary knowledge in specific subject areas 
government contracts direct and indirect contracts with government defense and intelligence agencies comprise the majority of the company s business base 
during  of the company s contracts were cost reimbursement  were time and materials  and were firm fixed price 
following are brief descriptions of the various types of contracts the company receives from the government 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs  to the extent prescribed in the contract  plus a profit component 
these contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed without the approval of the contracting officer 
cost reimbursement contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed price contract 
cost reimbursement contracts covered by the federal acquisition regulation require an audit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs 
if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to recover those costs 
time and materials t m contracts provide for acquiring services on the basis of direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates 
a t m contract may also provide for acquiring materials  including  if appropriate  material handling costs 
profit margins on t m contracts fluctuate based on the difference between negotiated billing rates and actual labor and overhead costs directly charged or allocated to such contracts 
we assume the risk that a contract s costs of performance may exceed the negotiated hourly rates 
firm fixed price contracts provide for delivery of products or services for a price that is negotiated in advance on the basis of the contractor s cost experience 
the price is not subject to any adjustment unless there is a change in the scope of work 
profit margins increase to the extent that costs are below the contracted amounts 
if the costs exceed the estimates  profit margins decrease and a loss may be realized on the contract 

table of contents contract backlog the company s backlog of orders  based on remaining contract value  believed to be firm as of december  was approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to the analex segment and million was attributable to the abs segment 
the portion of the total backlog expected to be realized within is million 
funded backlog as of december  was approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to the abs segment 
we expect to consume all of the funded backlog during included in the backlog approximation are amounts from future years of government contracts under which the government has the right to exercise an option for the company to perform services 
competition in general  the industry in which the company operates includes a large number of competitors of varying sizes 
competition within the information technology and government contracting arenas is intense 
the company maintains a primary commitment to its current direct and indirect government clients  while intensifying its business development efforts to win additional government clients 
the company is continuing efforts to diversify its client base 
the analex segment generally competes against federal systems integrators such as anteon international corporation  caci international inc  computer sciences corporation  and science applications international corporation  among others including a variety of small  privately held government contractors offering information technology and systems engineering services to the us government 
in addition  the systems engineering group competes against large aerospace contractors such as boeing and lockheed martin and other small privately held firms in the provision of launch related services 
selection is based primarily on a combination of the price of services and evaluation of technical capability  as well as past performance  quality of service and responsiveness to client requirements 
within the analex segment  the company believes that the homeland security group has a competitive advantage in its skilled engineers and customer relationships within the intelligence community and in its expertise and experience with independent verification and validation of space launch vehicles 
however  larger government contractors can provide a breadth of professional offerings that the smaller homeland security group may not be able to match 
the company also believes that the systems engineering group has a competitive advantage in space launch support  especially in the expendable launch vehicle support segment  arising from the company s work on the elvis contract 
given the company s size  larger government contractors operating in this business area may be able to provide a breadth of service offerings beyond the company s capabilities 
the abs segment s main competition comes from individual research professionals and research groups at academic institutions seeking government funded research work 
abs competes for research grants on the basis of scientific expertise  past research activity and past performance under previous research grants 
in the event that any technologies or products are developed based on abs research  abs will likely compete against a variety of large and small biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses 
employees as of december   the company including its subsidiaries employed approximately people including full time  part time and casual employees 
of the employees  are members of unions  and employee relations are believed by management to be generally good 
in october  the company entered into a three year collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters now representing approximately employees on the nasa elvis contract at vandenberg air force base in california 
in february  the company entered into a three year collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers now representing approximately employees on the nasa elvis contract at the kennedy space center in florida

item legal proceedings the company was served on october  with a complaint filed by swales associates  inc in the maryland circuit court for prince george s county alleging breach of contract and other claims relating to swales termination as a subcontractor under the company s elvis contract with nasa 
management believes that the allegation is without merit and is vigorously contesting the complaint 
management believes and will assert that it validly exercised its contractual right to terminate the subcontract for analex s convenience and that termination of swales occurred only after nasa was informed of swales cost overruns and negotiations with swales failed to yield an acceptable alternative 
the company will assert that swales entered into the subcontract after it had hired incumbent elvis personnel at cost prohibitive rates  knowing that its actual costs would greatly exceed the subcontract s funding limitations 
under the complaint  swales is seeking damages in excess of million 
management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company

overview analex specializes in developing intelligence  system engineering and bio defense services in support of our nation s security 
all of our sales are generated using written contractual arrangements 
the contracts require us to deliver technical services to the intelligence community  analyze and support defense systems  design  develop and test aerospace systems according to the specifications provided by our customers 
in the case of abs  the contracts require us to develop medial defenses and treatments for infectious agents such as anthrax and smallpox used in biological warfare and terrorism 

table of contents sales to us federal government agencies and their prime contractors represented approximately of our total revenues during the twelve months ended december  and the department of defense accounted for approximately and of our revenues in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
with the acquisition of the former analex corporation in november  nasa became our largest customer  generating and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
approximately of our revenues and of our operating income for fiscal year came from one prime contract with an agency within the department of defense 
approximately of our revenues for fiscal year came from one prime contract with nasa  which has a potential nine year and four month contract term if all options are exercised 
we expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the source of substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in fiscal year  a majority of our revenues were generated as a prime contractor to the federal government 
we intend to focus on retaining and increasing the percentage of our business as prime contractor because it provides us with stronger client relationships 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenues for the following periods fiscal year prime contract revenues subcontract revenues total revenues we have two reportable segments analex  which is engaged in professional services related to information technology and systems engineering for the us government  primarily nasa and the department of defense  and advanced biosystems abs  which is engaged in biomedical research for medical defenses against toxic agents capable of being used as bioterrorist weapons  such as anthrax and smallpox 
the analex segment consists of two business groups the homeland security group and the systems engineering group 
the homeland security group provides information technology services  systems integration  hardware and software engineering and independent quality assurance in support of the us intelligence community and department of defense 
the systems engineering group provides engineering  information technology and program management support to nasa  the department of defense  and major aerospace contractors such as lockheed martin and northrop grumman 
the following table shows our revenues from each of these segments as a percentage of our total revenues for the past three years percent of revenues by segment analex segment homeland security group systems engineering group abs segment total our services are provided under three types of contracts cost plus fees  time and materials  and fixed price contracts 
cost plus fees contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs  to the extent prescribed in the contract  plus a profit component 
these contracts establish a ceiling amount that the contractor may not exceed without the approval of the contracting officer 
if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to recover those costs 

table of contents time and materials contracts provide for acquiring services on the basis of director labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates 
profit margins on time and materials contracts fluctuate based on the difference between negotiated billing rates and actual labor and overhead costs directly charged or allocated to such contracts 
we assume the risk that costs of performance may exceed the negotiated hourly rates 
fixed price contracts provide for delivery of products or services for a price that is negotiated in advance on the basis of the contractor s cost experiences 
the price is not subject to any adjustment and that means we assume the financial risk of cost overruns 
if the costs exceed the estimates  profit margins decrease and a loss may be realized on the contract 
the following table shows our revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenues for the past three years fiscal year cost plus fees time and materials fixed price total our objective is to grow sales organically and through acquisitions 
in order to assist in accomplishing this objective  we have continued to increase our sales  general and administrative expenditures so as to increase our efforts in new business development and to provide the necessary infrastructure to support rapid growth from organic growth and from acquisitions 
our abs segment  focusing on biodefense research  is dependent upon continued funding of its research efforts from various governmental agencies 
new sources of funding for abs have been identified  however  these new contracts are at a substantially decreased level of effort and shorter duration than our previous contracts 
at this time  we are uncertain of our ability to continue to obtain funding sources for abs 
management is exploring options for divestiture of abs 
in addition  one of our key strategies following the pequot transaction in december is to pursue growth through acquisitions 
we plan to selectively acquire companies that complement and enhance our existing businesses  and are currently reviewing potential targets 
we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing through sale of equity and debt securities to fund our acquisitions 
the company s backlog of orders  based on remaining contract value  believed to be firm as of december  was approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to the analex segment and million was attributable to abs 
the portion of the total backlog expected to be realized within is million 
funded backlog as of december  was approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to the abs segment 
we expect to consume all of the funded backlog during included in the backlog approximation are amounts from future years of government contracts under which the government has the right to exercise an option for the company to perform services 
all of our us government contracts are subject to audit and various cost controls  and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the us government 
multi year us government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable 

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies require significant management judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenues the company s contracts with the government are typically cost plus fee  time and materials  or fixed price contracts 
revenues result from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and from pass through of costs for material and work performed by subcontractors 
revenues on cost type contracts are recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
revenues for time and materials contracts are recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract defined billing rates  plus the cost of materials used in performance on the contract 
profits on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services 
revenues on certain fixed price service contracts are recorded each period based on a monthly amount for services provided 
revenues on other fixed price contracts are recorded as costs are incurred  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
in the normal course of business  the company may be party to claims and disputes resulting from modifications and change orders and other contract matters 
claims for additional contract compensation are recognized when realization is probable and estimable 
long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the company s related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly

series a preferred stock the company determined the initial carrying value of the series a preferred stock by a two step allocation process first to the preferred warrants  and second  to an embedded conversion option 
first the company allocated the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock between the series a preferred stock and the preferred warrants based on their relative fair values  which resulted in recording a discount on the series a preferred stock 
the value of the preferred warrants was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the preferred warrants were valued using the exercise price of pursuant to the pequot purchase agreement  the stock price as of the date of the date of the closing of  a risk free rate of  a volatility of  and an expected life of four years

table of contents this value was determined by calculating the number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock is convertible 
the value allocated to the series a preferred stock after value was allocated to the preferred warrants was then divided by the number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock is convertible 
the result   was then compared to the current fair value of  the company s stock price as of the closing date 
since the conversion price was less than the fair value as of the closing date  a beneficial conversion feature exists 
the difference between the conversion price and the fair value as of the closing date was multiplied by the total number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock is convertible 
the result was a beneficial conversion of approximately million 
the amount of the beneficial conversion was recorded as additional paid in capital  resulting in a further discount on the series a preferred stock

the  consideration to be paid under the stout non competition agreement was recognized as a liability as of the closing date and will be paid quarterly over the three year life of the agreement 
also  included in the stout repurchase agreement was the repurchase of certain warrants and stock options 
the company estimated the fair value of the warrants as of the closing date using a fair value option pricing model and determined that the amount the stout parties are receiving to purchase warrants is less than the fair value as of the closing date 
therefore  the company did not incur any additional compensation expense related to the purchase of the warrants

table of contents capital resources and liquidity the working capital at december  increased by approximately million from december   primarily due to cash provided by the pequot transaction along with the company s continued profitability 
proceeds of the pequot transaction were million  of which million was used to fund the activities pursuant to the stout repurchase agreement 
the working capital at december  increased by approximately million from december   primarily due to increased profitability generated by the company s purchase of the former analex corporation and the award of the elvis contract

in the twelve months ended december   the company recorded net income of million and ebitda of million  after add backs for interest of million  taxes of million  depreciation of million and amortization of million 
while we expect that the proceeds from the pequot transaction  the borrowing availability under our credit facility  together with cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs for normal operations for at least the next twelve months  we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing through sale of equity or debt securities to fund our acquisitions 
in the absence of acquisitions  given the substantial charges associated with the convertible notes and the series a preferred stock  it is possible that the company might need to renegotiate its covenants under its bank line of credit during in order the remain in compliance with the terms of its credit facility 
the company s expectation  however  is that acquisitions will be consummated and therefore  we do not consider it a material risk 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interests 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
if additional financing is raised through sale of our common stock  it may result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders 
in december  we sold to pequot million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
they are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries 
the convertible notes will mature on december  the indebtedness incurred with respect to the convertible notes is material in relation to our ability to service the debt from our operating cash flow and our ability to repay the debt in full at maturity 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet our operating needs  or to repay the convertible notes or to redeem the series a preferred stock in accordance with their respective terms 
our ability to repay the convertible notes at maturity may also be adversely affected by the right of the holders of the series a preferred stock to contemporaneously require the company to redeem their shares of series a preferred stock

our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement will be affected by our financial performance  our ability to complete an acquisition as well as events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
the breach of any of the covenants in our credit agreements could result in a default  which would permit bank of america to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be due and payable 
if we are unable to repay our indebtedness  bank of america could proceed against our accounts receivable and other assets which are the collateral securing the indebtedness

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks and hedging activities the company s outstanding bank debt bears interest at variable interest rates tied to libor 
the use of variable rate debt to finance operations and capital improvements exposes the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
the company uses an interest rate swap to reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations 
the company does not hold any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s million term loan facility from bank of america carries interest comprised of two components floating rate libor plus a credit performance margin 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america whereby its obligation to pay floating rate libor was swapped into a fixed rate obligation at beginning in january the company continues to have the obligation to pay the credit performance margin in addition to its swapped payment obligation

interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in other long term liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or in earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
over time  the unrealized gains losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized in earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings
