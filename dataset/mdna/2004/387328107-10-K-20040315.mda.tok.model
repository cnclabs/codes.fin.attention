item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and are engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
we have offices in california  washington  oregon  alaska  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  new york and utah 
our business involves two operating segments the branch division and the heavy construction division 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
the two primary economic drivers of our business are federal  state and local public funding levels and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and locally 
the level of demand for our services will have a direct correlation to these drivers 
for example  a weak economy will generally result in a reduced demand for construction in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for fewer private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on the scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
a weak economy also tends to produce less tax revenue to the public sector that can have the effect of decreasing the funds available for spending on infrastructure improvements 
there are funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as gasoline taxes  which are not necessarily directly impacted by a weak economy 
however  even these funds can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments struggle to balance their budgets 
greater competition can reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
conversely  higher public funding and or a robust economy will increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs may also vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign employees who had been working on projects to estimating and bidding activities until another project is ready to start  which temporarily moves their salaries and other related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the stock generally five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of increasing general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and decreasing expenses in less profitable years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  accounting for construction joint ventures  the valuation of long lived assets and insurance estimates 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 

table of contents revenue recognition for construction contracts the majority of our contracts with our customers are either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work profitably for the specified contract amount 
our design build projects are generally fixed price contracts and  primarily as a result of the growth in the design build business in the last several years  our revenue from design build contracts has been increasing 
all state and federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine what the estimated profit on the project will be with a reasonable level of assurance 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the threshold is applied to all percentage of completion projects without exception unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to produce materially reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have many projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time during we worked on over  projects these changes in estimates typically offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates  particularly in the bigger  more complex projects in our heavy construction division  can have a more significant effect on profitability 
factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability include  without limitation  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  the availability and proximity of materials  the accuracy of the original bid and subsequent estimates  inclement weather and timing and coordination issues inherent in all projects  including design build projects 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 

table of contents construction joint ventures as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project  is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners and is dissolved upon completion of the project 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of the prospective venturers construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project  however  if one of our partners was unable to pay its proportionate share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsoring partner in others 
consistent with industry practice and emerging issues task force issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures  we account for our share of the operations of jointly controlled ventures on a pro rata basis in the consolidated statements of income and as a single line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
if we were to account for these interests using a one line item equity method presentation in the consolidated statements of income  revenue and contract costs would be materially lower  however  net income would not change 
alternatively  if we were to account for these interests using full consolidation  assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet would be materially higher and revenue and contract costs in the consolidated statements of income would be materially higher  however  net income would not change 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we had approximately million in goodwill at december   primarily related to our acquisition of halmar builders of new york  inc in we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently when events and circumstances occur that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded using a discounted future cash flow method 
we then compare the resulting fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment test in and we determined that no impairment had occurred 
the discounted future cash flow method used in the first step of our impairment test involves significant estimates including future cash inflows from estimated revenues  future cash outflows from estimated project cost and general and administrative costs  estimates of timing of collection and payment of various items and future growth rates as well as discount rate and terminal value assumptions 
although we 
table of contents believe the estimates and assumptions that we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
insurance estimates we carry insurance policies to cover various risks  primarily general liability and workers compensation  under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid 
the amounts that we are liable for generally range from the first million to million per occurrence 
we accrue for the estimated ultimate liability for incurred losses  both reported and unreported  using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified  if necessary  by recent events 
changes in our loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would result in a change in our assessment of the ultimate liability that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
current year revenue years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent in thousands revenue by division branch division heavy construction division revenue by geographic area california west excluding california midwest south northeast revenue by market sector federal agencies state agencies local public agencies total public sector private sector material sales revenue revenue from our branch division decreased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  branch division revenue in included million from our majority owned wilder construction company wilder subsidiary  which was consolidated in our financial statements beginning in may  versus million in the decrease in branch division revenue reflects a decrease in construction revenue  primarily in the public sector  partially offset by the increase in wilder revenue referred to above and an increase in revenue from the sale of construction materials 
many of our branch division businesses have been impacted by the effects of a weaker general economy and uncertainty surrounding public funding  particularly in california see outlook 
the increase in revenue from construction materials is due to increases in both unit volume and average sales price of certain products  which we believe reflect an appreciation in the market for the growing scarcity of finite 
table of contents aggregate resources and the results of a strategic focus on maximizing revenue from external sales of materials 
revenue from our heavy construction division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  due primarily to results from a higher backlog at the beginning of geographically  this revenue growth came from projects in the south and from our granite halmar location in new york 
backlog december  amount percent amount percent in thousands backlog by division heavy construction division branch division backlog by geographic area california west excluding california midwest south northeast backlog by market sector federal agencies state agencies local public agencies total public sector private sector backlog backlog in our heavy construction division at december  was  million  an increase of million  or  from the december  level 
the increase took place primarily in the south and at our granite halmar location in new york and reflects increases in both public sector and private sector backlog 
additions to hcd backlog in the fourth quarter of included a million interchange project in florida  a million roadway and bridge project in florida and a million transit facility project in new york 
branch division backlog at december  was million  a decrease of million or from the december  level 
the decrease was due primarily to lower backlog in the public sector  particularly in california where the continuing budget crisis has had a negative impact on the amount of funding available for infrastructure projects 
branch division awards in the fourth quarter of include a million share of a joint venture highway improvement project in nevada and a million highway reconstruction project in utah 

table of contents gross profit years ended december  in thousands total gross profit percent of revenue gross profit as more fully described under critical accounting estimates we recognize revenue only equal to cost  deferring profit recognition  until a project reaches completion 
because we have a large number of projects at various stages of completion in our branch division  this policy generally has very little impact on the branch division s gross profit on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  hcd has fewer projects in process at any given time and those projects tend to be much larger than branch division projects 
as a result  hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary significantly in periods where one or several very large projects reach completion and the deferred profit is recognized or conversely  in periods where backlog is growing rapidly and a higher percentage of projects are in their early stages with no associated gross margin recognition 
additionally  as we also describe under critical accounting estimates we do not recognize revenue from contract claims until we have a signed agreement and payment is assured and we do not recognize revenue from contract change orders until the contract owner has agreed to the change order 
however  we do recognize the costs related to any contract claims or pending change orders when they are incurred 
as a result  our gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary during periods where a large volume of change orders or contract claims are pending resolution reducing gross profit percent or  conversely  during periods where large change orders or contract claims are agreed or settled increasing gross profit percent 
although this variability can occur in both our branch division and hcd  it can be much more pronounced in hcd because of the larger size of their projects 
revenue from projects that were less than complete was million in and million in because the variance between the two years was not significant  the impact on the comparability of gross profit as a percent of revenue between the two years was also not significant 
no significant claim revenue was recognized in either or gross profit as a percent of revenue in our branch division increased slightly in as compared with this was due to an increase in the profitability of sales of construction materials  partially offset by lower gross profit margin on the division s construction work 
construction gross margins in the branch division have been under pressure due to increased competition resulting from reductions in various state and local transportation funding programs  however the margins on the sale of materials have benefited from a higher average sales price 
gross profit as a percent of revenue in hcd decreased in as compared with due largely to profit forecasts on several projects that were revised downward to give recognition to additional estimated costs to complete for which we either do not expect to receive additional revenue or we have not yet reached agreement with the contract owner for additional revenue 

table of contents general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands salaries and related expenses incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation other general and administrative expenses total percent of revenue general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million from to this increase is primarily attributed to expenses from our wilder subsidiary and our expansion into northern california  both of which were first reflected in our costs in may excluding the wilder and northern california locations added in may of  salaries and related expenses increased by approximately million in incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation increased in as compared with due to higher net income in other general and administrative costs include information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expense 
operating income years ended december  in thousands branch division heavy construction division unallocated other corporate expenses total operating income our heavy construction division s contribution to operating income increased in compared with due primarily to increased revenue as described in revenue above 
branch division contribution to operating income decreased in compared with due to lower revenue as described in revenue above and higher general and administrative expenses due primarily to expenses from our wilder subsidiary and our expansion into northern california  both of which were first reflected in our costs in may unallocated other corporate expenses principally comprise corporate general and administrative expenses 
other income expense years ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense gain on sales of property and equipment equity in income of affiliates other  net total 
table of contents other income expense included in equity in income of affiliates in is million recognized in the first quarter of related to the sale of the state route toll road franchise by the california private transportation corporation cptc  of which we are a limited partner  as well as a gain of approximately million recognized on the sale of a portion of our investment in tic holdings  inc tic 
interest income decreased in  largely due to the absence of the recognition of deferred interest income on a note receivable from cptc in and lower look back interest income related to taxes paid on income from construction projects 
outlook while we are encouraged by our performance in  our optimism is guarded about the outlook for the year ahead 
certainly  there are challenges  as well as opportunities  for both divisions 
our short term challenges are primarily brought on by the fiscal crisis in california and the much anticipated reauthorization of a new federal highway bill 
our heavy construction division continues to grow in terms of revenue and operating income  and we believe the division is poised for another significant increase in operating earnings 
we are particularly optimistic about our granite halmar business in new york as its performance continues to improve 
hcd s bid list across the country in both transit and rail projects is large  allowing us to selectively bid the work available 
on the other hand  we have recently witnessed some projects being delayed as a result of funding uncertainties surrounding the size and timing of a new federal highway bill 
with respect to the branch division  the private sector market continues to be fairly active in many of the areas in which we operate 
strategically  we are working to more aggressively pursue this type of work  particularly site development and housing 
the private sector business is also a key driver for our aggregates business 
while it is still early in our season  we feel that our materials business will remain relatively strong 
in addition  we believe our quality control program and the ability to understand our customers issues from a contractor s viewpoint gives us a unique advantage over some of the pure materials suppliers 
on the political front in california  governor schwarzenegger recently proposed his mid year budget changes and his budget that  if passed in its current form  would dramatically reduce funding for transportation 
although it is unclear what the final outcome will be  there are still strong interests trying to secure additional transportation funding by borrowing against anticipated future revenues  or promoting other alternatives to the governor s proposed budget 
for example  the state s nonpartisan legislative analyst is urging lawmakers to reject the proposed funding cut  repeal proposition and support an additional cents per gallon increase to the gas tax to pay for transportation projects 
on march  california voters passed proposition  which authorizes the state to issue a bond of up to billion to help deal with its budget deficit 
there is some sentiment among both democrats and republicans to use as much as billion of the proceeds to repay the general fund obligations to transportation accounts of which a total of billion is owed 
revenues from actual state gas taxes  weight fees and federal funds are not part of the state s general fund and are consequently less vulnerable to the state s budget problem 
the california department of transportation caltrans recently announced that they will be allocating as much as million for transportation projects between late february and june   the end of the fiscal year 
over the last several months  caltrans withheld allocations for new projects due to cash flow concerns 
as a result of higher than anticipated federal funds and legislation that adjusted truck weight fees  these concerns have eased and  according to caltrans representatives  approximately billion will be available for transportation related projects during their fiscal year while we are encouraged by this information  it still too early to predict to what extent  if any  these allocations will have on the branch division this year 
in late february  the house and senate passed legislation to extend the federal highway and transit programs through april th  giving congress more time to finish work on a six year bill that would replace the previous legislation  the transportation equity act for the st century tea 
certainly  our long term outlook for new projects will be positively affected if an adequate federal highway bill is passed 
the combination of a senate bill passed on february th for billion and a billion bill proposed in the 
table of contents house of representatives provides evidence that congress will pass such a bill 
there appears to be strong sentiment in both houses and on both sides of the aisle to see funding levels for transportation significantly higher than the billion proposed by the bush administration 
however  president bush s administration has indicated that he will veto any bill that exceeds billion and has been steadfast against any increase in the federal gas tax as a mechanism to increase funding levels 
the administration s proposal amounts to a increase over the tea amount  while the senate version would provide a increase over the prior bill 
going forward  we remain focused on the successful execution of our backlog 
we believe that our employees  our unique business model and financial strength will enable us to successfully navigate through uncertain times 
we remain very encouraged about the short and long term prospects for hcd and our branches despite the current challenging environment in california 
we are confident that the on going need to maintain and replace our nation s infrastructure will provide us with opportunities to continue to grow our business 
prior years revenue total company revenue for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  by million  or 
branch division revenue in increased by million  or  and included million of revenue from our newly consolidated majority owned wilder construction company wilder subsidiary and million of revenue from the businesses acquired from robinson construction company and parnum paving  inc robinson and parnum see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the wilder  robinson and parnum revenue  branch division revenue for decreased compared with by million  or 
revenue was lower in many of our branch division s locations in compared to  with the most significant decreases in utah and california excluding parnum and robinson and decreases were experienced in both public and private sector revenue 
we believe the decreases were attributable to a general slowdown in private development projects and the related increased competitiveness in bidding for public sector projects due to a weak economic climate as well as a lower level of funding available for public sector projects in many of our locations 
revenue from our heavy construction division increased million  or  in the year ended december  over the year ended december  included in hcd revenue in was million of revenue from our new granite halmar location in new york 
the granite halmar business was acquired on july  and made its first revenue contribution in the third quarter of in addition to the impact of having our new york location for a full year in versus six months in  the increased hcd revenue in reflects larger volume from higher backlog at the beginning of revenue from the sale of materials in included million from wilder and the businesses acquired from parnum and robinson 
excluding this revenue  our revenue from the sale of materials increased million  or  in as compared with  due to the combined factors of higher unit selling prices and slightly higher volume in many of our locations 
backlog our backlog at december  of  million was million  or higher than our backlog at december  our backlog included million of backlog in our branch division from our newly consolidated wilder subsidiary and the businesses acquired from parnum and robinson 
the increased branch division backlog reflected higher backlog from public sector projects due primarily to its share of a million design build railroad project in nevada that is shared between our branch division and hcd as well as the contributions from wilder and the businesses acquired from parnum and robinson 
the increased backlog of public sector projects in our branch division at december  was partially offset by a million  or  decrease in branch division private sector backlog from december   which we believe was attributable to the impact of a slowdown in private development projects due to a relatively weak economic climate heavy construction division backlog increased from  million at december  to  million at december  the increase was largely due to higher backlog at our granite halmar 
table of contents location in new york and also reflected the high number of large  complex projects  including design build projects that were available to bid nationwide in hcd s awards in the fourth quarter of included three new projects for its granite halmar location in new york a million new york city transit project  a million amtrak project  and a million portion of a million subway reconstruction project joint venture 
although our backlog of projects in california grew slightly in compared with  it declined as a percentage of total backlog from in to in due to relatively greater increases in other parts of the west  primarily from wilder  and in the northeast at our granite halmar location in new york 
our backlog from local public agency projects at december  increased significantly from the amount at december   primarily because of the award of the million design build railroad project in nevada and the million new york city transit project during gross profit our gross profit as a percent of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   as a result of higher gross profit margins in hcd partially offset by slightly lower gross profit margins in our branch division 
the increase in hcd gross profit margin in was largely due to a generally more profitable mix of hcd projects compared to a year ago and the absence of a deterioration in margin of a non sponsored joint venture project on the east coast that we experienced in this increase was partially offset by the recognition of additional costs to complete several new york area projects that negatively impacted gross margin in the first and second quarters of additionally  both hcd and branch division gross profit margins were slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the amount of revenue recognized from projects that had not yet reached complete from million in to million in branch division gross profit margins were also impacted in by lower profitability on certain projects assumed in the acquisition of the parnum and robinson businesses as well as increased competition in a slower economic climate 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  subcontractor costs  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  our gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during general and administrative expenses salaries and related expenses increased in the year ended december  over due to increased staffing to support our current and expected growth  including approximately million in costs associated with the consolidation of wilder and our geographic expansion into northern california and approximately million resulting from the inclusion of the granite halmar location in new york for the entire year in versus only six months in additionally  salaries and related expenses increased in certain locations due to certain personnel normally charged to job cost being temporarily reassigned to general and administrative cost to bid new work while awaiting reassignment to another project 
incentive compensation increased in primarily due to higher operating income in our heavy construction division and the inclusion of wilder in the amount 
increases in other general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from costs associated with our continued growth  including costs associated with our expansion into northern california and new york as well as the inclusion of costs from the newly consolidated wilder subsidiary 
other general and administrative costs include information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expense 
operating income our heavy construction division s contribution to operating income increased in compared to due primarily to increased volume at a higher profit margin as described in revenue and gross profit above 
branch division operating income in included approximately million from our newly consolidated wilder subsidiary and our expansion into northern california and was lower in compared to primarily because of lower revenue and gross profit margins as described in revenue and gross profit above 
unallocated other corporate expenses principally comprises corporate general and administrative expenses 

table of contents other income expense other income decreased by million to million in compared with the decrease was due primarily to the absence of million recognized on the sale of excess and developed property in  lower gains on the sale of equipment and the impact of discontinuing recording the results of tic holdings  inc tic and wilder in other income under the equity method of accounting during the second quarter of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our interest income was negatively impacted by lower interest rates on our investments in offset by the recognition of deferred interest income on a note receivable from the california private transportation company  lp when collectibility became assured in the fourth quarter of and recognition of look back interest income related to taxes paid in previous years on income from certain construction projects 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in from in due to the combined factors of higher percentage depletion deductions related to quarry properties and higher tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  acquisitions and other investments 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next months and beyond 
if we experience a significant change in our business such as the execution of a significant acquisition  we would likely need to acquire additional sources of financing 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  represents a million decrease from the amount provided by operating activities in this decrease is primarily due to the combined factors of higher growth in accounts receivable partially offset by higher growth in accounts payable and growth in our equity in construction joint ventures as well as cash of approximately million used to purchase and develop properties held for sale 
the growth in accounts receivable and accounts payable was due to higher revenue particularly in the fourth quarter 
the increase in our equity in construction joint ventures in was due to both an increase in the number of projects we are performing in joint venture and the progress on joint venture projects that were newly awarded in late cash used by investing activities of million in represents a million decrease from the amount used in investing activities in the decrease was largely due to cash received from the sale of the state route toll road franchise by cptc  the absence of cash expended for acquisitions of businesses in and lower net purchases of marketable securities 

table of contents cash used by financing activities was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was mainly due to lower net repayments of long term debt by our wilder subsidiary and the absence of cash expended to repurchase our common stock in  partially offset by increased cash dividends paid to stockholders and the absence of proceeds from the exercise of warrants in the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations outstanding as of december  in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations under construction contracts other purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations wilder stock repurchase obligation total see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
these obligations represent our best estimate of future purchases of materials and subcontract services related to our current contract backlog 
these obligations represent firm purchase commitments for equipment and other goods and services not connected with our construction backlog which are individually greater than thousand and have an expected purchase after february  the years of expected payment of deferred compensation are based on estimates and are subject to change 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the years of expected payment for redemptions are based on estimates and are subject to change 
in  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock of which million remained at december  in addition  we are authorized to purchase shares for contribution to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
in february   shares were repurchased for a total purchase price of million and were contributed to the esop 
we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire during additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are generally released from the bonds when each contract is accepted by the owner 
the ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties 
as described under critical accounting estimates above  we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships 
under the joint ventures contracts with the project owners each of the partners are joint and severally liable for performance under the contracts 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its proportionate share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements 
table of contents include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december  approximately million of work representing either our partners proportionate share or work that our partners are directly responsible for  had yet to be completed 
we have never incurred a loss under these joint and several liability provisions  however it is possible that we could in the future and such a loss could be significant 
in addition to our working capital and cash generated from operations  we currently have access to funds under a million bank revolving line of credit  which allows for unsecured borrowings for up to three years through june   with interest rate options

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks due largely to changes in interest rates  which we have managed primarily by managing the maturities in our investment portfolio 
we currently do not transact business in foreign currencies 
the fair value of our short term held to maturity investment portfolio and related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the fair value of our long term held to maturity investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
our mutual fund portfolio of million is exposed to equity price risks 
we had senior notes payable of million at december  which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in and senior notes payable of million at december  which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments beginning in in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in order to gain access to the lower borrowing rates normally available on floating rate debt  while avoiding the prepayment and other costs that would be associated with refinancing our long term fixed rate debt 
the swaps purchased have a combined notional amount of million  a thirty month term with six month settlement periods and provide for us to pay variable interest at libor plus set rate spreads and receive fixed interest of between and 
the notional amount does not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but rather  is used in the determination of cash settlement under the swap agreement 
as a result of purchasing these swaps  we are exposed to credit losses from any counter party non performance  however  we do not anticipate any such losses from these agreements  which are with a major financial institution 
the agreements will also expose us to interest rate risk should libor rise during the term of the agreements 
these swap agreements are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  we initially recorded the interest rate swaps at fair value  and subsequently recorded any changes in fair value in other income  net 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices  which reflect the difference between estimated future variable rate payments and future fixed rate receipts 

table of contents the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  held to maturity investments and significant debt obligations in thousands thereafter total assets cash  cash equivalents and held to maturity investments weighted average interest rate liabilities fixed rate debt senior notes payable weighted average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term held to maturity investments approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the generally short maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our long term held to maturity investments approximates the principal amounts above due to the relatively minor change in interest rates since their date of purchase 
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt 
based on the lower fixed borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the senior notes payable was approximately million as of december  and million as of december
