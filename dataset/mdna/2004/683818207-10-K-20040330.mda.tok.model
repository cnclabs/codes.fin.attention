actual results could differ from those projected in any forward looking statements for the reasons  among others  detailed under risk factors in this report on form k 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to optelecom s past filings means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we compete and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
the forward looking statements are made as of the date of this form k and we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements  or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
fluctuations in financial performance optelecom has experienced and may  in the future  continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results 
factors that may cause operating results to vary include  but are not limited to  changing technology  new product transitions  delays in new product introductions  competition  shortages of system components  changes in the mix of products and services sold and timing of investments in additional personnel  facilities and research and development 
as a result of the impact of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of the future performance in any particular fiscal period 
we are somewhat limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
therefore  optelecom s business  financial condition  and operating results could be adversely affected if increased revenues are not achieved 
dependence on major customers for the twelve months ended december  approximately of our revenues were accounted for by sales to five commercial customers 
this is a decline from the prior year when five customers represented of our revenues 
in the event of a reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers or if one or more significant customers selects products from one of our competitors for inclusion in future product generations  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that optelecom s current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
the loss of one or more of our current significant customers could materially and adversely affect optelecom s business  financial condition and operating results 
technological change optelecom s products are sold in markets that are subject to rapid technological change 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing such products or producing enhancements that meet these changing demands  that optelecom will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner or our failure to achieve market acceptance of a new product could have a material adverse effect on optelecom 
competition we face intense and increasing competition from a large number of competitors  some of which are larger than optelecom and have larger product development  research and sales staffs 
we believe that the products developed in and and the products currently being developed will position us to compete effectively through and well into there can be no assurance  however  that our competitors will not develop products that are as  or possibly more  effective than ours 
we continuously monitor our competitors product introductions to evaluate our ability to compete 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding optelecom believes that our existing capital resources  including an existing  bank line of credit and future operating cash flows  will generate the funds needed for our long term cash requirements 
if our growth rate should exceed expectations  or if we should fail to generate the anticipated operating cash flows  optelecom would be required to seek additional funding 
in those circumstances  the company would look to increase its line of credit and or pursue equity financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
if issuing equity securities raises additional funds  further dilution to existing stockholders will result 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate product research and development and overhead costs 
need to attract and retain key employees optelecom is substantially dependent on the business and technical expertise of our senior management and on our ability to attract and retain key management and technical employees 
the loss of members of senior management or of other key employees or our inability to attract and retain other employees with necessary business or technical skills in the future would have a material adverse effect on optelecom s business 
price volatility in public market optelecom s common stock currently trades on the nasdaq small cap market 
the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to our operating performance 
in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded technology companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
announcements of technological innovations or new products of optelecom or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  publicity regarding products under development by optelecom or our competitors  regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries  and economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations in our operating and product development results  may have a significant impact on the market price of optelecom s common stock 
absence of dividends  dilution optelecom has not paid any cash dividends since our inception and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
dilution will occur upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and may occur upon future equity financing that could be required to fund operations

this lease expires in june  and the premises are in good repair  and are adequate for current requirements 
item legal proceedings from time to time  optelecom is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
as of the date of this report optelecom is not a party to any litigation or other legal proceeding that  in the opinion of management  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

over the past two years the company has aggressively pursued several operational objectives including the expansion of a distribution network both in the united states and abroad  realization of manufacturing and process improvements and implementation of a cost and asset management program 
the successful execution of these initiatives along with increased demand in our core markets has enabled the company to significantly improve its financial condition in and  as evidenced by increasing levels of profitability and positive cash flow 
in the fourth quarter of the company determined that its deferred tax assets  comprised mainly of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  were more likely to be realized than not 
as a result  the company reversed its deferred tax valuation allowance and recognized a one time non cash tax benefit of million 
the company will begin recognizing tax provisions in the company will continue in to work at broadening its sales channels  sustaining gross profit margins and controlling costs

electro optics revenues increased to million in from million in as a result of expansion of the contract services and the coil winding businesses 
gross profit was million in compared to million in this increase of million is primarily the result of a higher volume of sales of digital and data communications products in  which had higher profit margins in compared to as a result of continued improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in material costs over the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  our gross margin remained constant with our gross margin at 
the company expects margins in to be comparable to operating expenses were million in compared to million in this increase of million or is primarily due to increases in spending for engineering personnel  sales advertising and trade show costs and higher occupancy costs as a result of the company s move to a larger and expanded facility early in as a percentage of revenue our operating expenses declined from in to in as our revenue increases we are experiencing a reduction in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
in our operating expense as a percent of revenue was 
the company reported net income in of million or per diluted share compared to net income of million or per diluted share in the company s net income includes a million tax benefit due to the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the company based its decision to reverse the deferred tax valuation allowance on the consistently strong profit performance over the last two and one half years  along with our expectation of continued future profitability 
the company will begin to recognize tax expense in versus consolidated revenues of million were million or higher than sales increased in the optical products and electro optics units and were lower in the copper products unit 
revenue for the optical products unit increased by million or 
this increase is attributed to the company s focus of increasing sales channels both domestically and internationally

electro optics revenues increased to million in from million in as a result of expansion of the contract research and development services and the coil winding business 
revenue for the copper products unit decreased by million or as the company began to shift its sales focus from copper based products to fiber based products 
gross profit was million in compared to million in this increase of million is primarily the result of a higher volume of sales of digital and high resolution products in  which have higher profit margins 
additionally  there was a higher level of sales of lower margin copper products in the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  our gross margin improved to from our gross margin of operating expenses were million in compared to million in this decrease of million or is primarily due to reductions in spending for engineering personnel  engineering consultants and lower corporate staff expense as a result of the restructuring of the copper products unit 
the principal purpose of this restructuring was to relocate key administrative functionality from europe to the us operations 
these reductions in spending were partially offset by higher selling personnel costs and the increased commissions necessary to support higher sales levels 
the company reported net income in of million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per share in there was a modest provision for state income tax in compared to no provision in the company is currently not paying federal income tax due to the net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
operating segments optelecom s products and services are categorized into two operating segments the communication products division and the electro optics technology unit 
prior to  the company had been reporting the revenues and expenses of the copper products unit separately 
during management decided to combine the copper products unit and the optical products into the communication products division in order to manage the business more effectively 
the financial results for the two operating segments have been prepared on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which optelecom management internally evaluates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
in this regard  certain common expenses have been allocated among segments differently than would be required for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
communication products division communication products division net sales gross profit total operating expense operating income loss sales for communication products division of million were or million higher than s sales of million 
this increase is attributed to the company s focus of increasing sales channels both domestically and internationally 
sales to integrators and distributors increased substantially over the prior year 
in the communication products division continued to experience the benefits of the expansion and re alignment of its sales and marketing departments 
the emphasis that was placed on developing new sales and distribution channels  both domestically and internationally resulted in higher sales in during  seven independent sales representative organizations and forty seven integrators were added domestically and seven integrators were added in the international marketplace 
the company expects to continue to add independent sales representative organizations and integrators both domestically and internationally in gross profit during of million  or of sales  was higher than s gross profit of million or of sales 
the increase of million is primarily the result of the higher volume of sales of digital and data communications products in the slight decline in gross profit margin in is mainly attributable to significantly lower margins on a large installation for the upcoming olympics in athens 
management determined that the benefit of having our technology showcased at this premier venue provided exposure to a level of potential customers that could not be easily reached otherwise 
the company expects margins in to be comparable to operating expenses were million in compared to million in sales and marketing costs increased million over  primarily due to higher advertising and trade show costs 
engineering costs increased million  primarily due to higher staff costs in general and administrative costs increased million from million in to million in cost increases are primarily attributed to the increases in personnel and occupancy costs as a result of locating to larger facilities early in and increased sales levels 
electro optics technology unit net sales gross profit total operating expense operating income electro optics sales of million in were million higher than the increase is primarily attributable to the increased unit sales of the coil winding division and higher sales under the contract research and development portion of the business in when compared to operating income for improved slightly as compared to primarily due to higher sales levels

impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the operations of the company during  and we do not expect it to have a significant effect during financial condition the company s stockholders equity increased from million in to million in the net income and consequent decrease in accumulated deficit of million was accompanied by an increase of million in common stock and paid in capital  due to the exercise of stock options and purchase of shares pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
other key components of optelecom s financial condition include accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets and accounts payable 
the company s current ratio has increased to at december  compared to at december  this increase is attributed primarily to the increase in cash from million to million  the increase in the current deferred tax asset to million and the million decrease in the company s bank line of credit 
accounts receivable decreased this year from million in to million at december  a significant factor in this decrease was relatively large shipments late in inventory increased slightly from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to increases in production materials and work in process inventories 
these increases were due to the company s decision to increase stocking levels to meet customer requirements  primarily for the growing security and surveillance market 
during the year ended december   as a result of the lessening of exposure to component shortages  we were able to focus on stocking material at subassembly and finished good levels 
this resulted in our ability to service our customer s requirements in less time while benefiting from lower investment in overall inventories

during  as the company s profitability continued to improve  capital spending was increased in order to improve and expand on engineering and factory capabilities 
while the company does not currently have any capital asset purchase commitments  we anticipate an investment in capital expenditures of approximately million in the company s current liabilities decreased million from million in to million in primarily as a result of a decrease of million in the bank line of credit payable and million in other current liabilities 
accounts payable increased only slightly by million from to during the company incurred short term note indebtedness of million as a result of purchasing new capital equipment under a financing arrangement 
likewise  long term debt was increased by million as a result of purchasing new capital equipment under a financing arrangement

additionally  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and common stock issued from the employee stock purchase plan totaled million during under its current banking facility  the company has the ability to borrow up to million under its existing bank line of credit as of december   provided there are sufficient accounts receivable and inventory 
this facility consists of two components a a demand working capital line of credit which will enable the company to borrow up to the lesser of million or the borrowing base  and b a  transaction specific revolving demand export line of credit for short term financing 
the amount available will be the lesser of  or the borrowing base 
the company s borrowing base under the first facility equals the sum of of eligible government billed accounts receivable  of the eligible commercial billed accounts receivable and of eligible related inventory capped at  the company s borrowing base under the second facility equals the sum of of the eligible export related inventory and of the eligible export related accounts receivable

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
fin also requires disclosures about unconsolidated variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a significant variable interest 
application of fin  as revised in december  is required for financial statements of public entities that have interest in variable interest entities  or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public companies for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which changes the accounting for mandatorily redeemable shares  put options  forward purchase contracts and obligations that can be settled with shares effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  as the company does not have any of these types of instruments outstanding  the adoption of this statement did not have any impact upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act expands medicare  primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligibles starting in the act provides employers currently sponsoring prescription drug programs for medicare eligibles with a range of options for coordinating with the new government sponsored program to potentially reduce program cost 
the fsp concludes that companies will be permitted to recognize that amount for year end financial statements pursuant to fas or to delay having to report the effects of the act until remaining questions are resolved 
management does not believe the adoption of this statement will have any impact upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies optelecom s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon optelecom s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires optelecom to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  optelecom evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
optelecom bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  inventory  stock based compensation and income taxes to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue from commercial sales is recognized when product is shipped and accepted 
revenues from fixed price contracts  such as contracts from the government  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
optelecom follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revenues from time and materials contracts are recorded at the contract rates times the labor hours plus other direct costs as incurred 
in the ordinary course of business  the company warrants its products against defect in design  materials  and workmanship over various time periods 
warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is established based upon management s best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
beginning december  the company established a warranty reserve for expenses associated with future warranty claims 
this reserve is updated on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts optelecom maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer such as collection history and the results of credit inquiries 
if the financial condition of optelecom s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories production materials are valued at the lower of cost or market applied on a standard cost basis 
work in process represents direct labor  materials  and overhead incurred on products not delivered to date 
finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standards that approximate actual costs on a specific identification basis 
optelecom writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions as well as historical inventory turnover 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
for the reasons cited below  at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
the company has used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
approximately million of future taxable income predominately us ultimately is needed to realize the net deferred tax assets at december  failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  the following increased competition  a decline in sales or margins  loss of market share  delays in product availability or technological obsolescence 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company has not purchased any futures contracts nor purchased or held any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during the twelve months ended december  and the primary market risk exposure is the risk that interest rates on our outstanding borrowings may increase 
optelecom also faces market risk exposure as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments of the company s foreign subsidiary  paragon 
the company believes this risk is immaterial 
optelecom currently has no bank line of credit with aggregate maximum borrowings 
optelecom has not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to any prior interest obligations under these lines of credit 
certain risks of foreign operations in december  optelecom purchased oel formerly paragon audio visual  which operates primarily in countries outside the united states and is subject to certain risks such as currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurances that these factors will not have an adverse impact on our future international sales or operating results 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore may be exposed to possible losses on international transactions
