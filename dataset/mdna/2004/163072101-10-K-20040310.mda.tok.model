item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto found elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of march   we operated upscale  high volume  casual dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark 
we also operated three upscale casual dining restaurants under the grand lux cafe mark in los angeles  california  chicago  illinois and las vegas  nevada  one self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment center in orlando  florida  and a bakery production facility 
we also licensed three limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenue from our gift cards also known as stored value cards is recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  all outstanding balances on such cards are included as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors is recognized when the products are shipped 
sales and cost of sales are reported separately for restaurant and bakery activities 
all other operating cost and expense categories are reported on a combined basis for both restaurant and bakery activities 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present  in all material respects  our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
new restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales comparison in their nineteenth month of operation 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks and will end on december  our next week fiscal year will occur in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statements of operations of the company expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year revenues restaurant sales bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors total revenues costs and expenses restaurant cost of sales bakery cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million for fiscal consisted of the following components million from the openings of fourteen new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened prior to fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total estimated productive square feet and restaurant operating weeks increased approximately and to  and  respectively  during fiscal a single restaurant open during the full period of fiscal would have generated operating weeks 
productive square feet consists of interior plus seasonally adjusted patio square feet 
we believe that measuring the changes in total restaurant operating weeks and total productive square feet from period to period is the most effective way to analyze the growth of the total productive capacity of our restaurant operations 
average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year decreased slightly to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this slight decrease was principally due to severe weather throughout much of the country during the first six months of the year that resulted in approximately lost days of restaurant sales due to restaurant closings and reduced availability of our outdoor patio seats 
in addition  several of our newer restaurants experienced expected sales decreases to their sustainable run rate levels after their honeymoon opening period 
refer to part i business new restaurant sales and investment characteristics in this annual report on form k 
the average sales per week statistic for any period can also be impacted by the absolute size and productive capacity of new restaurants opened and the number of restaurants opened for new concepts such as grand lux cafe that  by definition  could initially be less productive than our established cheesecake factory concept 
comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal and our effective price increase for the full fiscal year was approximately 
comparable restaurant sales were impacted by the severe weather during the first six months of the year 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales productivity per productive square foot of approximately for fiscal  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases 
we presently update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
for cheesecake factory restaurants  these updates generally occur during january february the winter menu change and july august the summer menu change 
for our winter menu change  we are implementing an approximate effective menu price increase for the purpose of offsetting those operating cost and expense increases that are known or expected as of march  we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  holidays  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors referenced in this annual report on form k can impact comparable sales comparisons 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
during the first half of fiscal  bakery sales were unusually high principally as a result of the initial inventory pipeline fills for new relationships with the largest warehouse club operator and a national retailer 
in addition  a former large account foodservice industry customer discontinued purchasing our product in the third quarter of fiscal following a voluntary product withdrawal and recall 
while our bakery operations have requalified to do business with this customer  purchase activity has not yet resumed 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs increased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the menu at our restaurants is one of the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  is not overly dependent on a single commodity 
changes in costs for one commodity are often  but not always  counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include fresh produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other fresh dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
compared to the prior fiscal year  we experienced increased costs for fresh poultry  fish and certain meat related commodities during fiscal higher costs for these commodities were partially offset by lower costs for other commodities  such as shrimp and many general grocery items  coupled with increased volume purchase discounts and purchasing power as a result of our continued growth 
we are currently able to contract for approximately two thirds of the food commodities used in our restaurant operations for periods up to one year 
approximately one third of our restaurant cost of sales consists of fresh produce  poultry  fish  meat and dairy commodities that are not currently contractible for periods longer than days in most cases 
as a result  these fresh commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other general agricultural conditions 
for fiscal  we currently expect generally flat costs for our grocery and domestic cheese commodities  lower costs for our shrimp and shellfish commodities  and higher costs for our beef commodities 
based on current and expected market conditions for our non contractible commodities  we also expect higher costs for our fresh poultry and fish commodities and generally flat costs for our produce commodities 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected menu price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
while we have been successful in the past to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no absolute assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales  which include ingredient  packaging and production supply costs  were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease of million was principally attributable to the decrease in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales remained relatively unchanged at for fiscal compared to for fiscal while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our bakery or restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions beyond our control 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement for as much as million pounds during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we executed agreements for substantially all of our cream cheese requirements for the month period thereafter with two suppliers at a fixed cost per pound that is slightly higher than the actual cost per pound in fiscal we may also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting the reverse leverage during the first three months of fiscal from less than expected restaurant and bakery sales on the fixed portion of labor costs in both operations 
additionally  the unpredictable fluctuations in restaurant sales due to the severe winter weather during the first quarter of fiscal made it difficult for our restaurant operators to adjust hourly labor accordingly 
labor expenses were also impacted by increased costs for employee health insurance benefits 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses and taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal after excluding costs and expenses associated with the august bakery product withdrawal of approximately million or of total revenues included in the prior year amounts 
this increase was due primarily to increased costs for natural gas and electric services to our restaurants amounting to approximately basis points of total revenues  higher costs for our insurance arrangements of approximately basis points and increased selling  distribution and promotional costs related to our outside bakery sales 
based on current conditions in the energy markets  we currently expect the costs for our natural gas and electric services to continue to increase during fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  the restaurant field supervision organization  the bakery administrative organization and the corporate support organization 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year as the increase in these expenses for fiscal was less than the increase in total revenues for the year 
during fiscal  we plan to continue to add resources to the corporate support  training and field supervision activities of our business  commensurate with the planned openings of as many as new restaurants during the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened fourteen restaurants during fiscal compared to twelve openings during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the restaurant preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
the preopening costs for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  and costs for practice service activities 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to open each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in construction and or obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which may also be caused by landlord delays 
our direct preopening costs for an  square foot  single story restaurant in an established company market averages approximately  there will also be other preopening costs associated with each restaurant opening  including costs for corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs will usually be higher for larger restaurants  our initial entry into new markets and for new concepts such as grand lux cafe 
we usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs for a typical restaurant opening within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of the restaurant s opening 
preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant  and the fluctuations could be significant 
we expense preopening costs as incurred 
based on our current growth objectives for fiscal and  preopening costs for each of those years will likely exceed the respective amount of preopening costs for the applicable prior year 
interest income  other income and income taxes interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower yields on our interest bearing cash and short term investments that  in turn  was attributable to the decline in the general level of interest rates during fiscal we generally invest our excess cash balances in us treasury and agency securities  investment grade corporate debt securities rated a or better and money market mutual funds 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher gains on the sales of investments and marketable securities that were liquidated from time to time to fund the company s working capital requirements throughout the year 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  we currently estimate our effective tax rate to remain at 
the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pretax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million for fiscal consisted of the following components million from the openings of twelve new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened prior to fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total estimated productive square feet and restaurant operating weeks increased approximately and to  and  respectively  during fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year decreased slightly to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this slight decrease was principally due to sales for several of our newer restaurants that experienced expected sales decreases to their sustainable run rate levels after their honeymoon opening period 
refer to part i business new restaurant sales and investment characteristics in this annual report on form k 
comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal this increase was due almost entirely to effective menu price increases totaling approximately for the full fiscal year 
bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in bakery sales was principally attributable to higher sales volumes to new and established foodservice accounts and to warehouse club operators 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal despite the increase in bakery sales for the full year  bakery sales during the second half of fiscal were impacted by a voluntary withdrawal and recall of bakery products that were produced in the company s bakery production facility during a four day period in july due to possible bacteria contamination 
costs and expenses associated with the product withdrawal and recall are reflected in the other operating expenses category 
as a result of the product withdrawal and recall  bakery sales of approximately million that had been recorded prior to the product withdrawal and recall were reversed  and a large account foodservice industry customer discontinued purchasing our products 
restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  principally as a result of lower market prices in general for most of the food commodities used in our restaurants  coupled with increased volume purchase discounts that result from our increasing purchasing power 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the mix of sales to products with slightly lower cost of sales as a percentage of their associated price but with slightly higher selling expenses  which are included in the other operating costs and expenses category 
labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting increased costs for employee health insurance benefits and slightly higher labor costs for our two newest grand lux cafe locations  partially offset by labor productivity improvements 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as well as costs and expenses related to the bakery product withdrawal 
as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal costs and expenses associated with the bakery product withdrawal were approximately million or of total revenues 
other operating expenses were also impacted by higher costs for our insurance arrangements  which increased approximately as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year as the increase in these expenses for fiscal was less than the increase in total revenues for the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened twelve restaurants during fiscal compared to nine openings during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
interest income  other income expense  net and income taxes interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower yields on our interest bearing cash and short term investments that  in turn  was attributable to the decline in the general level of interest rates during fiscal other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher gains on the sales of investments and marketable securities in order to fund the company s working capital requirements 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our corporate finance strategy is to maintain a strong  conservative balance sheet in order to support our growth plan with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery operations  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations on a much larger scale 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan 
similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for substantially all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants  further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures  and maintain and expand our bakery production capacity 
in the past  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the company s key liquidity measurements 
fiscal year dollar amounts in millions cash and marketable securities on hand  end of year net working capital  end of year adjusted net working capital  end of year current ratio  end of year adjusted current ratio  end of year long term debt  end of year cash provided by operations capital expenditures includes all marketable securities classified as either current assets million  million and million for fiscal year  and  respectively or noncurrent assets million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million as of december  this increase was principally due to increased cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in the table above  we also present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations provide investors with useful information regarding our overall liquidity position because all marketable securities are readily available to meet our liquidity requirements 
we continue to target a weighted average maturity for our marketable securities investment portfolio between one and two years 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our investments are classified as noncurrent assets  but remain available for our liquidity requirements 
effective december   we amended and extended our revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
the credit facility was increased to million from million and expires on december  as of march   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
million of the credit facility has been reserved to support standby letters of credit for our self insurance programs 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus  or the applicable libor rate plus 
upon expiration of the credit facility  a maximum of million of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility automatically convert into a four year term loan  payable in equal quarterly installments at interest rates of higher than the applicable revolving credit rates 
the credit facility is not collateralized and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to observe certain restrictive covenants with respect to the conduct of our operations  with which we are currently in compliance 
our new restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example our share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased premises 
we may also disburse cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we initially record uncollected landlord construction contributions as other receivables 
our balance of other receivables will fluctuate from period to period  depending on the timing of cash collections from landlords and additional receivables recorded from new restaurant development activities 
see note  other receivables to our consolidated financial statements 
in the future  we may also develop more freestanding restaurant locations using both ground leases and built to suit leases  which are common arrangements used to finance freestanding locations in the restaurant industry 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with secured financing 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
during fiscal  our cash outlays and accrued liability for capital expenditures were approximately million 
of that amount  approximately million was related to new restaurant openings including several restaurants under development as of december  
the remainder consisted of approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition outlays for our existing restaurants and approximately million for bakery and corporate capital expenditures 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between and million  net of agreed upon landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this estimate contemplates a net outlay of million for as many as new restaurants to be opened during fiscal  estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and estimated collections of tenant improvement allowances from landlords 
this estimate also contemplates that two of our planned openings for fiscal do not have any landlord construction contributions 
not every potential location that we seek to develop into a restaurant may have landlord construction contributions available  and we would therefore not generally incur a contingent rent obligation on such locations 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants  and million for additional bakery capacity and corporate infrastructure investments 
in october  we entered into a year lease for approximately one half of an  square foot office building that is located adjacent to our existing corporate center and bakery production facility 
we currently utilize this leased space for our culinary r d kitchen  management training and other essential operational support activities 
in light of our expansion plans and our eventual need for additional staff to support our restaurant and bakery operations  we are evaluating a potential purchase of that entire office building to ensure the long term availability of expansion space 
if consummated  such a purchase would require a capital expenditure of approximately million and would be initially funded from our cash and investments balances on hand 
we may seek to obtain long term mortgage financing for such a purchase 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  combined with expected cash flow provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us 
during fiscal  our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock for reissuance upon the exercise of stock options under our current stock option plans 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
under this authorization  we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of million through december  our share repurchase agreement does not require us to repurchase any common stock and may be discontinued at any time 
as of march   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  amounts in millions contractual obligations total after operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum rent based on a percentage of sales ranging from to and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
amounts represent noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the primary lease terms of the respective leases 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgments by management 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we initially record landlord construction contributions as other receivables and reduce those receivables when cash is collected 
while we are not aware of any pending authoritative changes in accounting for leases in general  any such changes in the future could have an impact on the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee health benefit  workers compensation and general liability programs 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit its total exposure for each of these programs 
the accrued liability associated with these programs is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we will update our estimates  which  in turn  could result in an adjustment to our effective tax rate 
we usually file our income tax returns many months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued after may this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for substantially all of our fresh commodities such as produce  poultry  meat  fish and dairy items for long periods of time and  consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage  which increased in   and proposals are currently pending in congress to again increase the federal minimum wage 
several state and local governments have recently increased the minimum wage within their jurisdiction and others are presently considering such increases 
the state of california  where we currently operate approximately one fifth of our restaurants  increased its minimum wage by per hour to in january  and by another per hour to in january additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while the company has been able to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for its menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
we cannot guarantee that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income for our established restaurants have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
over one half of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating for all restaurants open as of march  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
holidays  severe winter weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal   and fiscal through march  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus or libor plus 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   we held million in available for sale marketable securities 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flows until the securities were disposed of 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for substantially all of our fresh commodities such as produce  poultry  fish and dairy items for periods longer than days 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
