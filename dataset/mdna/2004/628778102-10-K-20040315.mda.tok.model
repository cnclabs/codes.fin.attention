collectively  the registrant and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as the company 
net interest margin is presented in this discussion on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
average balances discussed are daily averages unless otherwise described 
the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with this review 
amounts in prior period consolidated financial statements are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the presentation 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions  in the application of certain accounting policies  about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
different amounts could be reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions were used in the application of these accounting policies 
the business of the company is providing commercial banking and financial services through its subsidiaries 
the company s primary market area is central and upstate new york and northeastern pennsylvania 
the company has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services 
the company s principle business is attracting deposits from customers within its market area and investing those funds primarily in loans and leases  and  to a lesser extent  in marketable securities 
the financial condition and operating results of the company are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on its earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily consisting of deposits and borrowings 
net income is also affected by provisions for loan and lease losses and noninterest income  such as service charges on deposit accounts  broker dealer fees  trust fees  and gains losses annual report nbt bancorp inc 
on securities sales  it is also impacted by noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  data processing  communications  occupancy  and equipment 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards  and actions of regulatory agencies 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations  or government policies may have a material impact on the company 
lending activities are substantially influenced by the demand for and supply of housing  competition among lenders  the level of interest rates  the state of the local and regional economy  and the availability of funds 
the ability to gather deposits and the cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market interest rates  fees and terms on deposit products  as well as the availability of alternative investments including mutual funds and stocks 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan and lease loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions significantly deteriorated  additional provisions for loan and lease losses would be required to increase the allowance 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s nonperforming loans and potential problem loans has a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
while management has concluded that the current evaluation of collateral values is reasonable under the circumstances  if collateral values were significantly lowered  the company s allowance for loan and lease policy would also require additional provisions for loan and lease losses 
the company s policy on the allowance for loan and lease losses is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan and lease losses is included in the risk management section of this form k 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  the company encourages the reader to review each of the policies included in note to obtain a better understanding on how the company s financial performance is reported

overview the company had net income of million or per diluted share for  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for there were several factors driving the improvement in results in compared to noninterest income increased million or in compared to this increase resulted from strong growth in service charges on deposit accounts and increases from trust revenue  broker dealer fees  bank owned life insurance boli income  and other income 
offsetting this increase in noninterest income was a decrease in net interest income of million and an increase in noninterest expenses of million 
the decrease in net interest income was driven primarily by the decrease in the company s net interest margin  which declined from for to for  primarily as a result of continued low market interest rates 
the decline in margin was offset somewhat by growth in average earning assets of driven primarily by loan growth 
average loans and leases increased in or million compared to average loans 
the increase in noninterest expense resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  and other noninterest expense offset by decreases in professional fees and outside services and loan collection and other real estate owned oreo expenses 
the provision for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged in from  as improvements in credit quality were offset by loan growth in the company had net income of million or per diluted share for  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for the improvement in results over was due to several factors 
there was a million decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses when compared to the same period in the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses was due mainly to an increase in nonperforming loans and charge offs during  resulting mainly from the process of integrating loans from recently acquired banks and weakening business conditions 
the net interest margin improved during  resulting in a million increase in net interest income over noninterest income was up million for when compared to driving this increase was a decrease in net securities losses of million in when compared to  due to the sale and writedown of several high risk securities previously held by cnb during additionally  growth in noninterest income from service charges on deposit accounts and broker dealer and insurance revenue totaled million in compared to offsetting these increases was a million gain on a sale of a branch building in compared to no such gain in noninterest expenses were down million in when compared to this decrease was driven primarily by three factors 
first  there was a slight recovery of merger costs of million in compared to million in merger charges in that resulted primarily from the acquisition of cnb 
second  the stabilization of residual values of leased automobiles resulted in no provision for the other than temporary impairment in residual values of leased automobiles in compared to a million provision in lastly  because of accounting standards that became effective for the company in fiscal year  amortization of goodwill and unidentified intangible assets decreased million in if these accounting standards had been applied in  the decrease in the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets would increase diluted earnings per share by in asset liability management the company attempts to maximize net interest income  and net income  while actively managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity through the mix of various core deposit products and other sources of funds  which in turn fund an appropriate mix of earning assets

net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  the company s net interest income for was million  down from million for the company s net interest margin declined to for from for the decline in the net interest margin resulted primarily from earning assets repricing downward faster than interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points bp  from for to for meanwhile  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased bp  from for to for additionally  historically low interest rates for residential real estate increased prepayments and refinancing activity during  which in turn increased amortization expense of investment security premiums related to mortgage backed securities

residential real estate mortgages increased million or from million at annual report nbt bancorp inc 
december  to million at december  the increase in residential real estate mortgages was driven by a combination of historically low interest rates increasing the demand for the product and the integration and centralization of the mortgage origination function for the company s three divisional banks at the end of centralizing the mortgage origination function enabled the company to provide customers with efficient service and competitive products while strengthening the company s market presence 
home equity loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december  the increase in home equity loans was due again to the previously mentioned increased demand from the historically low interest rate environment combined with a strong product that has sold well historically in the nbt bank division 
the company expanded its training programs for the sales staff of its pennstar and cnb bank divisions and experienced strong sales of its home equity products in these newer markets and maintained strong growth within its nbt bank division during all other loan categories experienced modest increases during the following table reflects the loan and lease portfolio by major categories as of december for the years indicated table composition of loan and lease portfolio december  in thousands residential real estate mortgages      commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction and development      agricultural and agricultural real estate      consumer      home equity      lease financing      total loans and leases      real estate mortgages consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residencies 
loans in the commercial and agricultural category  as well as commercial and agricultural real estate mortgages  consist primarily of short term and or floating rate loans made to small to medium sized entities 
consumer loans consist primarily of installment credit to individuals secured by automobiles and other personal property including manufactured housing 
manufactured housing loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and were and of total consumer loans at december  and  respectively 
these decreases from to are consistent with the company s plan to de emphasize loans secured by manufactured housing 
the company s automobile lease financing portfolio totaled million at december  and million at december  lease receivables primarily represent automobile financing to customers through direct financing leases and are carried at the aggregate of the lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values  net of unearned income and net deferred lease origination fees and costs 
net deferred lease origination fees and costs are amortized under the effective interest method over the estimated lives of the leases 
the estimated residual value related to the total lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly  and if there has been a decline in the estimated fair value of the residual that is judged by management to be other than temporary  including consideration of residual value insurance  a loss is recognized 
adjustments related to such other than temporary declines in estimated fair value are recorded with other noninterest expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
one of the most significant risks associated with leasing operations is the recovery of the residual value of the leased vehicles at the annual report nbt bancorp inc 
termination of the lease 
when a lease receivable asset is recorded  included in this amount is the estimated residual value of the leased vehicle at the termination of the lease 
at termination  the lessor has the option to purchase the vehicle or may turn the vehicle over to the company 
the residual values included in lease financing receivables totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has acquired residual value insurance protection in order to reduce the risk related to residual values 
based on analysis performed by management  the company has concluded that no other than temporary impairment exists which would warrant a charge to earnings during december  and the following table  maturities and sensitivities of certain loans to changes in interest rates  are the maturities of the commercial and agricultural and real estate and construction development loan portfolios and the sensitivity of loans to interest rate fluctuations at december  scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the contractual payment is due

the low interest rate environment prevalent throughout resulted in lower yields as reinvestment of funds from maturities  sales and paydowns led to the purchase of lower yielding securities 
additionally  the low rate environment fostered an increase in the refinancing of residential real estate mortgages  which increased the prepayment speeds of mortgage backed security investments resulting in an increase in bond premium amortization in lastly  to manage its risk to rising interest rates  the company shortened the average life of securities available for sale by increasing its investment in fifteen and ten year mortgage backed securities and lowering its exposure to thirty year mortgage backed securities 
at december   approximately of securities available for sale were comprised of fifteen ten year mortgage backed securities and were comprised of thirty twenty year mortgaged backed securities 
at december   the mix was fifteen ten year mortgage backed securities and thirty twenty year mortgaged backed securities 
in the event of a rising rate environment  the company should be positioned to reinvest cashflows at a faster rate from shortening the expected life of the portfolio 
the average balance of securities held to maturity decreased slightly from million in to million in at december   securities held to maturity were comprised primarily of tax exempt municipal securities 
the yield on securities held to maturity declined annual report nbt bancorp inc 
from in to in the decline in yield was due mainly to the previously mentioned low rate environment prevalent throughout investments in frb and fhlb banks increased to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by an increase in the investment in fhlb resulting from an increase in the company s borrowing capacity at fhlb 
the yield from investments in frb and fhlb banks declined from in to in the decrease in yield resulted primarily from the suspension of the october dividend by the fhlb as a result of capital concerns and credit issues in the fhlb investment security portfolio 
the fhlb has indicated that it intends to pay quarterly dividends in if the interest rate environment remains unchanged at a rate below 
the company classifies its securities at date of purchase as either available for sale  held to maturity or trading 
held to maturity debt securities are those that the company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are recorded at fair value  with net unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in income 
transfers of securities between categories are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
securities with an other than temporary impairment are generally placed on non accrual status 
non marketable equity securities are carried at cost  with the exception of small business investment company sbic investments  which are carried at fair value in accordance with sbic rules 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses on securities sold are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
the company recorded a million and million pre tax charge during and related to estimated other than temporary impairment of certain securities classified as available for sale

these securities contained a higher level of credit risk when compared to other securities held in the company s investment portfolio because they are not guaranteed by a governmental agency or a government sponsored enterprise gse 
the company s general practice is to purchase cmo and mortgagebacked securities that are guaranteed by a governmental agency or a gse coupled with a strong credit rating  typically aaa  issued by moody s or standard and poors

the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level estimated by management to provide adequately for risk of probable losses inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is continuously monitored 
it is assessed for adequacy using a methodology designed to ensure the level of the allowance reasonably reflects the loan and lease portfolio s risk profile 
it is evaluated to ensure that it is sufficient to absorb all reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgements can have on the consolidated results of operations 
for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  the company considers a number of significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio 
for individually analyzed loans  these include estimates of loss exposure  which reflect the facts and circumstances that affect the likelihood of repayment of such loans as of the evaluation date 
for homogeneous pools of loans and leases  estimates of the company s exposure to credit loss reflect a current assessment of a number of factors  which could affect collectibility 
these factors include past loss experience  size  trend  composition  and nature  changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge offs and recoveries  trends experienced in nonperforming and delinquent loans  current economic conditions in the company s market  portfolio concentrations that may affect loss experienced across one or more components of the portfolio  the effect of external factors such as competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
in addition  various regulatory agencies and the company s independent auditors  as an integral component of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their examination 
after a thorough consideration of the factors discussed above  any required additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made periodically by charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
these charges are necessary to maintain the allowance at a level which management believes is reasonably reflective of overall inherent risk of probable loss in the portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases  additions to the allowance may fluctuate from one reporting period to another 
these fluctuations are reflective of changes in risk associated with portfolio content and or changes in management s assessment of any or all of the determining factors discussed above 
total nonperforming assets were million at december   compared to million at december  nonperforming loans totaled million at december   down significantly from the million outstanding at december  the decrease in nonperforming loans in resulted primarily from the company s successful efforts in selling certain large problematic commercial loans and a group of nonperforming real estate mortgages at approximately their book value during the quarter ended march  additionally  the company continued to workout or chargeoff additional nonperforming loans for the remainder of without experiencing any significant migration of new nonperforming loans during the year 
as a result of the reduction in nonperforming loans during  the total allowance for loan and lease losses is of non performing loans at december  as compared to at december  while loans and leases classified as non performing have a strong likelihood of experiencing a loss  substantially all nonperforming loans are collateralized  many to a reasonably high percentage of the outstanding loan balance 
impaired loans  which primarily consist of nonaccruing commercial type loans also decreased significantly  totaling million at december  as compared to million at december  the related allowance for these impaired loans is million or of the impaired loans at december  as compared to million and  respectively  at december  at december  and there were million and million  respectively  of impaired loans which did not have an allowance for loan losses due to the adequacy of their collateral or previous charge offs 
total net charge offs for totaled million as compared to million for the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was for and for the decrease in net charge offs in resulted from the reduction in nonperforming loans and an improvement in loan quality 
however  the amount provided for loan and lease losses for remained relatively unchanged from  as improvements in loan quality were offset by strong loan growth

total nonperforming assets were million at december   compared to million at december  nonperforming loans totaled million at december   down significantly from the million outstanding at december  the million decrease in nonperforming loans from december  to december   was due to the company s successful efforts in resolving certain large problematic commercial loans as well as loan charge offs 
nonaccrual commercial and agricultural loans decreased million  from million at december   to million at december  the improvement in the company s loan quality ratios are a direct result of the actions the company took in to integrate credit administration functions of acquired banks into the company s conservative credit culture 
based on the improved trends in loan quality noted above and the decrease in net charge offs in when compared to highlighted in table above  the company recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of million for the year ended december   down from the million provided in the same period in the company s strategic focus on loan growth  particularly in commercial lending  was also a focus of the banks acquired by the company in and  cnb bank  la bank  na and pioneer american bank  na see also mergers and acquisition 
these acquired banks underwrote numerous commercial related loans prior to merging with the company  based upon their respective underwriting processes and analysis  including several larger credits which became non performing in additionally  cnb bank significantly increased its consumer loan portfolio in recent years 
accordingly  the company s loan growth in general  in particular the growth in higher credit risk loan types  combined with the fact that the recently acquired banks appeared to have used generally less conservative underwriting and monitoring standards increased the inherent risk of loss in the loan and lease portfolio 
as the company s loan and lease portfolio continued to grow and the loan mix continued to move in the direction of higher credit risk loan types  the economy in the company s market areas took a dramatic turn for the worse in  especially in the second half of this annual report nbt bancorp inc 
sudden economic down turn came at a particularly bad time for the company given the growth in the company s higher credit risk loan types 
the difficult economic environment experienced in the company s market areas was consistent with what has been experienced by the national economy throughout and resulted in  among other things  significant reductions in many borrowers revenues and cash flows as well as reduced valuations for certain real estate and other collateral 
in fact  certain large commercial relationships in the company s portfolio reported significant deterioration in the later part of  primarily due to the difficult economic environment 
during  the company completed the integration process with respect to the pennstar banking division formerly la bank  na and pioneer american bank n 
a the company s integration efforts with the recently merged cnb banking division was completed in the integration process included bringing these banking divisions credit administration practices in line with the bank s policies  adopting the bank s credit risk grading system  and upgrading numerous commercial real estate and other collateral appraisals 
at december   the credit administration function of the pennstar and cnb banking divisions  including workout and collections  was consolidated and standardized using the bank model  and key personnel from the bank s commercial lending area were installed at pennstar and cnb to oversee the lending operations of the respective divisions 
as a result of the economic downturn  and the integration processes with respect to acquired banks discussed above  the company performed an extensive review of its loan portfolio during this review focused on consistency in the identification and classification of problematic loans and the measurement of loss exposure on individual loans  especially in light of the generally weakened financial performance of borrowers caused by the economic downturn and reduced collateral values 
non performing loans increased from million at december  to million at december  the vast majority  approximately  of nonperforming loans are in the non accrual category 
within non accrual loans  all loan types experienced significant increases  however  the largest increase was in the commercial and agricultural loans 
commercial and agricultural non accrual loans  increased million from million at december  to million at december  consumer non accrual loans also significantly increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of the reduction in nonperforming loans during  the total allowance for loan and lease losses was of non performing loans at december  as compared to at december  impaired loans  which primarily consist of nonaccruing commercial type loans and all loans restructured in a troubled debt restructuring  also decreased significantly  totaling million at december  as compared to million at december  the related allowance for these impaired loans was million or of the impaired loans at december  as compared to million and  respectively  at december  at december  and there were million and million  respectively  of impaired loans which did not have an allowance for loan losses due to the adequacy of their collateral or previous charge offs 
total net charge offs for totaled million as compared to million for the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was for and for the decrease in net charge offs in resulted from the reduction in nonperforming loans and an improvement in loan quality 
however  the level of net charge offs experienced in was higher than the company s net charge off experience prior to the higher level of net charge offs in  resulted from the increase in nonperforming loans in net charge offs in exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses as a result of the company fully reserving certain of the charge offs  primarily related to nonaccruing loans in as mentioned previously  the provision for loan and lease losses for totaled million down from the million provided in the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by category  as well as the percentage of loans and leases in each category to total loans and leases  as prepared by the company 
this allocation is based on management s assessment of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio as of a given point in time and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
the allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts of the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category

at the company  potential problem loans are typically loans that are performing but are classified by the company s loan rating system as substandard 
at december   potential problem loans primarily consisted of commercial and agricultural real estate and commercial and agricultural loans 
at december   there were eight potential problem loans that exceeded million  totaling million in aggregate 
management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual  become restructured  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
at december   approximately of the company s loans are secured by real estate located in central and northern new york and northeastern pennsylvania 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the company s portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions of those areas 
management is not aware of any material concentrations of credit to any industry or individual borrowers 
liquidity risk liquidity involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
the asset liability committee alco is responsible for liquidity management and has developed guidelines which cover all assets and liabilities  as well as off balance sheet items that are potential sources or uses of liquidity 
liquidity policies must also provide the flexibility to implement appropriate strategies and tactical actions 
requirements change as loans and leases grow  deposits and securities mature  and payments on borrowings are made 
liquidity management includes a focus on interest rate sensitivity management with a goal of avoiding widely fluctuating net interest margins through periods of changing economic conditions 
the primary liquidity measurement the company utilizes is called the basic surplus which captures the adequacy of its access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of its funding mix of average liabilities 
this approach recognizes the importance of balancing levels of cash flow liquidity from short and long term securities with the availability of dependable borrowing sources which can be accessed when necessary 
at december   the company s basic surplus measurement was of total assets or million  which was above the company s minimum of or million set forth in its liquidity policies 
this basic surplus approach enables the company to adequately manage liquidity from both operational and contingency perspectives 
by tempering the need for cash flow liquidity with reliable borrowing facilities  the annual report nbt bancorp inc 
company is able to operate with a more fully invested and  therefore  higher interest income generating  securities portfolio 
the makeup and term structure of the securities portfolio is  in part  impacted by the overall interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
investment decisions and deposit pricing strategies are impacted by the liquidity position 
at december   the company considered its basic surplus adequate to meet liquidity needs 
a significant improvement in the economy  may lead to an increase in demand for loan products as well as an increase in the demand for equity related products  which in turn  could result in a decrease in the company s deposit base or result in loan growth exceeding deposit growth 
this scenario could lead to a decrease in its basic surplus measure below the minimum policy level of 
to manage this risk  the company has the ability to purchase brokered time deposits  established borrowing facilities with other banks federal funds  and has the ability to enter into repurchase agreements with investment companies 
the additional liquidity that could be provided by these measures amounted to million at december  at december   a portion of the company s loans and securities were pledged as collateral on borrowings 
therefore  future growth of earning assets will depend upon the company s ability to obtain additional funding  through growth of core deposits and collateral management  and may require further use of brokered time deposits  or other higher cost borrowing arrangements 
net cashflows provided by operating activities totaled million in and million in the critical elements of net operating cashflows include net income  provision for loan and lease losses  and depreciation and amortization 
cash provided by opreating activities declined in primarily from the purchase of million in bank owned life insurance boli 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in and million in critical elements of investing activities are loan and investment securities transactions 
the increase in investing activities in was due primarily to the net increase in loans of million 
net cashflows provided by financing activities totaled million in and million in the critical elements of financing activities are proceeds from deposits  long term debt  short term borrowings  and stock issuances 
in addition  financing activities are impacted by dividends and treasury stock transactions 
the company increased short term borrowings to fund loan growth because of their lower cost compared to time deposits 
deposits  which are also used as a primary funding source  grew million from increases in demand deposits  now  mmda and savings due primarily to internal growth and a migration of time deposits which experienced a decline in in connection with its financing and operating activities  the company has entered into certain contractual obligations 
the company s future minimum cash payments  excluding interest  associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its borrowing agreements and operating leases at december  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands thereafter total short term debt obligations   long term debt obligations        operating lease obligations       total contractual obligations        see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations 
off balance sheet risk commitments to extend credit the company makes contractual commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit which are subject to the company s credit approval and monitoring procedures 
at december  and  commitments to extend credit in the form of loans  including unused lines of credit  amounted to million and million  respectively 
in the opinion of management  there are no material commitments to extend credit  including unused lines of credit  that represent unusual risks 
all commitments to extend credit in the form of loans  including unused lines of credit expire within one year

under fin no 
 the company does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure  other than its stand by letters of credit 
the company guarantees the obligations or performance of customers by issuing stand by letters of credit to third parties 
these stand by letters of credit are frequently issued in support of third party debt  such as corporate debt issuances  industrial revenue bonds  and municipal securities 
the risk involved in issuing stand by letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same credit origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit and off balance sheet products 
typically  these instruments have terms of five years or less and expire unused  therefore  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  and  outstanding stand by letters of credit were approximately million and million  respectively

impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the direction of  or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on the company s net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interestbearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
in an attempt to manage the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
management s asset liability committee alco meets monthly to review the company s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to recommend strategies for consideration by the board of directors 
management also reviews loan and deposit pricing  and the company s securities portfolio  formulates investment and funding strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may determine to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable annual report nbt bancorp inc 
to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the primary tool utilized by alco to manage interest rate risk is a balance sheet income statement simulation model interest rate sensitivity analysis 
information such as principal balance  interest rate  maturity date  cash flows  next repricing date if needed  and current rates is uploaded into the model to create an ending balance sheet 
in addition  alco makes certain assumptions regarding prepayment speeds for loans and leases and mortgage related investment securities along with any optionality within the deposits and borrowings 
the model is first run under an assumption of a flat rate scenario ie no change in current interest rates with a static balance sheet over a month period 
three additional models are run in which a gradual increase of bp  a gradual increase of bp where the long end of the yield curve remains flat the long end of the yield curve is defined as years and longer and a gradual decrease of bp takes place over a month period with a static balance sheet 
under these scenarios  assets subject to prepayments are adjusted to account for faster or slower prepayment assumptions 
any investment securities or borrowings that have callable options embedded into them are handled accordingly based on the interest rate scenario 
the resultant changes in net interest income are then measured against the flat rate scenario 
in the declining rate scenario  net interest income is projected to increase slightly when compared to the forecasted net interest income in the flat rate scenario through the simulation period 
the increase in net interest income is a result of interest bearing liabilities repricing downward at a faster rate than earning assets 
the inability to effectively lower deposit rates will likely reduce or eliminate the benefit of lower interest rates 
in the rising rate scenarios  net interest income is projected to experience a decline from the flat rate scenario 
net interest income is projected to remain at lower levels than in a flat rate scenario through the simulation period primarily due to a lag in assets repricing while funding costs increase 
the potential impact on earnings is dependent on the ability to lag deposit repricing 
net interest income for the next twelve months in the flat bp scenarios  as described above  is within the internal policy risk limits of not more than a change in net interest income 
the following table summarizes the percentage change in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios over a month period from the forecasted net interest income in the flat rate scenario using the december  balance sheet position table interest rate sensitivity analysis change in interest rates percent change in basis points in net interest income flat under the flat rate scenario with a static balance sheet  net interest income is anticipated to increase approximately from total net interest income for the company anticipates under current conditions  earning assets will continue to reprice down at a faster rate than interest bearing liabilities 
however  the growth in loans experienced in the second half of should minimize the impact of margin compression 
in order to protect net interest income from anticipated net interest margin compression  the company will continue to focus on increasing earning assets through loan growth and leverage opportunities 
however  if the company cannot maintain the level of earning assets at december   the company expects net interest income to decline in currently  the company is holding fixed rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio and mortgage related securities in its investment portfolio 
two major factors the company considers in holding residential real estate mortgages is its level of core deposits and the duration of its mortgage related securities and loans 
current core deposit levels combined with a shortening of duration of mortgage related securities and loans have enabled the company to hold fixed rate residential real estate mortgages without having a significant negative impact on interest rate risk  as the company is well matched at december  the company s net interest income is projected to decrease by if interest rates gradually rise basis points 
from december   we have reduced our exposure to year fixed rate mortgage related securities and loans by million 
approximately of earning assets were comprised of year fixed rate mortgage related securities and loans at december   down from a ratio of at december  the company closely monitors its matching of earning assets to funding sources 
if core deposit levels decrease or the rate of growth in core deposit levels does not equal or exceed the rate in growth of year fixed rate real estate mortgage related securities or loans  the company will reevaluate its strategy and may sell new originations of annual report nbt bancorp inc 
fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market or may sell certain mortgage related securities in order to limit the company s exposure to long term earning assets
