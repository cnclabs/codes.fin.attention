a more formalized approach in these areas was recently initiated when we commenced a six sigma effort within cintas

results of operations fiscal marked the th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas 
in addition to achieving this milestone  cintas experienced healthy improvements in profitability  cash flow and balance sheet strength 
this was accomplished while finalizing the integration of the largest uniform rental acquisition in cintas history  omni services  inc omni 
cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments rentals and other services 
the rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents  along with other items  to its customers 
the other services operating segment involves the design  manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services 
these ancillary products and services include restroom supplies  first aid and safety products and services  document management services and cleanroom supplies 
all of these services are provided throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated revenue rentals other services total revenue cost of sales rentals other services total cost of sales gross margin rentals other services total gross margin selling and administrative expenses interest income interest expense write off of loan receivable income before income taxes as evidenced above  our revenue growth has been consistent between our reporting segments  with rentals and other services each accounting for a consistent percentage of revenue the past two fiscal years 
we have increased our gross margins in both segments in fiscal  while maintaining selling and administrative costs as a percent of revenues 
this overall income improvement occurred despite the soft economy that existed for much of the year and the continued rise in fuel  wage and benefit costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal total revenue was billion  an increase of over fiscal this growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed for much of the year 
internal growth for fiscal  when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal as compared to fiscal  was 
weakness in employment numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our business  mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products  and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective 
as employment numbers strengthened over the second half of the year  our internal growth rates improved 
internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below 
internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of work days  by quarter and for the year  where applicable 
internal growth first quarter ending august  second quarter ending november  third quarter ending february  fourth quarter ending may  for the year ending may  historically  increases in our internal growth rate have lagged employment growth levels as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs 
our organic growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base 
the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid and safety service businesses and document management businesses 
rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms  mats  shop towels and other rental services 
revenue from the rentals segment increased  when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal as compared to fiscal internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was  adjusted for the additional workday 
the amount of acquired rental volume was insignificant for the year ending may  the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base 
new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers 
we continue to expand our rental market  with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs 
rentals revenue growth was mitigated by lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the sluggish economy  especially during the first half of the year 
other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design  manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services 
other direct sale products and services include restroom and cleanroom supplies  first aid and safety products and services and document management services 
other services revenue increased  when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses 
internal revenue in the other services segment  adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal  decreased by for the year 
this decrease was mainly due to the continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the hospitality and airline industries 
weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers has continued to impact our direct sales effort 
partially offsetting this internal revenue decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale of first aid products and services and document management services 
cost of rentals increased over fiscal cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses  delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory  including uniforms and other rental items 
the cost increase over fiscal was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues 
an increase in fuel and energy costs and a rise in labor delivery costs also contributed to this increase 
further assimilation of operations obtained through the omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year mitigated the increased fuel  energy and delivery costs 
cost of other services increased over fiscal cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products  delivery expenses and distribution expenses 
the increase over fiscal was due to the growth in other services revenue  derived predominantly through acquisitions 
the increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage  thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and other cost containment initiatives  including six sigma initiatives  implemented throughout the year supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to other services revenue 
selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal  primarily due to increased revenues 
the continued rise in medical costs and increased legal expenses contributed to the increase 
net interest expense decreased million from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily a result of lower debt outstanding 
total outstanding debt decreased million from may  to may   as cash from operations was used to reduce debt which had been incurred predominantly during the acquisition of omni in may see the liquidity and capital resources section below and note entitled long term debt of note to consolidated financial statements 
a write off of a loan receivable from a garment manufacturer is included in net income as a pre tax charge of million 
due to developments concerning the supplier s viability to remain as a going concern  the collectibility of the receivable was doubtful 
as such  the receivable was completely written off 
pre tax income was million  a increase over fiscal pre tax income from the rentals segment increased over the prior year due to higher rental revenue  increased efficiencies obtained from the assimilation of operations obtained from the omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives 
pre tax income for the other services segment increased from the prior year  due to increased sales volume  the continued leveraging of fixed costs and sourcing and cost containment initiatives

cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions  capital expenditures and expansion 
marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 
accounts receivable increased million due to increased revenues 
aggressive collection efforts provided for a lower sequential increase in accounts receivable as compared to total revenue growth 
inventories decreased million due to improved processes and management systems  including cycle time reductions and other process improvements initiated primarily through our six sigma process 
the completion of the omni product line consolidation also contributed to this decrease in inventory levels 
net property and equipment increased by million due to real estate purchased in conjunction with acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses 
depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures by million as cintas continued to consolidate operations obtained from the omni acquisition in may of in addition  due to excess plant capacity and a sluggish economy  cintas slowed the pace of new plant construction 
during the year  cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and has an additional eight uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations 
total debt decreased million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of omni  net of the change in fair market value of the debt see note entitled long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal marked the th year of uninterrupted growth for cintas 
total revenue was billion  an increase of over fiscal this growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed throughout the year 
the continued weakness in employment numbers directly affected our business  mainly through reduced uniform wearers  and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective 
we continued to grow organically in this environment  mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs 
rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms  mats  shop towels and other items through our uniform rental division 
revenue from the rentals segment increased  primarily due to the acquisition of omni in the fourth quarter of fiscal and growth in the customer base 
despite slow economic growth  internal growth in the rentals segment  adjusted for one less workday during fiscal  averaged over for the year 
new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers 
we continue to expand our rental market  with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs 
rentals revenue growth was mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business  attributable to the current sluggish economy in the united states and the resulting reduction in the work force 
other services operating segment revenues are derived from the design  manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers  as well as the sale of ancillary services including restroom supplies  first aid products and services and cleanroom supplies 
other services revenue increased  primarily due to acquisitions made in late fiscal and increased customer sales 
despite slow economic growth  internal growth in the other services segment  adjusted for one less workday during fiscal  averaged for the year 
revenues from the sale of ancillary services increased for the year due to increased selling efforts 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the direct sale of uniforms to our customers 
this decrease was primarily a result of continued weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers 
revenue growth in other services was also mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the current sluggish economy in the united states and the resulting reduction in the work force 
cost of rentals increased over fiscal cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses  delivery expenses and amortization of in service uniforms and other rental items 
the cost increase over fiscal was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues 
a rise in fuel and energy costs as well as an increase in delivery costs associated with the omni acquisition primarily due to expanded route geography and smaller route size also contributed to this increase 
cost containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated the increased fuel  energy and delivery costs 
cost of other services increased over fiscal cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products  delivery expenses and distribution expenses 
the increase over fiscal was due to the growth in other services revenue  derived primarily through acquisitions

selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased revenues 
the continued rise in medical costs and additional travel expenses also contributed to this increase 
the increased travel expense was a result of the omni acquisition and related integration  as well as a return to more normalized travel versus fiscal  when travel expenses were lower due to the impact of the events of september we also continue to invest heavily in our selling process in order to provide for future growth 
net interest expense increased million from the prior year 
this increase was primarily a result of interest on million in long term notes issued in late fiscal to finance the omni acquisition see the liquidity and capital resources section below and note entitled long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pre tax income was million  a increase over fiscal pre tax income from the rentals segment increased over the prior year  primarily due to the higher rental revenue 
pre tax income was negatively impacted by assimilation costs associated with the omni acquisition 
pre tax income for the other services segment increased from the prior year  due to increased sales volume and related leveraging of fixed costs 
cost containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated increased delivery  medical and fuel costs

inventories increased million with additional levels needed to support customers obtained through acquisitions  including omni  and the conversion of omni customers to our product line 
additionally  cintas is now manufacturing more products for our cleanroom and flame resistant clothing customers 
net property and equipment decreased by million due to the excess of depreciation over capital expenditures 
certain capital expenditures were delayed in fiscal given reduced capacity requirements due to the sluggish economy 
in fiscal  cintas completed construction of six new uniform rental facilities and had an additional six uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations 
total debt decreased million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of omni  net of the change in fair market value of the debt see note entitled long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations 
liquidity and capital resources at may   cintas had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  representing an increase of million from may  this increase is primarily due to strong operational cash flows and a significant reduction in required inventory levels 
cash generated from operations was million in fiscal as compared to million generated in fiscal this million increase was primarily due to increased net income in fiscal and the significant reduction in inventory levels 
in fiscal  inventory levels increased million due to the acquisition of omni and the subsequent conversion of omni customers to the cintas product line 
additionally  cintas began manufacturing more products for cleanroom and flame resistant clothing customers 
in fiscal  inventory levels have decreased by million through significant process improvements  including six sigma initiatives  and the consolidation of the omni product line 
partially offsetting the increased cash flow was cash used for acquisitions of million 
other significant uses of cash in fiscal were debt repayments of million adjusted for a million change in derivatives  capital expenditures of million and dividends of million 
cintas investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative 
preservation of principal  while earning an attractive yield  is the criteria used in making investment decisions 
working capital increased million to million in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increased cash and marketable securities partially offset by the decrease in inventories discussed above 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million  including million for the rentals segment and million for other services 
cintas continues to reinvest in land  buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth 
cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal will be between and million 
on may   cintas completed the acquisition of omni for approximately million 
this acquisition  coupled with smaller acquisitions in both the rentals and other services segments  were financed with a combination of approximately million in cash  million in long term notes  and approximately million in commercial paper 
as a result of this additional debt  the total debt to total capitalization ratio was at may  significant debt repayments occurred in fiscal million and fiscal million 
the total debt to total capitalization ratio has decreased to at may  the million in long term notes consist of million with five year maturities at a rate of and million with ten year maturities at a rate of 
cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of a from standard poor s and a from moody s 
cintas also utilizes a million commercial paper program  on which it has earned credit ratings of a from standard poor s and prime from moody s 
these ratings reflect cintas commitment to conservative financial policies  strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions 
the commercial paper program is fully supported by a long term credit facility that matures in as of may   there is no commercial paper outstanding 
during the year  cintas paid dividends of million  or per share

inflation and changing prices changes in wage  benefits and oil and fuel costs have the potential to materially impact cintas financial results 
medical benefit costs in particular continue to rise  increasing approximately annually over the last three fiscal years 
medical benefits accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas financial condition or a negative impact on operations 
litigation and environmental matters cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business  including personal injury  customer contract  environmental and employment claims 
in the opinion of management  the aggregate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course of business actions  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of cintas 
cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business  including the litigation discussed below 
cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit  paul veliz  et al  v 
cintas corporation  filed on march   in the united states district court  northern district of california  oakland division  alleging that cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service sales representatives  whom cintas considers exempt employees  and asserting additional related erisa claims 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages  injunctive relief  or both 
cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs allegations 
the court ordered arbitration for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four narrowly defined exceptions 
as a result  cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be required to arbitrate their claims 
no determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class certification 
there can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or  if a class is certified  as to the geographic or other scope of such class 
if a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits  or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action  the resulting liability and or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to cintas 
any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time 
cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit  robert ramirez  et al  v 
cintas corporation  filed on january   and pending in the united states district court  northern district of california  san francisco division 
the case was brought on behalf of all past and present female  african american and hispanic employees of cintas and its subsidiaries 
the complaint alleges that cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment  hiring  promotions  transfers  job assignments and pay 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief  compensatory damages  punitive damages and attorney s fees  among other things 
cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs allegations 
no filings or determination has been made as to class certification 
there can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or  if a class is certified  as to the geographic or other scope of such class 
if a court certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits  or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action  the resulting liability and or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to cintas 
any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time 
the litigation discussed above  if decided adversely to or settled by cintas  may result in liability material to cintas financial condition or results of operations 
cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits  and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of cintas shareholders 
cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations  as are other companies in the industry 
while costs related to environmental compliance are not a material component of the cost of rentals  cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis 
environmental spending amounted to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal this spending includes labor and chemical costs for water treatment  as well as costs for waste removal 
capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
cintas adopted this interpretation on july   with no material effect to its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
cintas continues to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
for the method used to account for stock based employee compensation arrangements  where applicable  but has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas critical accounting policies the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note entitled significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes  estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 
cintas also establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility 
an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts  beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages 
the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments  because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances 
the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification  as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 
uniforms and other rental items in service uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization  calculated using the straight line method 
uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months 
other rental items including shop towels  mats  cleanroom garments  flame resistant garments  linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty eight months 
the amortization rates used are based on industry experience  cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas 
these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings  five to twenty years for building improvements  three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recorded 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values  as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less estimated costs related to disposition 
goodwill and impairment goodwill  primarily obtained through acquisitions of businesses  is valued at cost less any impairment 
cintas performs an annual impairment test 
based on the results of the impairment tests  cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may   or service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets  which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses  are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements  which are generally five to ten years 
certain noncompete agreements  as well as all service contracts  require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates  among other factors 
because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets  actual results over time could vary from original estimates 
environmental and litigation cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded 
while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities  cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements 
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is included in note entitled litigation and environmental matters of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
please reference note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date 
cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  cintas records reserves for probable exposures 
based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions  cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
outlook as we look forward to fiscal  our outlook is positive  but guarded 
the economy has been gaining traction as employment figures strengthen 
our internal growth rates have been improving as well 
we see significant upside potential for all of our business units  especially given our relatively low market share of a billion estimated potential market 
although difficult to predict  we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units 
overall performance will be largely driven by the continued recovery in the economy 
in the marketplace  competition and related pricing pressure will continue  however  we believe cost containment initiatives  technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 
when appropriate opportunities arise  we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
like most other companies  we experienced  and anticipate continuing to experience  increased costs for wages and benefits  including medical benefits 
changes in oil and fuel costs also have the potential to impact our results 
cintas is currently the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions 
these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a government supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation 
this is unacceptable 
cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no 
this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations 
we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights 
we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure  quality products  financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success 
however  a number of factors influence future revenue  margins and profit which make forecasting difficult 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt  marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements 
earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately million  with an average interest rate of 
this exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short term rates 
if short term rates change by one half percent or basis points  cintas income before taxes would change by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure
