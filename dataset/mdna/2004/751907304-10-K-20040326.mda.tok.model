critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized upon shipment as the company generally does not have any post shipment obligations or allow for any acceptance provisions 
the company defers recognition of sales to distributors when it is unable to make a reasonable estimate of product returns due to insufficient historical product return information 
the revenue recorded is dependent upon estimates of expected customer returns and sales discounts 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period the company is required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
revenue from research and development activities that are funded by customers are recognized as the services are performed  generally  as contractual milestones are met 
in situations where the company licenses its technology and also provides development assistance  the company records the total proceeds to be received as revenue over the longer licensing period 
the revenue recorded by the company in each reporting period is dependent upon estimates regarding the cost of projects and the achievement of milestones 
revenue from royalties is recognized upon the shipment of product from the company s technology license partners to direct customers 
the company records customer sponsored research and development revenue on arrangements entered into with customers 
the revenue recorded by the company in each reporting period is dependent upon estimates regarding the cost of projects and the achievement of milestones 
changes in estimates regarding these matters could result in revisions to the amount of revenue recognized on these arrangements 
page allowance for uncollectible accounts 
while the company maintains a stringent credit approval process  significant judgments are made by management in assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continue to monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory valuation 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under current standards  the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
during  the company recorded million of intangible asset impairments related to its ems subsidiary 
these impairments were the result of changing business conditions that decreased the likelihood that certain intangible assets would provide sufficient cash flows to support the historical cost valuations 
the fair values were determined by obtaining an appraisal from an independent consulting firm specializing in such valuations 
there can be no assurance that future long lived asset impairments will not occur 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of december   and determined that no impairments existed at that date 
however  due to changing business conditions in its mushkin business unit the company performed an additional goodwill impairment test as of june  and recorded a million impairment charge see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company completed its annual analysis of the fair value of its goodwill and determined there was no impairment of page its goodwill 
this assessment requires estimates of future revenue  operating results and cash flows  as well as estimates of critical valuation inputs such as discount rates  terminal values and similar data 
the company will continue to perform periodic and annual impairment analyses of goodwill resulting from its acquisitions 
as a result of such impairment analyses  impairment charges may be recorded and may have a material adverse impact on the financial position and operating results of the company 
additionally  the company may make strategic business decisions in future periods which impact the fair value of goodwill  which could result in significant impairment charges 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
deferred income taxes 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
results of operations overview since its inception  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and dram products 
revenue has been derived from the sale of the company s fram and dram products beginning in the company has also generated revenue under license and development agreements entered into with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers and involving the development of specific applications of the company s technologies 
accordingly  fluctuations in the company s revenue have resulted primarily from the timing of significant product orders  the timing of the signing of license and development agreements  and the achievement of related performance milestones 
the company s total revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  and  fram product sales represented approximately  and of total product sales revenue  respectively  ems product sales accounted for  and  respectively  while mushkin product sales represented  and for the same periods 
during these periods  product sales revenue accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenue  the remainder of which was generated principally from license and development fees  royalties and customer sponsored research and development revenue 
page fram product sales have become the dominate source of revenue for the company as a result of an expansion of the fram customer base  deeper penetration of existing customers  an expanding fram product portfolio and our participation in the utility meter replacement program at enel  a leading italian utility company  which is replacing  utility meters in italy 
the enel program began in late and is expected to continue until mid ramtron has been generating average quarterly revenue of approximately million related to this program since the beginning of we expect this program to continue to generate revenue of approximately million per quarter until mid in addition  the company has been able to significantly increase revenue from other fram customers during each of the last three years with non enel product revenue totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
mushkin revenue for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during this period  mushkin s business transitioned from generating revenue predominately from e commerce sources to a business with a substantial retail presence by distributing its products through fry s electronics 
currently fry s sales represent approximately of mushkin s annual revenue 
also  during the latter part of  mushkin began to focus on lower volume  higher margin sales opportunities to improve its overall financial performance 
this had the effect of reducing revenue but improving net income exclusive of goodwill impairment charges in the company s costs and expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales exclusive of provisions for inventory write offs was  and for  and  respectively 
correspondingly  gross margin rates were for compared with in and in the improvements in gross margin rates have resulted primarily from a change in sales mix 
fram product sales began to be the dominant source of revenue in and fram product sales generate significantly higher margin rates than mushkin product sales 
in addition  the company has been able to reduce its cost of fram manufacturing through a combination of price reductions from its wafer supplier and subcontract assembly and test suppliers and also through a more economical fram cell structure that reduced the size of each unit produced for the enel program by approximately  improving margins for its fram segment 
fram product gross margins during were  compared with in and in mushkin product gross margins during were  compared with in and in mushkin margin improvements in as compared to are primarily the result of improved average selling prices for mushkin s products 
page research and development expenses  including customer sponsored research and development  were million in  compared with million in and million in the changes in research and development expenses are primarily related to an increased allocation of fram engineering resources to manufacturing support activities as product revenue increased and reduced product development expenses at the company s ems subsidiary 
during  and  ems was engaged in product development programs with cypress semiconductor corporation  hewlett packard and infineon  incurring significant expenses for contract design support  photomask and wafer costs to support these programs 
in the second quarter of  the company determined it was uneconomical to continue with the development of ems products due to significant future engineering costs required to bring its products to market and uncertainty related to its ability to manufacture products profitably and achieve sufficient market penetration 
additionally  in june  ems was notified by its primary contract engineering service customers that collaborative product development programs would be discontinued 
as a result  the company will no longer pursue sales or development of ems dram products 
sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
decreases in these expenses from to are primarily the result of on going cost reduction activities which reduced salary  employee benefit and travel expenses 
the decrease of million from to is primarily attributable to new accounting standards that eliminated the amortization of goodwill beginning january  specific charges and impairments reflect costs incurred from strategic actions implemented by the company to restructure its operations and costs due to asset dispositions and impairments 
such charges totaled million in and million in the actions taken during and are as follows during the second quarter of  the company announced its intention to realign operations of its ems subsidiary  improving operational efficiency and concentrating the company s resources on its fram product business 
in april  as part of the realignment  ems reached an agreement with hewlett packard  its principal customer  to release the company from future development and engineering costs and product delivery requirements 
the original terms of the development contract  which included product sales upon the completion of the product development phase of the contract  would have been financially unfavorable to the company given the contractual selling price of the product relative to present and expected wafer foundry and manufacturing costs 
under its revised agreement with hewlett packard  ems expected to provide contract engineering and design services in support of the joint product development program for an additional six to twelve months 
however  in june  hewlett packard notified the company its engineering services would not be required beyond july  ems also generated revenue from the product development program page it entered into with infineon 
in june  infineon decided not to market the product ems was developing for it 
as a result of the changes in the hewlett packard and infineon engineering services agreements  the company will no longer pursue product or service revenue related to ems dram technology 
specific charges related to these events totaled million for the write down of excess and obsolete inventory  intellectual property and manufacturing process technology rights 
a sustained downturn in dram market conditions resulted in lower than expected actual and projected revenue and profitability of mushkin during the first half of because the company believed the downturn was likely to continue to cause lower than expected sales and profitability for some time into the future the company believed it was appropriate to review the fair value of goodwill related to mushkin 
the result of the company s review was a charge of million for impairment of goodwill during during  the company recorded a loss of million on the disposition of  shares of infineon common stock owned by the company  consisting of all the shares obtained through a share purchase agreement with infineon dated december  during  the company recorded charges totaling  for excess and obsolete inventories  of which  related to its fram products and  related to ems products 
as a result of the company s limited revenue as compared to its substantial ongoing product research and development and other costs  the company has incurred losses on a consolidated basis in each fiscal year since its inception and has required substantial capital infusions in the form of debt and equity financing 
net losses for  and are million  million and million  respectively 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to revenue 
total revenue for decreased million  or from revenue from product sales decreased million  or  from fram product revenue for increased million to million  from increased fram product revenue is primarily attributable to increased shipments to non enel customers

the company expects the enel component of its revenue during will remain a significant portion of total fram product revenue 
additionally  the company recorded revenue of approximately  related to a change in our estimate of returns from distributors during the company historically recorded all shipments to distributors as deferred revenue until shipped to the end customer because the company did not believe it had adequate historical data page to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of future returns as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists

there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
impairment of intangible assets 
as discussed above  during  the company realigned its ems subsidiary and will no longer pursue sales or development of ems dram products 
this caused the company to review the valuation of ems intangible asset portfolio and resulted in the recording of impairment charges of million to adjust the asset carrying values to their estimated fair value at june  the fair values were determined by obtaining an appraisal from an independent consulting firm specializing in such valuations

the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  achieving forecasted revenue growth  success in raising additional financing to fund operations  if needed  maintaining gross profit margins and entering into additional foundry  license and research and development arrangements 
there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
the company s current business plan contemplates revenue growth in due to increasing market penetration of the company s fram products and mushkin s dram module products

there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
any issuance of common or preferred stock to obtain additional funding would result in further dilution of existing stockholders interests in ramtron 
the inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and could adversely affect the company s ability to continue business operations

the company s purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price  quantity  delivery and termination liability and are primarily the result of purchase orders placed but not yet fulfilled by fujitsu  the company s semiconductor wafer supplier 
legal matters 
the company is currently involved in a patent interference proceeding see item patent interference proceeding and note in the consolidated financial statements 
if the company is ultimately unsuccessful in these proceedings  there would be no retroactive cash payment requirements from the company to the junior party as a result of such an adverse decision 
while the company cannot accurately estimate the financial effects of such a result  the company believes that it could  depending on when a final non appealable judgment is ultimately rendered  materially adversely affect the company s fram product business and operating results and  thus  have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition as a whole 
new accounting standards 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

this interpretation clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity at risk is not sufficient for the page entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from others parties 
fin no 
requires a company to evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a variable interest commonly evidenced by a guarantee arrangement or other commitment to provide financial support in a variable interest entity commonly a thinly capitalized entity and further determine when such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest entities financial statements with its own 
the company is required to perform this assessment by march  and consolidate any variable interest entities for which it will absorb a majority of the entities expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual gains 
management does not believe it has any material variable interest entities that it would be required to consolidate
