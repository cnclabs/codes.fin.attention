item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a global prestige fragrances and beauty products company 
we sell our products to over  separate locations worldwide  including in the united states in department stores and mass retailers  as well as internationally in prestige department stores  perfumeries  boutiques and travel retail locations 
we have established ourselves as a source of over fragrance brands through brand ownership  brand licensing and distribution arrangements 
in addition to the approximately prestige fragrance brands we own and license  we also distribute over prestige fragrance brands principally to mass retailers in the united states 
our portfolio of owned and licensed fragrance brands includes elizabeth arden s red door  red door revealed  ardenbeauty  th avenue  elizabeth arden green tea  sunflowers and elizabeth arden provocative woman  elizabeth taylor s white diamonds  passion  forever elizabeth and gardenia  white shoulders  halston and z  geoffrey beene s grey flannel  ps fine cologne for men  design  and wings 
our skin care brands include ceramide  eight hour cream and first defense  and our cosmetics products include lipstick  foundation and other color cosmetics products under the elizabeth arden brand 
we offer our retail customers in the united states a broad portfolio of prestige beauty brands coupled with marketing and merchandising services to enhance sell through of the products we sell to our customers 
we distinguish ourselves by tailoring the marketing  promotion  size and packaging of our prestige fragrances to appeal to a wide range of consumers 
this tailoring allows us to sell the same brand in prestige department stores and mass retailers while maintaining its prestige image 
we also provide many of our mass retailers in the united states additional valuable services  including category and inventory management and fulfillment services that our competitors do not typically offer 
we believe that our breadth of products and level of services have enabled us to gain a leading share of the growing prestige fragrance category at mass retailers and to become an important and valued supplier for our customers 
our business strategy to increase sales and profitability is based on increasing the sales of our core brands through new product launches and increased advertising and marketing activities  growing the prestige fragrance category with our retail customers through innovative programs  expanding the offering of prestige fragrance products to these retailers through new owned or licensed products as well as through expanding the selection of prestige fragrances that we distribute on behalf of other beauty companies  acquiring control of additional prestige fragrance brands through licensing opportunities and acquisitions  and pursuing opportunities to improve profitability and working capital efficiencies 
we manage our business by evaluating net sales  ebitda as defined in note under item selected financial data and working capital utilization including through the levels of inventory and accounts receivable and borrowings under our credit facility 
we encounter a variety of challenges that may affect our business and should be considered along with the information presented in the section forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
these factors include the absence of contracts with our key customers and suppliers  changes in customer demands and preferences for prestige beauty products  in general  and for prestige fragrances  in particular  as approximately of our net sales are of prestige fragrances  the risks of international operations including the impact of foreign currency rates  the retail performance of our retail customers  their commitment to the prestige fragrance and beauty category and their execution of that category  competition  the efficient operation of our worldwide organization and our level of indebtedness

table of contents in fiscal  we successfully recapitalized our balance sheet through a public offering of our common stock and the refinancing of our long term debt 
we completed a public offering of common stock in october and used the proceeds to redeem a portion of our senior notes due by february  we redeemed substantially all of the remaining senior notes and all of the senior notes due with the net proceeds of a new issue of senior subordinated notes due  borrowings from our revolving credit facility and free cash flow 
the refinancing of our high cost senior notes with our new senior subordinated notes allowed us to i lock in long term interest rates at historically low levels  ii remove restrictive covenants in the indenture for our senior notes  iii remove the collateral securing our senior notes  iv extend the maturity of our long term debt  and v and is expected to result in a million reduction in interest expense in fiscal as a result of our improved operating performance in fiscal and and the equity financing which improved our balance sheet  our corporate credit rating was upgraded to b and b from b and b by the credit agencies moody s investors service in may and standard poor s in october  respectively 
in fiscal  we also consolidated all of our us distribution and warehouse operations to our newly expanded facility in roanoke  virginia and we completed the conversion of all primary order processing systems to a common platform in march this consolidation is expected to lower freight  labor  insurance and other overhead expenses  as well as improve working capital efficiencies through a reduction of duplicate inventory and enhanced order processing 
we expect to realize estimated savings of approximately to million in fiscal and approximately to million on an annual basis for the fiscal years thereafter compared to fiscal finally  we had several new product introductions  including the skin care product ceramide plump perfect and a color product  color intrigue  and the fragrances red door revealed and gardenia  all of which contributed to our net sales growth in fiscal in fiscal  we also implemented a number of initiatives to improve our cash collection efforts  including focusing our cash collection activities on certain key accounts and improving the accuracy of our order processing and transmission orders to reduce customer deductions and charge backs 
in addition  we were also able to reduce our inventory balances at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal by implementing key inventory reduction initiatives  including tightening purchasing activities and identifying methods of reducing inventory lead times 
in fiscal  net sales increased compared to fiscal as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency rates  which represents of the increase  increased sales to us mass retail accounts and new product launches 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of additional advertising to support new product launches and higher development costs  increased selling costs  the impact of foreign currency rates and the restructuring charge associated with the consolidation of our us distribution facilities 
in fiscal  we anticipate increasing our expenditures for advertising and promotional activities by utilizing a portion of the anticipated savings in interest expense associated with the debt refinancing activities 
debt extinguishment charges of million associated with the redemption of senior notes resulted in a net loss for fiscal compared to net income in fiscal in addition  net loss attributable to common shareholders in fiscal increased due to an million charge related to the accelerated accretion on the series d convertible preferred stock which was converted into common stock sold by an affiliate of unilever in our equity offering in october if the unilever affiliate converts the remaining series d convertible preferred stock into common stock and sells the stock in fiscal  we would incur an additional charge for accelerated accretion on the series d convertible preferred stock relating to the amounts converted 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies important in understanding our operating results and financial condition 
for additional accounting policies  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies for the application of these and other accounting policies 
logo 
table of contents accounting for acquisitions 
we have accounted for our acquisitions  including the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that require more judgment is determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we often obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
our intangible assets generally consist of exclusive brand licenses and trademarks 
we do not carry any goodwill 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we periodically review intangible assets  at least annually or more often as circumstances dictate  for impairment and the useful life assigned using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
during fiscal  we completed our annual impairment testing of these assets with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the analysis and assessments of these assets indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns represents management s estimate of future returns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for certain promotional product 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and markdowns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the logo 
table of contents estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee and director option grants  as such grants had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the pro forma effect on net income loss and diluted earnings loss per common share for fiscal  and is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for fiscal  and results of operations are in thousands and as a percentage of net sales were as follows percentages may not add due to rounding net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense debt extinguishment charges other expense income loss income before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net income loss accretion and dividend on preferred stock accelerated accretion on converted preferred stock net loss income attributable to common shareholders other data ebitda and ebitda margin restatement of percentages for fiscal was made based on eitf no

ebitda margin represents ebitda divided by net sales 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased approximately for fiscal over fiscal the sales increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates  increased fragrance sales to our mass retail customers  new product launches and strength in certain international markets 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales to certain us department store accounts  including a planned reduction in promotional sales to department store accounts to reduce related promotional costs  and lower international sales due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic and the iraqi war  which impacted asia and the travel retail business in the first half of the fiscal year  and economic weakness in most continental european markets 
gross profit 
gross profit increased for fiscal over fiscal the increase in gross profit was principally due to higher net sales  favorable impact of foreign currency rates  lower supply chain and distribution costs and lower gift with purchase costs  partially offset by a greater proportion of sales of distributed brands  which have lower gross margins than owned and licensed brands 
gross margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal over fiscal the increase was due principally to additional advertising to support product launches and higher product development costs  increased selling costs  the adverse impact of foreign currency rates and a million restructuring charge related to the consolidation of our us distribution facilities  which was announced in november and was substantially completed in march the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction gains contributed approximately million to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses versus the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by reduced overhead expenses from management initiatives and lower information technology costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects the increased advertising and product development costs  unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the restructuring charge 
we intend to increase our advertising and product development costs in fiscal to support our existing brands and new product launches 
we also expect to incur approximately million of restructuring charges in the first half of fiscal related to the final stages of the consolidation of our us distribution facilities 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional rent expense of approximately million  which is a cumulative correction to previously recorded amounts and is related to scheduled rent increases and lease incentives in certain of our operating leases 
the allocated additional expense was not material to our results of operations during the periods to which the adjustment related or in the period recorded and  as such  prior periods were not adjusted 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased for fiscal  compared to fiscal  principally as a result of certain intangibles that were fully logo 
table of contents amortized at the end of fiscal  partially offset by the acceleration of depreciation of certain fixed assets at our miami lakes facility due to the closing of the distribution operations at this facility 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by in fiscal from fiscal the decrease resulted from the redemptions of the senior notes due and the senior notes due during the year and reduced borrowings and lower interest rates paid on our bank credit facility 
see notes and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the refinancing of our senior notes  we anticipate saving approximately million in interest expense in fiscal debt extinguishment costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million of debt extinguishment charges relating to the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes and million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
benefit from provision for income taxes 
we had a benefit from income taxes for fiscal  as compared to a provision for income taxes for fiscal  reflecting higher losses due to the debt extinguishment and restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the us distribution facilities partially offset by higher operating earnings 
the effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss income before income taxes for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate as compared to the prior year primarily reflects adjustments for foreign earnings taxed in jurisdictions at rates different in the united states and state tax liabilities 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income for fiscal decreased approximately million as compared to fiscal the decrease was a result of the debt extinguishment and restructuring charges partially offset by higher operating earnings 
accretion and dividend on preferred stock 
the accretion and dividend on preferred stock  which is a non cash charge to net loss attributable to common shareholders  represents the accretion of the original carrying value of million of the series d convertible preferred stock to its liquidation preference  and the imputed dividends on such preferred stock 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accelerated accretion on converted preferred stock 
in october  we recorded accelerated accretion on the series d convertible preferred stock of million for the preferred stock converted into common stock by an affiliate of unilever that was sold in a public offering in october see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss income attributable to common shareholders 
in fiscal  there was a net loss attributable to common shareholders compared with net income attributable to common shareholders for fiscal  principally due to million of accelerated accretion on the series d convertible preferred stock converted into common stock in october and the million of debt extinguishment and restructuring charges 
as a result of the accelerated accretion on the conversion of our series d convertible preferred stock into common stock in october and the debt extinguishment and restructuring charges  our fully diluted net income per share for fiscal was reduced by per share compared to fiscal ebitda 
ebitda net income plus the provision for income taxes or net loss less the benefit from income taxes  plus interest expense  plus depreciation and amortization expense decreased by for fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in ebitda and ebitda margin was primarily the result of the debt extinguishment and restructuring charges partially offset by higher operating income 
during fiscal  ebitda was reduced by million as a result of the early extinguishment of debt and the restructuring of the us distribution facilities

table of contents fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the sales increase was driven by the growth of our business with our mass retail customers  due in large part to our open sell program and the addition of certain distributor brands both of which have increased the volume of products sold  new product launches including the fragrances ardenbeauty and forever elizabeth  and a rebound in travel retail sales 
the open sell program allows retailers to display fragrances on open counters and shelves rather than in locked cases  giving consumers easier access to our products 
these increases were partially offset by continued weakness in us department store sales and fewer us prestige department store doors serviced as a result of previously announced closings 
gross profit 
gross profit increased for fiscal compared to fiscal gross margin increased percentage points during fiscal from fiscal the increase in gross profit and gross margin was principally due to higher sales  a reduction in the effect of the high cost elizabeth arden inventory purchased prior to the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  a million inventory write down recorded in fiscal and reduced cost structure in distribution operations  partially offset by continued weakness in us department stores and a greater proportion of sales of distributed brands  which have lower gross margins than owned and licensed brands 
for fiscal  our gross profit was reduced by approximately million and gross margin was reduced by percentage points due to the effect of high cost inventory purchased prior to the elizabeth arden acquisition 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due principally to additional advertising to support new product launches and higher incentive compensation costs 
these increases were partially offset by reduced expenses from management initiatives  including the restructuring of certain international operations  and reduction in selling overhead expenses  as well as benefits from favorable foreign currency rates 
the effect of foreign currency transaction gains contributed approximately million to the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects the leveraging of our cost structure and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased for fiscal  compared to fiscal  principally as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in adopting sfas no 
 we concluded that the elizabeth arden trademarks are considered indefinite lived assets and after january  are no longer being amortized 
amortization relating to these trademarks amounted to million for fiscal interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from reduced borrowings under our bank credit facility and lower interest rates paid on that debt 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
there was a provision for income taxes for fiscal  as compared to a benefit from income taxes for fiscal  reflecting higher operating earnings 
the effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of income loss before income taxes for fiscal  was versus in fiscal the increase over fiscal primarily reflects adjustments for foreign and state tax liabilities 
net income loss 
net income for fiscal increased million as compared to a net loss in fiscal the increase was a result of higher net sales and associated gross profit and lower depreciation and amortization  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate

the accretion and dividend on preferred stock was a non cash charge to net income attributable to common shareholders for fiscal and a non cash charge to net loss attributable to common shareholders for fiscal these amounts represent accretion on the fair value of  and the imputed dividends on  the series d convertible preferred stock issued to an affiliate of unilever as part of the purchase price for the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business 
net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
net income attributable to common shareholders increased million for fiscal  compared to a net loss in fiscal the net income or net loss attributable to common shareholders includes the net income or net loss plus accretion and dividends associated with the series d convertible preferred stock

ebitda increased by and ebitda margin increased basis points for fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase in ebitda and ebitda margin was the result of higher net sales and gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses

seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from our customers  sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  we expect to experience variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
we experience seasonality in our working capital  with peak inventory and receivable balances in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january of each year  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received 
liquidity and capital resources years ended january  amounts in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to inventory reduction initiatives  higher operating income before restructuring charges and lower interest expense 
accounts receivable at january  were above prior year levels primarily due to higher sales and the timing of those sales versus the prior year partially offset by improved cash collection efforts 
inventory levels at january  were lower than the prior year  as we focused on reducing our inventory levels  partially offset by incremental investment in additional distributed brands 
the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal was due to higher operating income and improved working capital utilization 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million in fiscal and increased million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal was primarily related to logo

we called for redemption the remaining million of senior notes in january and redeemed those notes in february pending the redemption of those notes  we used a portion of the proceeds from the senior subordinated notes offering to temporarily invest in short term securities 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments 
at january   our long term debt and financial obligations and commitments by due date were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total consists of purchase commitments for finished goods  raw materials  components  advertising  promotional items  insurance  services pursuant to legally binding obligations  including fixed or minimum obligations and estimates of such obligations subject to variable price provisions 
long term debt  including the current portion  was million at january  including million of senior notes that were redeemed on february  and million at january  in fiscal  we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  million of which were redeemed in november with the net proceeds from the equity offering of our common stock in october and million of which were redeemed with the net proceeds from the sale in january of million of logo 
table of contents senior subordinated notes 
the net proceeds of the issuance of the senior subordinated notes were also used to redeem million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes  of which million were redeemed in january we called for redemption the remaining million of senior notes on january  and redeemed those notes on february  as a result of this redemption  we will incur a charge in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately million due to the early extinguishment of these notes 
for more information on our long term debt  debt refinancing activities and contractual commitments  see notes  and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the fixed interest rate on million or approximately of our outstanding senior subordinated notes to a variable interest rate based on libor 
the swap agreement matures in february we can terminate the swap at our option at any time and the counter party can call the swap any time after january we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
future liquidity and capital needs 
our principal future uses of funds are for debt service  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
we have historically financed  and we expect to continue to finance  our needs primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
we collect cash from our customers based on our sales to them and their respective payment terms 
we have a revolving bank credit facility with a syndicate of banks that matures in january our borrowings under this facility are limited to a borrowing base  calculated based on of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories from november to april 
the borrowings are collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends and the incurrence of debt other than refinancing and certain small amounts of indebtedness 
the credit facility also has a requirement that we maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of if availability under the facility declines to less than million 
in addition  the indenture pursuant to which our senior subordinated notes are issued restricts the incurrence of debt other than refinancing indebtedness and certain other indebtedness and the payment of dividends subject to satisfaction of a fixed charge coverage ratio and net income tests 
on february   we executed an amendment to our credit facility 
this amendment included a reduction in the range of interest rates included in the applicable margin  which is added to either libor based rates or prime rates  at our option and based upon the amount of our outstanding loan balance that we have placed in libor and prime rate based loans 
the interest rates included in the applicable margin were reduced by to a range of to for libor loans and to a range of to for prime rate loans and are now based on a fixed charge coverage ratio instead of a ratio of consolidated debt to ebitda 
as of january   the applicable margin was for libor loans and for prime rate loans 
at february   the applicable margin was for libor loans and for prime rate loans 
the amendment also included a reduction in the lower end of the range of the commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility to a range of to per year based on a debt service ratio 
at march   the commitment fee was 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
based upon our internal projections  we believe that the credit facility  as currently amended and restated  provides sufficient flexibility so that we will remain in compliance with its terms 
if our actual results deviate significantly from our projections  however  we may not remain in compliance with the fixed charge covenant and would not be allowed to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  a default under our revolving credit facility that causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default on our notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our credit facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and million of availability  as well as million in cash and cash equivalents 
logo 
table of contents we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or new product distribution arrangements 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations

r  consolidation of variable interest entities forward looking information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans  assumptions and future events or performance 
we have tried  wherever possible  to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  will and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these include statements relating to future actions  prospective products  future performance or results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
the average of our month end borrowings during fiscal was million 
borrowings under our credit facility are seasonal  with peak borrowings in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to variable rates and  accordingly  our earnings and cash flow logo 
table of contents will be affected by changes in interest rates 
based upon our fiscal average borrowings under our credit facility  and assuming there had been a two percentage point change in the average interest rate for these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense for fiscal would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to swap million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes to a floating rate of interest based on libor to better balance our mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
in the short term  this will provide us with a lower level of interest expense related to a portion of the senior subordinated notes based on current libor rates  however  over the life of the notes  interest expense may be greater than based upon fluctuations in libor 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our results could be negatively affected 
we can terminate the swap at our option at any time and the counter party can call the swap any time after january we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
foreign currency risk we sell our products in approximately countries around the world 
for fiscal  we derived approximately of our net sales from our international operations 
we conduct our international operations in a variety of different countries and derive our sales in currencies including the euro  british pound  swiss franc  canadian dollar and australian dollar  as well as the us dollar 
our operations may be subject to volatility because of currency changes  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
with respect to international operations  our sales and expenses are typically denominated in local currency  while costs of goods sold are denominated in a combination of local currency and the us dollar 
our results of operations are reported in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency rates can affect our reported sales  margins  operating costs and the anticipated settlement of our foreign denominated receivables and payables 
most of our skincare and cosmetic products are produced in a manufacturing facility located in roanoke  virginia 
a weakening of the foreign currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated  which is primarily the us dollar  may decrease our reported cash flow and operating profits 
our competitors may or may not be subject to the same fluctuations in currency rates  and our competitive position could be affected by these changes 
as a result of favorable foreign currency rates relative to the us dollar during fiscal  we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of million compared to million in fiscal as a result of adverse foreign currency rates during fiscal  we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of million 
while we have engaged in a limited number of foreign currency hedging transactions for small amounts in fiscal  primarily option contracts to reduce the exposure of our earnings to fluctuations in currency rates  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities in fiscal we enter into foreign currency contracts to protect against the adverse effect that exchange rate fluctuations may have on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
any foreign currency contracts that we may enter into will likely qualify for hedge accounting and  therefore  the gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the contracts expire 
we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
there can be no assurance that our hedging operations  if any  will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
as of january   our subsidiaries outside the united states held approximately of our total assets 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is either the us dollar or the local currency 
the cumulative effect of translating balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the us dollar at current exchange rates is included in accumulated and other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets
