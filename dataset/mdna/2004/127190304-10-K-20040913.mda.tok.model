item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
all years refer to the company s fiscal year which ends on june critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract accounting the company generates its revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
the company considers fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion of the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost plus fee contracts that include performance based fee incentives  the company recognizes the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as the company s prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus allowable expenses incurred 
the company has four basic categories of fixed price contracts  fixed unit price  fixed price level of effort  fixed price completion  and fixed price license 
revenue on fixed unit price contracts  where specified units of output under service arrangements are delivered  is recognized as units are delivered based on the specified price per unit 
revenue on fixed unit price maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the service period 
revenue for fixed price level of effort contracts is recognized based upon the number of units of labor actually delivered multiplied by the agreed rate for each unit of labor 
a significant portion of the company s fixed price completion contracts involve the design and development of complex  client systems 
for these contracts that are within the scope of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of sop  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
the company s fixed price license agreements and related services contracts are primarily executed in its international operations 
as the agreements to deliver software require significant production  modification or customization of software  revenue is recognized using the contract accounting guidance of sop for agreements to deliver data under license and related services  revenue is recognized as the data is delivered and services are performed 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of allowable indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees for certain contracts are also a significant factor in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
products and services provided under long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
for our federal contracts  we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business operations personnel conduct thorough periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
stock based compensation the company currently accounts for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
alternative guidance exists under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires companies to determine the fair value of options at the time of grant and to recognize compensation expense over the service period 
if the company s employee stock based compensation transactions had been accounted for based on their fair value  as determined under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the pro forma earnings would have been as follows dollars in thousands  except per share amounts twelve months ended june reported net income stock based compensation costs included in reported net income  net of tax stock based compensation costs that would have been included in the determination of reported net income  if the fair value method was applied to all awards  net of tax pro forma net income basic earnings per share reported earnings per share stock based compensation costs net of tax pro forma earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported earnings per share stock based compensation costs net of tax pro forma earnings per share the fair value of each employee stock based compensation transaction is estimated on the grant date using a fair value option pricing model 
these pro forma results may not be indicative of the future results for the full fiscal year due to potential grants vesting and other factors 
investments in marketable securities the company invests in marketable securities  which are currently classified as available for sale or trading using the accounting guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as a result of this classification  unrealized gains and losses as a result of changes in fair value of the available for sale investments are recorded as a separate component within the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
if these securities were instead determined to be trading securities  any unrealized gains or losses would be reported in the consolidated statements of operations and therefore  would impact the net earnings currently being reported 
to date  we do not believe that a different classification would have had a significant impact on our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts management establishes bad debt reserves against certain billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectable 
whenever judgment is involved in determining the estimates  there is the potential for bad debt expense and the fair value of accounts receivable to be misstated 
given that we primarily serve the us government and that  in our opinion  we have sufficient controls in place to properly recognize revenue  we believe the risk to be relatively low that a misstatement of accounts receivable would have a material impact on our financial results 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue 
consolidated statements of operations years ended june    and dollars in thousands  except for the percentages year year to year change fy fy fy fy fy fy fy to fy fy to fy revenue cost expenses direct costs indirect costs selling expenses depreciation amortization total costs expenses income from operations interest expense income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations revenue 
the table below sets forth  for the periods indicated  the customer mix in revenue with related percentages of total revenue 
dollars in thousands years ended june  department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial state local government total for the year ended june   the company s total revenue increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue resulted from continuing growth in the company s systems integration  engineering services and knowledge management offerings of its domestic operations and the successful integration of four acquisitions that broadened the company s portfolio of solutions offerings 
this growth is a result of the company s strategic focus on national security  the global war on terrorism  and the reshaping of the way government agencies communicate  use and disseminate information  deliver services  and conduct business 
during fiscal year fy total revenue increased million  or 
the revenue growth was driven primarily by increased demand from federal government customers along with the company s on going acquisition efforts 
revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue growth 
the company s acquisitions accounted for million and million of the revenue growth for fy and fy  respectively  as follows business acquired ptg d ig c cubed cms acton burnell ats mtl condor dsic other total revenue from dod increased  or million  for fy as compared to fy the aforementioned acquisitions accounted for approximately of this growth  contributing million 
the company also continued to experience increased demand for mission critical support from customers such as strategic and tactical organizations in the military intelligence community  the u 
s army intelligence and security command  the us army s communications electronics command cecom  and the us navy s space and warfare command 
dod revenue growth in fy of  or million  was driven primarily by high demand from customers such as the defense information systems agency disa  cecom  and the intelligence community as well as the aforementioned acquisitions 
revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  or  for fy as compared to fy acquisitions accounted for approximately of this growth  contributing million in revenue 
approximately of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from doj  for whom the company provides litigation support services and maintains a debt collection system 
revenue from doj was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
in fy  doj accounted for  or million  of the revenue growth within federal civilian agencies 
the company also experienced increased revenue growth of  or million  from federal civilian agencies other than doj in fy as compared to fy the increase was primarily due to the higher volumes of work from customers such as the department of veterans affairs va  the social security administration and other federal civilian agencies 
in fy as compared to fy  revenue from federal civilian agencies increased or million 
this increase was primarily due to higher volumes of work from customers such as the va  the us customs services  and the national intelligence community  along with the aforementioned acquisitions 
commercial revenue increased  or million  in fy as compared to fy commercial revenue is derived from both international and domestic operations 
in fy  international operations accounted for  or million  of the total commercial revenue while the domestic operations accounted for  or million 
the increase in commercial revenue was primarily from the international operations within the united kingdom 
the uk business had increased sales on higher margin software and data products and also showed improvements in its commercial it service marketplace 
in fy  international operations accounted for  or million  of the total commercial revenue while the domestic operations accounted for  or million 
commercial revenue increased by  or million  in fy as compared to fy the entire growth of commercial revenue came from the domestic operations of the company and was due primarily to the condor acquisition 
revenue produced by international operations remained relatively flat in fy due to the continued weakness in the telecom and commercial it services industries within the uk 
revenue from state and local governments increased by  or million  to million for the year ended june  as compared to the same period a year ago 
almost half of this increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of acton burnell and cms 
in fy as compared to fy  revenue from state and local governments decreased slightly by  or million 
revenue from state and local governments represented and of the company s total revenue in fy and fy  respectively 
the company s continued and expanded focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities has resulted in a reduced emphasis on state and local governments business 
income from operations 
operating income increased  or million  in fy as compared to the same period a year ago 
operating margin in fy improved to from a year earlier 
the company s growth in operating margin was driven primarily by operational cost efficiencies  cost synergies associated with acquisitions and a favorable mix of business 
the acquisitions in fy described in item i were all immediately accretive to operating income 
in fy as compared to fy operating income increased  or million 
the company s growth in operating margin was accomplished by contract mix with more profitable fixed price and time and materials work 
internal growth was complimented by the company s acquisition activity during the year 
during the last three years  as a percentage of revenue  total direct costs were  and  respectively 
direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs such as equipment purchases  subcontract costs and travel expenses 
other direct costs are common in our industry  typically are incurred in response to specific client tasks and vary from period to period 
the largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor during the last three fiscal years is attributable to the internal growth in the company s federal government business both in the dod and federal civilian agencies as well as from the previously mentioned acquisition activities 
other direct costs were million  million and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the year over year increase was primarily the result of increased volume of tasking across system integration  knowledge management and engineering services including the aforementioned acquisitions 
indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
many of these expenses are highly variable and have grown in dollar volume generally in proportion to the growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  indirect costs and selling expenses were  and for fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the decrease in percentage from fy to fy is primarily from cost synergies associated with acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization increased  or million  in fy as compared to fy approximately  or million  of the increase was attributable to the intangible amortization of assets acquired in recent acquisitions  primarily that of the may  acquisition of the d ig and the may  acquisition of ptg 
the balance of the increase of approximately million was primarily for new capital expenditures and building improvements to support on going business 
in fy  as compared to fy  depreciation and amortization increased by  or million 
this increase was attributable to both assets acquired in acquisitions  and new capital expenditures to support on going business offset by lower software amortization 
for fy  the company incurred interest expense of million  compared to net interest income of million in fy the majority of this increase is for interest costs relating to the company s borrowings of million under its new secured credit facility which was used to finance the purchase of the d ig 
the company will be required to repay a minimum of million annually under the terms of its credit facility 
in fy  the company had interest income of million  compared to interest expense of million in fy this increase in income was attributable to the company having cash and equivalents and short term marketable securities averaging in excess of million during fy the cash was generated primarily from both the company s secondary offering in march and from operations 
prior to this offering  the company funded its operations and acquisitions with borrowings from its line of credit 
the cash and equivalents and short term marketable securities generated over million in interest income in fy the effective income tax rates in fy  fy and fy  were  and  respectively  which differed from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state and local income taxes and certain non deductible expenses 
quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
see note quarterly financial data unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation approximately of the company s business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
approximately of the business is under time and materials contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
the company generally has been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portion of the company s business is fixed price and may span multiple years 
however  these contracts are priced to account for likely inflation from period to period to mitigate the risk of our business being adversely affected by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs 
from march through the may acquisition of d ig  the proceeds from the company s march offering of approximately million shares of common stock were the company s principal source of liquidity and capital to fund business acquisitions 
in order to fund the acquisition of the d ig  which was purchased for million in cash plus transaction costs of approximately million  the company executed a new million credit facility  including both a revolving credit facility and institutional term loan 
total borrowings under the new credit facility were million of which million was outstanding at june  the new five year secured revolving credit agreement permits continuously renewable borrowings of up to million with annual sublimits on amounts borrowed for acquisitions 
the new agreement permits similar borrowings options and interest rates as those offered by the prior agreement 
the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the facility 
the institutional term loan is a year secured facility in the amount of million 
the principal is to be prepaid in years one through six with the remainder due on the maturity date 
interest rates are based on libor or the higher of the prime rate or fed funds rate plus applicable margins 
margin and unused fee rates are determined quarterly based on the leverage ratio 
the company is required to operate within certain limits on leverage  net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the total costs associated with securing the new credit facility were approximately million  which are being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
cash and equivalents and marketable securities were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the company s operating cash flow improved by million during the fourth quarter of fy  to million for fy as compared to million for the full year ended june  days sales outstanding dso increased to days in fy as compared to days at the end of fy this includes days of dso relating to the acquisition of the d ig 
cash flow from operations also was affected by increased dso in the first half of fy but improved significantly in the last six months of fy  when excluding the impact of acquisitions 
the company used million and million of cash in investing activities for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the cash used in both years was primarily in support of the company s on going business acquisition activities 
the company generated cash from financing activities of million during fy  as compared to using cash of million over the same period a year ago 
during fy  cash of million was provided by the company s new credit facility net of financing costs and repayments 
in fy  the company paid down its line of credit by million 
in both years the company generated additional cash primarily from the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock transactions 
the company entered into a letter of intent loi on march   which it has extended through october  to acquire all of the outstanding stock of an information technology services company that provides work for various agencies of the federal government  primarily within the department of defense 
the purchase price is expected to be approximately million 
the company is currently evaluating whether or not it will move forward with the acquisition 
if it chooses to move forward  the company will fund the acquisition with proceeds under its new credit facility described above 
the company also maintains a  pounds sterling unsecured line of credit in london  england which expires in december as of june   the company had no borrowings under this line of credit 
the company believes that the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of june  that require the company to make future cash payments amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term liabilities reflected on the registrants balance sheet under gaap other notes payable deferred compensation total amounts are included on the company s consolidated balance sheet at june  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters 
amounts are included on the company s consolidated balance sheet at june see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding lease commitments 
the liability is offset by investment assets held by the plan provider to be reimbursed to the company upon the distribution of the liability to the plan participant 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding deferred compensation 
forward looking statements there are statements made herein which may not address historical facts and  therefore  could be interpreted to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following we depend on contracts with the federal government for a substantial majority of our revenue  and our business could be seriously harmed if the government ceased doing business with us 
we derived of our total revenue in fy and of our total revenue in fy from federal government contracts  either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor 
we derived of our total revenue in fy and of our total revenue in fy from contracts with agencies of the dod 
we expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally  with the general services administration  or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the dod  or if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired  or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us  our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results could differ materially from those anticipated 
our business could be adversely affected by the outcome of the various investigations proceedings regarding our interrogation services work in iraq 
recent press accounts have reported that an internal government report  the taguba report  contains information regarding the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners 
the taguba report alleges that one caci employee was involved with the alleged mistreatment 
another government report  the jones fay report  alleges that three caci employees  including the one identified in the taguba report  acted improperly in performing their assigned duties in iraq 
the jones fay report recommended that the information in the report regarding each of the three caci interrogators be forwarded to the army general counsel for determination of whether each of them should be referred to the department of justice for prosecution  as well as forwarded to the contracting officer for appropriate contractual action 
the company s preliminary investigation into these matters already considered some of the allegations regarding the employees cited in the jones fay report  two of whom are no longer employed by caci 
that investigation  however  could not confirm the allegation of abuse contained in the jones fay report concerning one of the two former employees and reached a different conclusion than the jones fay report regarding the allegation that the other former employee placed a detainee in a stress position and permitted a photograph to be taken 
the third caci person named in the jones fay report  a current employee whose name was made public due to his implication in the illegally leaked taguba report  has been under careful consideration and review by the company since may despite attempts by counsel to obtain information from the government  to date  the company has not received any specific information confirming the allegations of wrongdoing made in the taguba report regarding the subject employee 
in fact  our investigation uncovered glowing testimonials to the high quality of his work from his supervisors and colleagues of his good services were noted and included recommendations from his superiors as well as colleagues 
the jones fay report contained other allegations not previously communicated to the company  which the company s investigation is now pursuing 
the company s preliminary investigation thus far has not produced information that supports these new jones fay report findings 
caci has and will continue to cooperate fully with the government regarding investigations arising out of the interrogation services provided in iraq 
in addition  caci received a letter from the general services administration suspension and debarment official expressing concern that the company may have misused a gsa schedule in connection with the contract to provide interrogation and affording caci an opportunity to provide information and argument as to why it should remain eligible for further us government contracts 
caci provided information and presented argument to gsa 
after review  gsa sent the company a letter stating that it was not necessary to take any formal action to protect the interests of the government ie gsa would not suspend or debar the company based on these matters 
in the letter  the suspension and debarment official informed us that he had provided the information to the gsa s attorneys for review and would let us know if additional information was needed 
gsa has not requested any further information 
caci has never condoned  and will never condone  tolerate or endorse any illegal or inappropriate behavior on the part of any employee when engaged in caci business but we will stand firmly by our employees and their right to be presumed innocent until there is verifiable information confirming that they have been involved in misconduct 
if and when the company receives verifiable information indicating any inappropriate or illegal behavior on the part of any employee  the company will take swift and appropriate action to redress the matter 
the results of the investigations and proceedings regarding our interrogation services in iraq could affect our relationships with our government clients and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government 
because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from contracts with the federal government  we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in federal government contract programs 
changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance 
a significant decline in government expenditures  or a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies  could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts 
any such actions could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
among the factors that could seriously affect our federal government contracting business are changes in federal government programs or requirements  budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending generally  or specific departments or agencies in particular  and changes in fiscal policies or available funding  including potential governmental shutdowns such as that which occurred during the government s fiscal year  an increase in set asides for small businesses that could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts  and curtailment of the federal government s use of technology solutions firms 
our federal government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government not to continue with contract performance  and  if lost contracts are not replaced  our operating results may differ materially from those anticipated 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from federal government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years 
the option periods typically cover more than half of the contract s potential duration 
federal government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option periods 
in addition  our contracts typically also contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for its convenience 
a decision not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls from those anticipated 
federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us 
federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies  some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts  including allowing the government to cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  claim rights in systems and software developed by us  suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency  impose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution  and control or prohibit the export of our data and technology 
if the government terminates a contract for convenience  we may recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination 
if the government terminates a contract for default  we may be unable to recover even those amounts  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
depending on the value of a contract  such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
as is common with government contractors  we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts 
certain contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that limit our ability to compete for certain related follow on contracts 
for example  when we work on the design of a particular system  we may be precluded from competing for the contract to install that system 
depending upon the value of the matters affected a performance problem or organizational conflict of interest issue that precludes our participation in a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies  our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected 
to facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid 
we may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies  and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we derive significant revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process 
if we are unable to consistently win new awards over any extended period  our business and prospects will be adversely affected 
substantially all of our contracts and task orders with the federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process 
we expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding 
recently  members of congress and administration officials have proposed changes to the procurement process intended to increase competition among suppliers to the federal government 
budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many federal government clients to increasingly purchase goods and services through id iq contracts  or gsa contracts  and other gwac contracts 
these contracts  some of which are awarded to multiple contractors  have increased competition and pricing pressure  requiring that we make sustained post award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract 
moreover  even if we are highly qualified to work on a particular new contract  we might not be awarded business because of the federal government s policy and practice of maintaining a diverse contracting base 
this competitive bidding process presents a number of risks  including the following we bid on programs before the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns  we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win  we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win  and we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding  and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications  or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 
if we are unable to win particular contracts  we may be foreclosed from providing to clients services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years 
if we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period  our business and prospects will be adversely affected and that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the client requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract  and the termination or non renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients 
many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education  work experience and security clearances 
depending on the level of clearance  security clearances can be difficult and time consuming to obtain 
if we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances  we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them 
to the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract  we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract  which could cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we must comply with a variety of laws and regulations  and our failure to comply could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business 
for example  the federal acquisition regulation and the industrial security regulations of the dod and related laws include provisions that allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership  control or influence  require us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information 
our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination  loss of security clearances  suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the federal government may reform its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us 
the federal government may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  such as cost accounting standards 
it could also adopt new contracting methods relating to gsa contracts or other government wide contracts  or adopt new socio economic requirements 
these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or win re competed contracts 
any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to satisfy  and  as a result could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
restrictions on or other changes to the federal government s use of service contracts may harm our operating results 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from service contracts with the federal government 
the government may face restrictions from new legislation  regulations or government union pressures  on the nature and amount of services the government may obtain from private contractors 
any reduction in the government s use of private contractors to provide federal services could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the federal government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 
federal government agencies  including the dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
these agencies review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
they also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
moreover  if any of the administrative processes and systems is found not to comply with requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
therefore  an unfavorable outcome to an audit by the dcaa or another government agency could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
if a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
each of these results could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue 
we derive substantial revenue from contracts in which we act as a subcontractor or from teaming arrangements in which we and other contractors bid on particular contracts or programs 
as a subcontractor or teammate  we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract  and poor performance on the contract could tarnish our reputation  even when we perform as required 
we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our revenue and operating results could differ materially from those anticipated if any prime contractor or teammate chose to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services 
we may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog  which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated 
our backlog consists of funded backlog  which is based on amounts actually obligated by a client for payment of goods and services  and unfunded backlog  which is based upon management s estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders  including options  to generate revenue 
our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period  or at all  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract 
for example  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from government contracts in which we are not the sole provider  meaning that the government could turn to other companies to fulfill the contract 
we also derive revenues from id iq contracts  which do not require the government to purchase a material amount of goods or services under the contract 
action by the government to obtain support from other contractors or failure of the government to order the quantity of work anticipated could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
without additional congressional appropriations  some of the contracts included in our backlog will remain unfunded  which could significantly harm our prospects 
although many of our federal government contracts require performance over a period of years  congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time 
as a result  our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term  and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency 
nevertheless  we estimate our share of the contract values  including values based on the assumed exercise of options relating to these contracts  in calculating the amount of our backlog 
because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract  our estimate of our backlog may be inaccurate and we may post results that differ materially from those anticipated 
employee misconduct  including security breaches  could result in the loss of clients and our suspension or disbarment from contracting with the federal government 
we may be unable to prevent our employees from engaging in misconduct  fraud or other improper activities that could adversely affect our business and reputation 
misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal government procurement regulations  regulations regarding the protection of classified information and legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts 
many of the systems we develop involve managing and protecting information involved in national security and other sensitive government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could prevent us from having access to such critically sensitive systems 
other examples of employee misconduct could include time card fraud and violations of the anti kickback act 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective  and we could face unknown risks or losses 
as a result of employee misconduct  we could face fines and penalties  loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our failure to attract and retain qualified employees  including our senior management team  could adversely affect our business 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to recruit and retain the technically skilled personnel we need to serve our clients effectively 
our business involves the development of tailored solutions for our clients  a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees 
accordingly  our employees are our most valuable resource 
competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense  and technology service companies often experience high attrition among their skilled employees 
there is a shortage of people capable of filling these positions and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources 
our failure to attract and retain technical personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations  reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our clients needs  limit our ability to win new business and cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel  we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully 
our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements in our industry  particularly with agencies performing classified operations 
the loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose client relationships or new business opportunities  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our markets are highly competitive  and many of the companies we compete against have substantially greater resources 
the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive 
many of our competitors may compete more effectively than we can because they are larger  better financed and better known companies than we are 
in order to stay competitive in our industry  we must also keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences 
if we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors  our revenue may decline 
in addition  our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 
as a result  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can 
there is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation  which may result in the emergence of companies who are better able to compete against us 
the results of these competitive pressures could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our quarterly revenue and operating results could be volatile 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future 
in particular  if the federal government does not adopt  or delays adoption of  a budget for each fiscal year beginning on october  or fails to pass a continuing resolution  federal agencies may be forced to suspend our contracts and delay the award of new and follow on contracts and orders due to a lack of funding 
further  the rate at which the federal government procures technology may be negatively affected following changes in presidential administrations and senior government officials 
therefore  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which in turn may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may also fluctuate due to impairment of goodwill charges required by recent changes in accounting standards 
we may lose money or generate less than anticipated profits if we do not accurately estimate the cost of an engagement which is conducted on a fixed price basis 
we perform a portion of our engagements on a fixed price basis 
we derived of our total revenue in fy and of our total revenue in fy from fixed price contracts 
fixed price contracts require us to price our contracts by predicting our expenditures in advance 
in addition  some of our engagements obligate us to provide ongoing maintenance and other supporting or ancillary services on a fixed price basis or with limitations on our ability to increase prices 
many of our engagements are also on a time and material basis 
while these types of contracts are generally subject to less uncertainty than fixed price contracts  to the extent that our actual labor costs are higher than the contract rates  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
when making proposals for engagements on a fixed price basis  we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the projects 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our capability to complete the task efficiently 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed price contracts  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 
from time to time  unexpected costs and unanticipated delays have caused us to incur losses on fixed price contracts  primarily in connection with state government clients 
on rare occasions  these losses have been significant 
in the event that we encounter such problems in the future  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs 
at june   our backlog included both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed price contracts 
our earnings and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
systems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
any systems failures  including network  software or hardware failures  whether caused by us  a third party service provider  unauthorized intruders and hackers  computer viruses  natural disasters  power shortages or terrorist attacks  could cause loss of data  interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients 
in addition  the failure or disruption of our mail  communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and  as a result  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the systems and networks that we maintain for our clients  although highly redundant in their design  could also fail 
if a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions  we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination 
our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and  as a result  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
we may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates 
one of our key growth strategies has been to selectively pursue acquisitions 
through acquisitions  we have expanded our base of federal government clients  increased the range of solutions we offer to our clients and deepened our penetration of existing clients 
we may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions 
without acquisitions  we may not grow as rapidly as the market expects  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy  including increased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions  our failure to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process  including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations  such as the federal acquisition regulation and health  safety and environmental laws  or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers  and acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
each of these types of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future 
the integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
these integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds  the transition to new information systems  coordination of geographically dispersed organizations  loss of key employees of acquired companies  and reconciliation of different corporate cultures 
for these or other reasons  we may be unable to retain key clients of acquired companies 
moreover  any acquired business may fail to generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost savings that we anticipated 
any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations  our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
our performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our clients 
a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies and or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor 
a subcontractor s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders 
depending upon the level of problem experienced  such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our business may be adversely affected if we cannot collect our receivables 
we depend on the collection of our receivables to generate cash flow  provide working capital  pay debt and continue our business operations 
if the federal government  any of our other clients or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of their outstanding invoices for any reason  our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the government may fail to pay outstanding invoices for a number of reasons  including lack of appropriated funds or lack of an approved budget 
some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly less financial resources than we do  which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or payment may be delayed 
if we experience difficulties collecting receivables it could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our global networks and other business commitments require our employees to travel to potentially dangerous places  which may result in injury or other negative impact to key employees 
our domestic business involves the maintenance of global networks and provision of other services that require us to dispatch employees to various countries around the world 
these countries may be experiencing political upheaval or unrest  and in some cases war or terrorism 
certain senior level employees or executives are  on occasion  part of the teams deployed to provide services in these countries 
as a result  it is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury or bodily harm  or be killed or kidnapped in the course of these deployments 
it is also possible that we will encounter unexpected costs in connection with the repatriation of our employees or executives for reasons beyond our control 
these problems could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
our failure to adequately protect our confidential information and proprietary rights may harm our competitive position 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property 
although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations  this protection may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our confidential information 
in addition  we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property in order to take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights  trademarks or other proprietary information  our competitive position could be harmed and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
we face additional risks which could harm our business because we have international operations 
our international operations consist of our uk based business which conducts the majority of its business in the united kingdom 
our international operations comprised approximately of our revenue in fy and of our revenue in fy our uk based operations are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country 
these risks include fluctuations in the value of the british pound  longer payment cycles  changes in foreign tax laws and regulations and unexpected legislative  regulatory  economic or political changes 
our uk based operations are also subject to risks associated with operating a commercial  as opposed to a government contracting  business  including the effects of general economic conditions in the united kingdom on the telecommunications  computer software and computer services sectors and the impact of more concentrated and intense competition for the reduced volume of work available in those sectors 
our revenue from this business grew during fy over revenue from such business in fy largely as a result of the slight recovery of the uk economy and the strengthening of the british pound 
while we are marketing our services to clients in industries that are new to us  our efforts in that regard may be unsuccessful 
other factors that may adversely affect our international operations are a continued decline in the economy of the united kingdom  difficulties relating to managing our business internationally  and multiple tax structures 
any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of june   we had investments in marketable securities valued at million 
all of these securities consisted of highly liquid investments that had remaining maturities of less than days at june  these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
hypothetically  a increase or decrease in market interest rates from the june  rates would not cause a material change in the value of these short term investments 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
as of june   we did not own any significant equity investments 
therefore  we did not have any material equity price risk 
the interest rates on both the institutional term loan and the revolving credit facility portion of the company s credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company has the ability to manage these fluctuations in part  through interest rate swaps 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in the company s interest expense fluctuating by approximately  for the year ended june  approximately and of the company s total revenues in fy and fy  respectively  were derived from customers of our international operations  primarily in the united kingdom 
the company s practice in its international operations is to negotiate contracts in the same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as of june  the company had approximately million in cash held in pounds sterling in the united kingdom 
this allows the company to better utilize its cash resources on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
