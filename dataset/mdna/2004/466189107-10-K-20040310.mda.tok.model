overview we are a multi channel specialty retailer of women s apparel  accessories and footwear 
we market our products through retail stores  catalogs and our website jjill 
com 
we currently have two reportable business segments  direct and retail 
each segment is separately managed and utilizes distinct distribution  marketing and inventory management strategies 
the direct segment markets merchandise through catalogs and our website 
the retail segment markets merchandise through retail stores 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
the months ended december  fiscal  december  fiscal and december  fiscal were week fiscal years 
during fiscal  we effected a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on june  to shareholders of record on june  all share and per share data has been adjusted for the stock split 
net sales for fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal income before interest and taxes for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal fiscal marked the beginning of an important transition for us 
in fiscal  we determined that our business had reached a level of growth and complexity that could no longer be adequately supported by the front end product development and merchandising infrastructure that had historically worked well in our catalog business 
we felt we needed an infrastructure that could support a more complex multi channel business 
consequently  we committed to make significant investments in both personnel and systems to re engineer and upgrade our operating infrastructure and processes in the areas of design  product management  sourcing  product integrity  technical design and merchandising 
we believe that these investments will allow us to fundamentally change the way we source and develop product  how we flow product  how we present product and the product itself 
during fiscal we worked to redefine our strategic objectives in the supply chain area and we began implementing the beginnings of a new front end product development and merchandising infrastructure 
during the latter half of the year we reorganized our entire product area 
as a result of our long inventory lead times  we believe that the impact of most of these changes will not be evident in our merchandise assortment until late in some of the changes we are in the process of making include  among other things  providing a more compelling product assortment to our current core customer and upgrades to fabrications  color  fit and overall quality 
we plan to reduce our style counts by roughly to for fall in an effort to provide a more focused collection and point of view for the j 
jill brand 
we also plan to define and support a core offering of products within our overall assortment that will be the foundation upon which our collections are built 
in  we are planning to spend approximately million to million on our front end product development and merchandising infrastructure 
this estimate is for only and does not include any future investments to be made beyond additionally  as we execute this strategy this estimate may change 
there can be no assurance that our investments will result in an improved infrastructure that will result in improved sales or profitability 
in order to mitigate our liquidity risk while we make these investments  we have decided to limit our store openings to and to reduce the number of pages in our catalogs by roughly as compared to fiscal we believe these steps are essential in order to lessen our short term risk as we make the necessary investment for our long term growth 
although we are unable to predict the impact that these changes may have  we anticipate that our net sales and net income may be adversely affected in the short term 
in july we merged our catalog internet subsidiary  j 
jill direct  inc  into our retail store subsidiary  the birch pond group  inc 
this restructuring provides us with enhanced customer service and cross channel marketing opportunities which allows us  among other things  to i promote our retail stores within our catalogs  ii distribute our catalogs in our retail stores  iii accept catalog and internet returns in our retail stores  iv offer the j 
jill credit card take program to our direct customers  v allocate our inventory more effectively across all three distribution channels  and vi develop a comprehensive  multi channel database of customer purchase information that will drive future cross channel marketing initiatives for catalog  internet and retail 
as a result of these changes  we are now required to collect sales tax on catalog and internet sales to customers in states where we have retail stores  if applicable 
although it is difficult to quantify the impact of this change  we believe the collection of sales taxes has not materially impacted our fiscal direct segment sales  nor do we expect it to have an adverse effect on sales in the future 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales twelve months ended december  december  december  net sales cost of products and merchandising gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses income before interest and taxes interest  net income before taxes income tax provision net income the following table summarizes net sales by segment in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  direct    retail    other   total net sales    other represents certain sales allowances not specifically attributable to the direct or retail business segments 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  retail segment net sales increased by to million from million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased store count 
retail segment sales productivity  as measured by sales per square foot  declined by during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we opened retail stores 
at december   we had retail stores open compared to at december  direct segment net sales decreased by and square inches circulated increased by during fiscal compared to fiscal direct segment sales productivity  as measured by net sales per  square inches circulated  declined by during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decreases in our sales productivity in the retail and direct segments during fiscal are primarily attributable to merchandising issues described in the overview 
internet net sales represented of total direct segment net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal we expect internet net sales to represent an increasing portion of our total direct business over time 
further  we expect our future growth to come from our retail segment 
gross margin represents net sales less cost of products and merchandising 
cost of products and merchandising consists primarily of merchandise development  sourcing  control and acquisition costs  provisions for markdowns  order processing and customer service costs  distribution facility costs and occupancy and depreciation costs for our stores 
during fiscal  our gross margin decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  our gross margin decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily as a result of increased off price selling in both segments and deeper discounts on markdown merchandise in our retail channel in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  higher markdown charges associated with increased overstocks and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales due to lower sales productivity in both segments also contributed to the decrease 
the effect of these factors was further exacerbated by the shift in the mix of the business toward retail and the fact that retail operating costs are higher as a percentage of net sales than direct operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs to produce  print and distribute catalogs  as well as website  retail store selling and corporate administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales productivity experienced in both the direct and retail segments as well as the shift in the mix of the business toward retail and the fact that retail segment selling expenses are higher as a percentage of net sales than direct segment selling expenses 
these factors were partially offset by lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales 
during fiscal  general and administrative expenses included two significant charges that were not repeated in fiscal these charges consisted of approximately million for costs incurred related to a potential strategic acquisition by us that was abandoned and a charge of million for a fully vested discretionary contribution into our deferred compensation plan 
however  during fiscal our spending on infrastructure investments  insurance and professional fees were higher than in fiscal interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income and interest expense resulted primarily from lower interest rates 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  retail segment net sales increased by to million from million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased store count 
retail segment sales productivity  as measured by sales per square foot  declined by during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline was as a result of several factors including a lower percentage of off price sales  lower overall in store inventory levels and the cannibalization impact of filling in markets 
during fiscal  we opened retail stores and one retail outlet store 
at december   we had retail stores open compared to at december  direct segment net sales increased by and square inches circulated increased by during fiscal compared to fiscal direct segment sales productivity  as measured by net sales per  square inches circulated  declined by during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to increased circulation levels and the disappointing results of our fall bestseller catalog  combined with a lower percentage of off price sales 
off price catalogs typically generate more sales per square inch circulated than full price catalogs 
additionally  both segments were negatively affected by the external pressures from the very difficult retail environment during the year 
internet net sales represented of total direct segment net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal during fiscal  our gross margin increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  our gross margin increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily as a result of our inventory management in fiscal our more conservative inventory management in fiscal resulted in fewer overstocks  less off price selling and lower markdown charges 
in addition  we were able to negotiate better prices with some of our vendors  which resulted in higher initial markups in fiscal as compared to fiscal finally  our gross margin also benefited from lower order processing costs as a percentage of net sales and the leveraging of these costs over higher total company net sales 
these factors were partially offset by the de leveraging of retail occupancy and depreciation costs associated with our retail store rollout as well as an  asset impairment charge relating to one of our retail stores taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales productivity experienced in both the direct and retail segments as well as the shift in the mix of the business toward retail and the fact that retail selling costs are higher as a percentage of net sales than direct selling costs 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include two significant charges during fiscal as described above 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income and interest expense resulted primarily from lower interest rates 
income taxes we provide for income taxes at an effective tax rate that includes the full federal and state statutory tax rates 
our effective tax rates for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  were  and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate includes a tax benefit as a result of the merger of two of our subsidiary companies described in the overview 
once this merger was effected  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize certain state net operating loss nol carryforwards that we had previously believed were not realizable 
this determination resulted in a reversal of the valuation allowance associated with these now realizable state nol carryforwards 
the valuation allowance had been established at december  for  in addition  our deferred state tax rate decreased as a result of apportioning more income to states with lower tax rates 
the effect of these changes on the current and deferred tax provision was a net tax benefit of approximately  realized in fiscal the decline in our effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects a decrease in the projected amount of non deductible expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offset by the reversal of the previously established valuation allowance and the impact of conducting business in states with higher tax rates 
our effective tax rate for is estimated to be 
segment direct contribution we currently have two reportable business segments  direct and retail 
segment reporting is intended to give financial statement users a view of our business through the eyes of management 
our internal management reporting is the basis for the information disclosed for our business segments 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  our internally defined measure of segment profit or loss  direct contribution  is required to be disclosed but is not a gaap measure 
as such  information related to segment direct contribution should be read in conjunction with the reconciliation to income before interest and taxes as determined by gaap 
we evaluate our segment profitability based on the direct contribution of each segment 
direct contribution represents each segment s net sales less direct costs related to the segment s operations 
direct costs for both segments include merchandise acquisition and control costs and provisions for markdowns 
direct costs also include catalog costs  certain order processing costs and internet selling costs for the direct segment and retail store selling  occupancy  depreciation and administrative costs for the retail segment 
direct contribution less unallocated shared service costs and general and administrative expenses is equal to income before interest and taxes 
unallocated shared service costs include distribution and warehousing costs as well as merchandising  sourcing and product development costs 
general and administrative expenses include corporate executive management costs  support service costs eg  shared information systems  finance and human resources and corporate headquarter occupancy costs 
the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  inter segment balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the following table summarizes direct contribution by segment and provides a reconciliation of segment direct contribution to income before interest and taxes in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  direct    retail    total direct contribution    unallocated shared service costs    general and administrative expenses    income before interest and taxes    direct segment the direct segment s fiscal direct contribution decreased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal this decrease in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales productivity  which resulted in higher selling expenses as a percentage of net sales 
in addition  the direct segment experienced lower gross margins in fiscal as a result of higher markdown charges and an increase in off price sales as compared to fiscal the direct segment s fiscal direct contribution increased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to higher gross margins associated with increased full price sales volumes  better inventory management  lower markdown charges and higher initial markups as compared to fiscal this gross margin improvement was partially offset by higher selling expenses as a percentage of segment net sales as a result of lower catalog productivity 
retail segment the retail segment s fiscal direct contribution decreased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal this decrease in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to lower gross margins associated with higher markdown charges  increased off price sales and deeper discounts taken on markdown merchandise in fiscal as compared to fiscal the retail segment s fiscal direct contribution increased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to higher gross margins associated with increased full price sales volumes  better inventory management  lower markdown charges and higher initial markups as compared to fiscal the gross margin improvement was partially offset by the higher occupancy  depreciation and selling costs as a percentage of segment net sales as a result of lower sales productivity  as well as an  asset impairment charge relating to one of our retail stores taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal seasonality and quarterly fluctuations as our retail segment becomes a greater portion of our overall business  we expect that our business will become more seasonal 
our retail store rollout plan is expected to materially impact year over year comparisons of our net sales 
also  january is included in the first fiscal quarter for us  but is included in the fourth fiscal quarter for many other retailers 
because january is a month that traditionally involves significant promotional pricing  this difference needs to be taken into account when making comparisons of our financial performance for interim periods with that of other retailers 
liquidity and capital resources our principal working capital needs arise from the need to support costs incurred in advance of revenue generation  primarily inventory acquisition and catalog development  production and mailing costs 
we have two selling seasons that correspond to the fashion seasons 
the spring season begins in january and ends in july 
the fall season begins in july and ends in january 
our capital investment needs arise from initiatives intended to support our growth  including the retail store rollout and improvements to our physical and operating infrastructure 
during fiscal  we funded our working capital and capital investment needs with cash generated from operations and our cash on hand 
cash and cash equivalents cash increased by million during fiscal approximately million in cash was generated from operations  million was invested in property and equipment  primarily related to our retail store rollout  and million was used to pay down debt 
during fiscal  net income before depreciation and amortization  additional deferred credits from landlords and decreases in inventory were the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities 
the primary use of cash in operating activities was increases in other assets  primarily as a result of prepaid income taxes 
cash increased by million during fiscal approximately million in cash was generated from operations and million from stock transactions 
approximately million was invested in property and equipment  primarily related to our retail store rollout  million was transferred to a trust associated with our deferred compensation plan and million was used to pay down debt 
during fiscal  net income before depreciation and amortization  additional deferred credits from landlords and higher accrued expense balances were the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities 
the primary use of cash in operating activities was increases in accounts receivable  principally associated with our deferred billing program 
accounts receivable balances at december  were or million lower than at december   primarily as a result of lower deferred billing amounts outstanding due to changes in the year over year timing and extent of our holiday deferred billing program 
inventory balances at december  were or million lower than at december   primarily as a result of lower current fall season and upcoming spring season inventory balances on hand at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal year end 
however  these decreases were somewhat offset by higher amounts of prior season inventory on hand at december  than at december  this increase in the level of older inventory on hand resulted from increased inventory levels intended to decrease missed sales opportunities  coupled with lower than expected sales 
we plan to liquidate this incremental inventory through direct segment liquidation vehicles eg  clearance catalogs  package inserts and promotional e mails  through our outlet stores and through inventory liquidators 
at december   we had accrued markdown reserves in order to value this inventory at the lower of cost or market 
retail segment inventory totaled million at december  compared to million at december  direct segment inventory totaled million at december  compared to million at december  property and equipment at december  was or million higher than at december   primarily as a result of our retail store rollout 
accounts payable balances at december  were or million higher than at december   primarily as a result of the growth in our retail segment 
accrued expense balances at december  were or million higher than at december   primarily as a result of higher accrued amounts relating to the growth of the business and outstanding gift certificates 
these amounts were partially offset by lower amounts due for taxes 
deferred credits from landlords and other consists primarily of step rent and allowances from landlords related to our retail store leases 
deferred credits from landlords and other at december  was or million higher than at december   primarily as a result of the additional retail stores opened since that date 
at december   we had retail stores and four outlet stores open 
we expect to open additional retail stores in the cash requirements related to our retail store initiative are significant and are primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  net of landlord allowances  and initial inventory acquisition costs 
construction commitments are typically made one to six months in advance of a new retail store opening 
the initial net cash requirements for opening a new retail store are currently estimated at an average of approximately  per store 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  aggregated by type  at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     long term debt obligations    inventory purchase obligations   non inventory purchase obligations    total      see note k to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see note e to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
represents amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms at december  represents amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms at december  amounts include  but are not limited to  obligations relating to retail store construction or other property and equipment  obligations relating to goods or services ordered in the ordinary course of business  obligations arising as a result of minimum service level provisions in certain contracts  obligations where an early termination penalty might be assessed in the event of early termination of the contract and obligations under employment agreements 
contingent obligations  such as amounts that might become due under the change in control severance arrangements with our executive officers or amounts that may become due under contracts or open purchase orders depending on future period volume  are not included in the table 
most of our retail store leases contain provisions that allow for early termination of the lease by either party if certain predetermined annual sales levels are not met 
generally  these provisions allow the lease to be terminated between the third and fifth year of the lease 
should the lease be terminated under these provisions  the unamortized portion of any landlord allowances related to that property would be payable to the landlord 
unamortized landlord allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these amounts have been excluded from the above table but included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at december   the maximum amount of future minimum lease payments for operating leases in any year was million in our credit facilities at december  consisted of i a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  ii a million real estate loan the tilton facility loan  and iii a million equipment loan the equipment loan 
on june   we amended the revolving credit facility primarily to extend its term  increase its letter of credit capacity and remove a prior borrowing restriction 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility  as amended  is june  the amount of the revolving credit facility  as amended  was increased from million to million  providing us with an additional million in letter of credit capacity 
letters of credit are primarily used to procure inventory from foreign vendors 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
outstanding borrowings may not exceed million 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property  both tangible and intangible 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate announced by one of the participating banks or the libor lending rate plus per annum 
at december   the revolving credit facility bore interest at per annum 
there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility at december  or december  the maximum borrowed amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility during fiscal and fiscal was and million  respectively 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
availability under the revolving credit facility at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  subject in each case to the applicable borrowing cap 
outstanding letters of credit do not bear interest 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the tilton facility loan is collateralized by a mortgage lien on our operations  fulfillment and distribution center in tilton  new hampshire the tilton facility 
the tilton facility is owned by birch pond realty corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the j 
jill group  inc  and leased to the j 
jill group  inc payments of principal and interest on the tilton facility loan  a year loan  are due monthly  based on a year amortization  with a balloon payment of the remaining balance payable on april  the interest rate on the tilton facility loan is fixed at per annum 
the equipment loan is collateralized by substantially all of our materials handling equipment 
on may   we refinanced the promissory notes outstanding under the equipment loan in order to reduce the weighted average interest rate of the equipment loan 
payments of principal and interest on the equipment loan  as amended  are due monthly with a balloon payment on the remaining balance payable on june  the interest rate on the equipment loan is fixed at per annum 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under our credit facilities during fiscal was per annum 
as previously mentioned  we have begun the process of re engineering and upgrading our front end product development and merchandising infrastructure 
this strategy will require us to invest cash in advance of receiving economic benefit 
we currently estimate the impact of these investments on cash to be approximately million to million 
we cannot assure that this investment will have a positive economic impact in the future 
in order to mitigate our liquidity risk while we make these investments  we have decided to limit our store openings to and to reduce the number of pages in our catalogs by roughly as compared to fiscal our sources of cash include cash on hand of million  available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million and anticipated cash flow from operations 
our principal uses of cash include cash required to support current operations as well as investments in infrastructure and our retail store rollout 
we estimate that approximately million in cash  before landlord allowances  will be invested in property and equipment during  primarily for retail store construction 
based on current operating conditions  we believe we have sufficient sources of cash to execute our operating plans in and fund our investments in infrastructure 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  we believe we have some flexibility to adjust our mid to long term operating plans with regards to our retail store rollout and our circulation strategy 
in addition  we also have unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we currently expect to end with at least million in cash 
critical accounting policies in the normal course of business  we provide for markdowns on our overstocked merchandise 
we look at past and projected sales performance and inventory on hand and on order when calculating an expected level of overstocks 
based on the estimated level of overstocks and the estimated net realizable amount of the overstocks  we accrue a markdown provision and maintain markdown reserves in order to state our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we have internal and external liquidation vehicles that we utilize to liquidate our overstocks 
internal channels  including sales catalogs  price reductions in the retail stores and our four outlet stores generally require lower markdown provisions and are considered first 
after the internal capacity is exceeded  external channels are considered 
external channels include discount marketers and inventory liquidators 
the amount of markdown provision is usually greater for external channels 
if our estimate of required markdown reserves is not accurate our gross margin and inventory balances may be overstated or understated 
we record accruals for estimated product returns for direct segment sales using the following process 
first  we determine an appropriate return rate for each current catalog 
in doing so  we consider a number of factors  including prior years and prior seasons return rates for comparable j 
jill catalogs and internet offerings  trends in return rates from season to season and within the current season and applicable operational factors 
once a return rate is determined  it is monitored and updated periodically as appropriate to reflect changes in underlying assumptions based on actual experience 
the return rate is used to calculate an appropriate returns allowance for the applicable catalog or internet offering for the applicable period 
we also provide a returns allowance for our retail stores 
we provide this allowance based on projected merchandise returns  taking into consideration historical experience and other factors 
these returns allowances are recorded as a reduction to net sales for the estimated retail value of the projected merchandise returns and as a reduction to cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
if our estimated returns allowance is not accurate  our returns reserves may be understated or overstated  resulting in an overstatement or understatement  respectively  of sales and earnings 
we incur costs to produce  print and distribute our catalogs 
catalog costs are considered direct response advertising and as such are capitalized as incurred and amortized over the expected sales life of each catalog  which is generally a period not exceeding six months 
creative costs for a season  which will benefit multiple catalogs  are allocated to each catalog taking into consideration relative catalog size and circulation 
the amortization of our catalog costs is meant to match revenues with expenses 
the expected sales life of each catalog is determined based on a detailed marketing forecast  which considers historical experience for similar catalogs as well as current sales trends 
these forecasts are updated frequently during the most active period of selling for each catalog to determine the expected future life of the catalog 
we monitor changes to the forecast and adjust the amortization period accordingly 
if our calculation of the amortization period is incorrect  this could result in a mismatch of revenue and expenses in a particular period 
recent accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and is effective for all financial instruments entered into after may  and otherwise is effective in the first interim period beginning after june  our adoption of the provisions of sfas had no material impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights 
such entities are known as variable interest entities 
our adoption of the provisions of fin had no material impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued a final consensus on issue eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  companies may also elect to apply the provisions of eitf to existing arrangements and record the income statement impact as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
our adoption of the provisions of eitf had no material impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
however  future sales promotions may require the deferral of revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our objective in managing our long term exposure to interest rate changes and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the material impact of the changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we periodically identify these risks and manage them through our regular operating and financing activities  including periodic refinancing of debt obligations to increase availability while minimizing financing costs and considering fixed and variable rate debt positions 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we have calculated the effect of a change in interest rates over a month and determined the effect to be immaterial 
we do not foresee or expect any significant changes in the management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the near future 
we have established a trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan 
the trust assets are invested in corporate owned life insurance in a manner that is designed to approximate the measurement designations of the plan participants  for both vested and unvested balances 
investments are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
due to the level of risk associated with certain investments  it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of these investments will occur in the near term and that such changes will also impact participant deferred compensation balances based on the measurement designations made by the participant 
changes in value of the trust assets are intended to mirror changes in the value of the participants deferred compensation accounts
