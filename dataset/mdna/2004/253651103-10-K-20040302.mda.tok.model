critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management of the company uses historical information and all available information to make these estimates and assumptions 
actual amounts could differ from these estimates and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies  its policies concerning revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  inventories  goodwill  and pensions and postretirement benefits are the most critical because they are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates 
additional information regarding these policies is included below 
revenue recognition the company enters into contracts to sell its products and services 
revenue is recognized on financial self service and security product sales in accordance with the terms of the contract  contingent upon customer acceptance and transferring risk of loss 
service revenue is recognized when earned  which is defined as when the work is completed or in the case of service contracts  ratably over the contract period 
election systems contracts contain multiple deliverable elements and custom terms and conditions 
the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
some contracts may contain discounts 
table of contents and  as such  revenue is recognized using the relative fair value method of allocation of revenue to the product and service components of contracts 
allowance for bad debts and credit risk the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a number of criteria 
a percentage of sales is reserved for uncollectible accounts as sales occur throughout the year 
this percentage is based on historical loss experience and current trends 
this estimate is periodically adjusted for known events such as specific customer circumstances and changes in the aging of accounts receivable balances 
since the company s receivable balance is concentrated primarily in the financial and government sectors  an economic downturn in these sectors could result in higher than expected credit losses 
inventories inventories are valued at lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews the inventory quantities on hand  identifies any slow moving or obsolete inventories and writes inventory down to its net realizable value 
historically  inventory adjustments have not been material 
however  in  a special charge of  was recorded to reflect discontinued products written down as a result of a rebalancing of the company s global manufacturing strategy 
the company s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence given the current product mix  however  new technologies and competition in certain product markets could change future assumptions relating to excess and obsolete inventory 
goodwill effective january   the company tests all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment using the fair value approach on a reporting unit basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s reporting units are defined as domestic and canada  brazil  latin america  asia pacific  and europe  middle east and africa emea 
fair values of reporting units and the related implied fair values of their respective goodwill were established using discounted cash flows 
when available and as appropriate  comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows 
the company s fair value model uses inputs such as estimated future segment performance and other significant estimates 
the company uses the most current information available and performs the annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter each year 
however  actual circumstances could differ significantly from assumptions and estimates made and could result in future goodwill impairment 
pensions and postretirement benefits the postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates 
for  medical cost trend rates were projected at percent and prescription drug cost trend rates were projected at percent  with both cost trend rate assumptions gradually declining to percent by and remaining at that level thereafter 
annually  the company analyzes its key assumptions related to its pension plans 
key assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the compensation levels 
such factors as financial market performance and actual compensation levels are considered when analyzing the key assumptions 
the company s key assumptions related to its pension plans for are as follows long term rate of return on plan assets of percent  discount rate of percent  and  compensation level increase of percent 
based on the above assumptions  the company expects pension expense to increase by approximately  in  increasing from approximately  in to approximately  in changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions could result in changes in the related retirement benefit cost and obligation 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point one percentage point increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation the company s pension plans remain adequately funded and the company is not required to make any additional contributions in pension expense excludes retiree medical expense  which is also included in operating expenses and was approximately  in retiree medical expense is expected to be approximately  in liquidity and capital resources capital resources are obtained from income retained in the business  borrowings under the company s committed and uncommitted credit facilities  long term industrial revenue bonds  and operating and capital leasing arrangements
