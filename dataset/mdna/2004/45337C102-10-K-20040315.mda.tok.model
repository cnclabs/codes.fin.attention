item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview incyte is focused on the discovery and development of novel  small molecule drugs to treat major medical conditions  including the infection with human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  inflammatory disorders  cancer and diabetes 
we are using our expertise in medicinal chemistry  and molecular  cellular and in vivo biology to discover and develop novel drugs 
our most advanced product candidate  reverset  is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor  or nrti  that is being developed as a once a day oral therapy for use in combination with other antiviral drugs for patients with hiv infections 
reverset is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
in addition to our reverset development program  we currently have four internally generated drug discovery programs underway 
the most advanced of these programs is focused on developing antagonists to a key receptor involved in inflammation called the ccr receptor  and the lead candidate from this program is expected to enter clinical trials in the first half of we believe that this class of compounds may have application in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis 
we also possess an extensive gene related intellectual property portfolio and a biological research information product line based in beverly  massachusetts 
we were founded and incorporated in delaware in and have focused our resources on biotechnology drug discovery and development 
we initially focused on proteins and protein therapeutics 
over the years  we evolved to a very early stage research and associated services company generating information associated with target identification and validation 
we are now focused on drug discovery and development with particular emphasis for small molecules 
until  we devoted substantially all of our resources to the development  marketing and sales of genomics technologies and products to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and research and academic institutions to aid in better and faster prevention  diagnosis and treatment of disease 
our products and services included databases  bioreagents  custom sequencing  gene expression  single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp  discovery  and other services 
over time  we also increased our investments in growing our intellectual property estate to protect our proprietary information as well as our internal and collaborative efforts to identify and validate drug targets 
during  we increased our focus on our internal drug discovery and development programs  and we exited the following activities microarray products and related services  genomic screening products and services  public domain clone products and related services  contract sequencing services  transgenic products and services and snp discovery services 
our information products included databases  intellectual property licensing  funded research and cdna clones 
the fees and the period of access to our database information were negotiated independently with each customer 
fees paid by customers for our information products also generally consisted of non exclusive or exclusive fees corresponding to patent rights on proprietary genes and proteins 
under our agreements with our database customers  we may also receive future milestone and royalty payments from the development and sale of their products derived from our technology and database information 
in february  we announced that  effective april  we will close our information products research facility and headquarters in palo alto  california and move our headquarters to our wilmington  delaware pharmaceutical research and development facilities 
the closure of the palo alto facility will correspond with terminating further development activities around our palo alto based information products  lifeseq and zooseq 
revenues for these products have been declining in recent years due to consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors as well as a challenging economic environment that led to reduced demand of research tools and services 
these trends  together with the public availability of genomic information  significantly reduced the market for  and revenues from  our palo alto based information products 
however  we will continue to offer pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academics our bioknowledge library  or bkl  product line 
bkl contains biological information about proteins in humans and key research model organisms  which has been summarized and curated from the scientific literature by experts in relevant biological disciplines 
we also intend to retain our extensive gene and genomic technology related intellectual property portfolio 
through our contractual arrangements with our database customers  we have established a substantial number of licensing arrangements involving elements of this portfolio  and we intend to continue to pursue further licensing agreements and other leveraging opportunities for this asset 
as a result of the closure of our palo alto operations  we estimate that we will record up to million in restructuring and related charges in  including charges related to the closure of our palo alto facilities  previously capitalized tenant improvements and equipment purchases  a workforce reduction and other items 
these charges would be in addition to charges of million recorded in the fourth quarter of in connection with our earlier decision to reduce certain headcount and write down certain assets related to our genomic information business 
we estimate that the cash impact in from restructuring related charges is expected to be up to million 
in conjunction with the restructuring program  we expect to reduce certain annual operating expenses of up to million through a combination of decreased spending  personnel reductions and office consolidations 
the restructuring programs will have no impact on our drug discovery and development programs as we intend to continue to invest in research and development related to these efforts 
we expect these research and development expenses to continue to increase in and will partially offset our expected expense reductions from the restructuring program 
we expect our total research and development expense to range from to million in of this amount  we expect our drug discovery and development expenses to total approximately million  which do not include any purchased in processed research and development costs 
also included in our overall research and development expenses are up to million in costs related to our information product line  which primarily includes first quarter activities and up to million in costs related to our intellectual property and bkl product line 
we anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs 
we also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
we do not expect to generate revenues from our drug discovery and development efforts for several years  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
prior restructurings during  and  we reported charges of million  million and million  respectively  relating to restructuring programs and long lived asset write downs incurred in the fourth quarter of each year 
a discussion of each of our restructuring programs follows during  we exited certain product lines and  as a result of exiting these activities  we closed certain of our facilities in fremont  california  palo alto  california  st 
louis  missouri and cambridge  united kingdom 
in addition to the product lines exited  we made infrastructure and other personnel reductions at our locations  resulting in an aggregate workforce reduction of approximately employees 
a charge for the restructuring program and impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of this change in focus 
this charge was comprised of the following items million goodwill and intangibles impairment  million restructuring charges including million in equipment and other assets impaired and million impairment of a long lived asset 
revenues from exited product lines for the years ended and were million and million  respectively 
additional charges for restructuring expenses of million and million were recorded in and respectively  primarily for contract related settlements  revised impairment estimates for long lived assets and facilities lease expenses in excess of estimated amounts  offset by the release of other restructuring accruals in excess of actual expenses 
in  we announced plans to reduce our expenditures  primarily in research and development  through a combination of spending reductions  workforce reductions and office consolidations 
the expense reduction plan included elimination of approximately of our workforce in palo alto  california  beverly  massachusetts  and cambridge  england and consolidation of our office and research facilities in palo alto  california 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million during the fourth quarter of in  we recorded an additional charge of million related to this restructuring  primarily relating to facilities lease expenses in excess of amounts originally estimated 
in  as a result of a restructuring decision made in the fourth quarter  we incurred an additional charge of million 
the restructuring plan included elimination of approximately employees at our palo alto location and write down of certain assets related to our genomic information product line 
acquisition of maxia in february  we completed the acquisition of maxia pharmaceuticals  inc maxia  a privately held drug discovery and development company that specialized in small molecule drugs targeting diabetes and other metabolic disorders  cancer  inflammatory diseases and heart disease 
we acquired maxia to create a more advanced and robust pipeline of discovery projects and product candidates and to further our drug discovery and development efforts 
the total purchase price was approximately million  consisting of incyte common stock and cash 
the purchase price was allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date and to in process research and development expense 
tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of cash of million  prepaid expenses of million  accounts payable of million and accrued liabilities of million 
we recorded a charge of million at the time of acquisition for the purchase of in process research and development expense iprd that is presented as a separate component of operating expenses  the valuation represents the estimated fair value of incomplete projects that  at the time of acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
incyte acquired three iprd compounds that are in stages ranging from discovery to preclinical phases  management has determined that each of these projects would require significant further development  including the receipt of marketing approval by the us food and drug administration fda or an equivalent foreign agency  before they would be commercially available 
pharamasset collaborative licensing agreement in september  we entered into a collaborative licensing agreement with pharmasset  ltd 
pharmasset to develop and commercialize reverset  an antiretroviral drug that is currently in phase ii clinical development for the treatment of hiv 
under the terms of the agreement we paid pharmasset million  which we recorded as a charge to purchased in process research and development expense that is presented as a separate component of operating expenses 
in addition to this one time payment  we also agreed to pay pharmasset certain future performance milestone payments and future royalties on net sales  in exchange for exclusive rights in the united states  europe and certain other markets to develop  manufacture and market the drug 
pharmasset will retain marketing and commercialization rights in certain territories  including south america  mexico  africa  the middle east and china 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition valuation of long lived assets accounting for long term investments restructuring charges revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in connection with our information products line  we enter into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual property 
in connection with our custom genomics products  which we exited in the fourth quarter of  we also entered into agreements for sales of our custom products and services 
revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist 
we exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the customer s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer 
revenues from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period 
revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received  based on information provided by the third party licensee 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
revenues from custom products  such as clones and datasets  were recognized upon completion and delivery 
revenues recognized from multiple element contracts are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual element by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
in arrangements with multiple elements  there may be significant judgment in separating the different revenue generating activities and in determining whether each is a separate earnings process 
when contracts include non monetary payments  the value of the non monetary transaction is determined using the fair value of the products and services involved  as applicable 
for non monetary payments involving the receipt of equity in a public entity  the fair value is based on the traded stock price on the date revenue is earned 
for non monetary payments involving the receipt of equity in a privately held company  fair value is determined either based on a current or recent arm s length financing by the issuer or upon an independent valuation of the issuer 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board issued eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
eitf became effective for revenue arrangements we entered into after june  the application of eitf did not have a material impact to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the year ended december  valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which includes property and equipment as well as intangible and other assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could indicate the need for an impairment review include the following significant changes in the strategy of our overall business  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  we measure the impairment based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value 
accounting for long term investments 
we monitor our investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
as of december   our long term investments consisted of equity investments in privately held companies 
many of these companies are still in the start up or development stage 
our investments in these companies are inherently risky because the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never become successful 
investments in publicly traded companies are classified as available for sale and are adjusted to their fair value each period based on their traded market price with any adjustments being recorded in other comprehensive income 
investments in privately held companies are carried at cost 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe that the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors by members of senior management 
generally  declines that persist for six months or more are considered other than temporary 
we use the best information available in these assessments  however  the information available may be limited 
these determinations involve significant management judgment  and actual amounts realized for any specific investment may differ from the recorded values 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional impairment charges 
restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
the restructuring charges resulting from the and restructuring programs have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab 
restructuring costs resulting from the maxia acquisition have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf 
the restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities  reduce our workforce  write off fixed assets  and pay for outside services incurred in the restructuring 
the workforce reduction charge is determined based on the estimated severance and fringe benefit charge for identified employees 
in calculating the cost to exit the facilities  we estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  the amount  if any  of sublease receipts and real estate broker fees 
this requires us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we perform an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
we also estimate our risk free interest rate in order to discount our projected lease payments in accordance with sfas estimates are also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held for sale 
these estimates are formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  the offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
our estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans 
for certain facilities that we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions such as higher than expected vacancy rates and lower sublease rates  we periodically evaluate current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary 
we also make adjustments related to professional fees due to actual amounts being lower than originally estimated 
during  such adjustments were made for the and restructuring 
results of operations we recorded net losses for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues in millions information products custom genomics total net revenue revenues were derived primarily from information products  which included licensing of our intellectual property  and custom genomics products 
information products include database subscriptions  licensing of our intellectual property  and partner programs and represented   and of total net revenues in   and  respectively 
custom genomics includes microarray based gene expression products and services  genomic screening products and services  public domain clone products and related services  contract sequencing and snp discovery services and represented   and of total net revenues in   and  respectively 
we announced our exit from our custom genomics product line in the fourth quarter of the decrease in revenues in over  and over  reflects a softening in the market for genomic information  a reduction in research spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies due in part to consolidations within these industries and their efforts to reduce spending  and the accompanying impact on renewals and the price of  and the length of contractual commitment for  our information products 
our database subscription and licensing revenues have been adversely impacted as customers have been more cautious with their spending than in the past 
for the years ended december    and  revenues from companies considered to be related parties  as defined by fasb statement no 
 related party disclosures sfas were million  million  and million 
our related parties consist of companies in which members of our board of directors have invested  either directly or indirectly  or in which a member of our board of directors is an officer or holds a seat on the board of directors other than an incyte held board seat 
revenues received from agreements in which customers paid with equity or debt instruments in their company were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
additionally  revenues received from agreements in which we concurrently invested funds in the customer s equity securities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
revenues recognized from transactions in which there was originally a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or services from the other party to the transaction for the years ended december    and were million  million and million  respectively 
no transactions in which we had a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or services from the other party to the transaction were entered into during the year ended december  of commitments made in prior periods  we expensed million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the above transactions were recorded at fair value in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we expect that revenues generated from information products  including licensing of intellectual property  will continue to decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs 
we expect that revenues from information products in will be significantly less than and will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us 
operating expenses total costs and expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million and million  respectively 
in conjunction with the restructuring program  we estimate that we will record up to million in restructuring and related charges in  including charges related to the closure of our palo alto facilities  previously capitalized tenant improvements and equipment purchases  a workforce reduction and other items 
as a result of the restructuring program  we expect to reduce certain annual operating expenses by up to million through a combination of decreased spending  personnel reductions and facilities closures 
the restructuring programs will have no impact on our drug discovery and development programs as we intend to continue to invest in research and development related to these efforts 
we expect these research and development expenses to continue to increase in  and such expenses should partially offset our expected expense reductions from the restructuring program 
we expect our total research and development expenses to range from to million in research and development expenses in millions salary and benefits related collaboration and outside services occupancy and all other costs total research and development expenses we currently track research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project 
these costs are exclusive of all charges related to the purchase of in process research and development projects 
the decrease in from was primarily the result of expenses eliminated from the restructuring programs  partially offset by increased drug discovery and development expenses 
the decrease in from was primarily the result of expenses eliminated in the exit of the custom genomics product lines  partially offset by increased drug discovery and development expenses and certain write offs related to impaired research and development assets 
we expect that research and development expenditures related to drug discovery and development will increase during and subsequent years due to the continuation and expansion of clinical trials for our small molecule programs  the initiation of trials for other potential indications and additional study expenditures for potential pharmaceutical candidates 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
our most advanced clinical development programs are our efforts for reverset to treat hiv and antagonists to the ccr receptor 
currently  we intend to initiate a phase ii human clinical trial for reverset in the first half of our ccr antagonist program is currently completing pre clinical development  and we expect to commence a phase i clinical trial for this program in the first half of as well 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials  including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our trials 
in addition  the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses in millions salary and benefits related outside legal services related to patent infringement litigation other contract services and outside costs total selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in over was primarily the result of expenses eliminated from the restructuring programs and decreased legal expenses  partially offset by additional administrative headcount and related costs incurred to support the growth of our drug discovery and development efforts 
regardless of the outcome  we expect our ongoing patent infringement litigation and pending arbitration to result in future costs to us  which could be substantial 
the decrease in over resulted primarily from the exit of the custom genomics product lines  infrastructure reductions and decreased legal expenses  partially offset by additional administrative headcount and related costs incurred to support the growth of our drug discovery and development efforts 
loss on sale of assets 
loss on sales of assets for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the loss is due to routine disposition of assets in the normal course of business 
the loss in resulted from the divestiture of the transgenics product line and the sale of certain of those assets 
purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expenses for the year ended december  of million consisted of million for the acquisition of maxia and million related to a collaborative license agreement with pharmasset 
other expenses 
other expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  and represent charges recorded in connection with restructuring and long lived asset impairments 
in  these expenses consisted of million in workforce reduction  million in equipment and other asset write offs  million in impairment of capitalized software  million related to an increase in the restructuring accrual and million related to an increase in the restructuring accrual 
in  these expenses consisted of million in workforce reduction  million in equipment and other asset write offs  million in lease commitments and other accruals related to the restructuring announced in the fourth quarter of  and million related to the increase in the restructuring charges 
in  these expenses  of which million were non cash charges  were comprised of the following items related to the restructuring in the fourth quarter of million goodwill and intangibles impairment and million nonrecurring restructuring charges and million impairment of long lived asset 
other income expense interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december    and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to million of long term investment impairment charges  a decrease in cash invested and lower interest rates in  partially offset by a million long term investment gain in and interest and premium earned on the conversion of a note held in another company in the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in cash invested and lower interest rates in  and long term investment impairment charges deemed to be other than temporary  totaling million in  which were lower than impairment charges

gain loss on certain derivative financial instruments 
gain on certain derivative financial instruments for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  and loss on certain derivative financial instruments for the year ended december  of million represents the change in fair value of certain long term investments  specifically warrants held in other companies  in accordance with fasb statement no accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities sfas 
gain or loss on derivative financial instruments may fluctuate in any given period based upon current market conditions and is recognized during the period of change

the increase in net loss in was primarily due to a decrease in revenues and interest and other income expense  net 
the net change in cash used in as compared to was also due to a decrease in cash provided from accounts receivable related to a decrease in sales and an increase in collection efforts  and higher cash usage for accrued and other current liabilities due to the timing of payments made 
our negative cash flows from operating activities in was primarily the result of a decrease in revenues due to the softening of the genomic information products market and the related decrease in cash provided by the sale of our information products  including licensing of intellectual property 
the change in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to the increase in net loss in  adjusted for non cash items such as restructuring charges and impairment of long lived assets  as well as the decrease in accrued and other liabilities and deferred revenue  offset by higher cash provided by the decrease in accounts receivable in as compared to our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long term investments

capital expenditures decreased in due to reduced operational needs given our exit of custom genomics product lines  partially offset by increased spending in support of our drug discovery and development efforts 
purchases of long term investments were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  we expended million related to the acquisition of maxia 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  acquisitions  including possible earn out payments to former maxia stockholders  capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net cash provided by financing activities was million year ended december  we repurchased million face value of our convertible subordinated notes on the open market for million in  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million 
in october  we announced that our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
through december   we had purchased and retired  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock and to repurchase convertible subordinated notes  offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions total less than year years years over years contractual obligations principal on convertible subordinated debt interest on convertible subordinated debt non cancelable operating lease obligations related to current operations related to vacated space total contractual obligations the amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations 
amounts related to vacated space is net of contractual sub lease rental payments 
estimates may require further adjustments due to changes in real estate market conditions  such as higher than expected vacancy rates or lower sublease rates 
the table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events 
the most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations are summarized below 
we have a purchase commitment of million as of december   the timing of which is dependent upon provision by the vendor of products or services 
additionally  as of december   we have committed to purchase up to million of equity in genomic health  inc genomic health  at the election of genomic health  which election may be made by genomic health at any time on or after january  additional commitments related to maxia and pharmasset are also considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable 
in february  we completed our acquisition of maxia 
under the merger agreement  former maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of million in cash and million in our common stock based upon the then fair value could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones 
the milestones are set to occur as maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
in any event  no more than  shares of our common stock may be issued to former maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement 
none of these milestones has been achieved as of december  under the terms of our collaborative licensing agreement with pharmasset  we agreed to pay pharmasset certain future performance milestone payments and future royalties on net sales  none of these milestones has been achieved as of december  we have entered into and intend to continue to seek to license additional patent rights relating to compounds or technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs 
under these licenses  we may be required to pay milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products 
in december  we entered into an agreement with a clinical research organization  or cro  to provide certain reverset clinical trial management services 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to pay this cro up to million for certain future performance milestone payments  management fees and pre approved out of pocket expenses 
as of december   no payments related to this agreement had been made  nor have any of these milestones been achieved 
we expect to use net cash in as we invest in our drug discovery and development programs  continue to invest in our intellectual property portfolio  make payments related to our restructuring programs  continue to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development and new alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions  and make strategic investments 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with the net proceeds from the february private placement of convertible subordinated notes described below under recent developments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to attract and retain customers for our bkl database and to license our intellectual property  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  expenditures in connection with potential repayments of our subordinated convertible notes due in  expenditures in connection with our expansion of drug discovery and development programs  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  capital expenditures required to expand our facilities  including facilities for our expanding therapeutic discovery and development programs  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we expect that future revenues generated from information products  including licensing of intellectual property  will continue to decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs  and in  will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed under contractual obligations 
recent developments in february  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
in march  we issued an additional million of these convertible notes to the initial purchasers of the notes which resulted in additional net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per year  payable semi annually on february and august  and are due february  the notes are subordinated to all senior indebtedness and pari passu in right of payment with our convertible subordinated notes due as of december   we had no senior indebtedness 
the notes are convertible into shares of our stock at an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
we may redeem the notes beginning february  factors that may affect results risks relating to our business we are at the early stage of our drug discovery and development efforts and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts 
we are in the early stage of building our drug discovery and development operations 
our ability to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on proteins  antibodies and other compounds will depend on our ability to hire and retain key scientific employees  identify high quality therapeutic targets  identify potential drug candidates  develop products internally or license drug candidates from others  identify and enroll suitable volunteers  either in the united states or abroad  for our clinical trials  complete laboratory testing and clinical testing on humans  obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products  both in the united states and abroad  enter into arrangements with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our behalf  or develop efficient production facilities meeting all regulatory requirements  deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions  lease facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth  and enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products 
of the compounds that we identify as potential drug products or that we in license from other companies  only a few  at most  are statistically likely to lead to successful drug development programs 
significant research and development efforts will be necessary 
we have limited experience with these activities and may not be successful in developing or commercializing drug products 
if we choose to outsource some of these activities  we may be unable to enter into outsourcing or licensing agreements on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  if we elect to manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities  we will require substantial additional capital resources to lease or build and maintain those facilities  including attracting and retaining qualified personnel to lease or build and operate our facilities 
our efforts to discover and develop potential drug candidates may not lead to the development  commercialization or marketing of drug products 
we are currently engaged in a number of different approaches to discover and develop novel drug candidates 
we are internally developing novel small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists to treat inflammation and our scientists have produced a number of lead compounds that are in the final stages of preclinical testing 
our other internal drug discovery programs are focused on protease inhibitors to treat cancer and protein phosphatases to treat cancer and metabolic diseases 
discovery and development of potential drug candidates are expensive and time consuming  and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates that can be successfully developed and marketed 
if our efforts do not lead to the discovery of a drug candidate  we may be unable to grow our clinical pipeline or we may be unable to enter into agreements with collaborators who are willing to develop our drug candidates 
the success of our drug discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities 
if we are unable to establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts may be unsuccessful  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
an important element of our business strategy will be to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with third parties under which we license our drugs candidates to those third parties for development and commercialization 
we expect that while we may initially seek to conduct initial clinical testing on our drug candidates  we will need to seek collaborators for a number of our drug candidates because of the expense  effort and expertise required to continue additional clinical testing and further develop those drug candidates 
because collaboration arrangements are complex to negotiate  we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements 
also  we may not have drug compounds that are desirable to other parties  or we may be unwilling to license a drug compound because the party interested in it is a competitor 
the terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us 
alternatively  potential collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of our financial  regulatory or intellectual property position 
if we are not able to establish collaborative agreements  we may not be able to develop and commercialize a drug product  which would adversely affect our business and our revenues 
in order for any of these collaboration efforts to be successful  we must first identify potential collaborators whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours 
we may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources  but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and for licenses to technology rights 
however  it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators devote to our programs or potential products 
if our collaborators prove difficult to work with  are less skilled than we originally expected or do not devote adequate resources to the program  the relationship will not be successful 
if a business combination involving a collaborator and a third party were to occur  the effect could be to diminish  terminate or cause delays in development of a potential product 
we face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts  and if we do not compete effectively  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our drug discovery and development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are being developed by our competitors  many of which have substantially greater resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  more experience in completing preclinical and clinical trials in order to obtain regulatory approvals and marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
as a result of these resources  our competitors may develop drug products that render our products obsolete and noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs or by developing their products more efficiently 
our ability to develop competitive products would be limited if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we were able to or in obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug development efforts 
any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with collaborators  might not be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing and future products  or obtain regulatory approval in the united states or elsewhere 
our ability to develop and commercialize reverset may be adversely affected if a dispute arose with pharmasset 
we are developing reverset under a collaborative licensing agreement with pharmasset entered into in september if a dispute arose with pharmasset over the terms of the collaborative license agreement  including the alleged breach of any provision  our development  commercialization and marketing of reverset may be adversely affected 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators or advisors and us  our collaborators or advisors may act in their self interest  which may adversely affect our business 
if conflicts arise between us and our collaborators  including pharmasset  or our scientific advisors  the other party may act in its self interest and not in the interest of our stockholders 
conflicts may arise with our collaborators if they pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments for the diseases that we have targeted 
competing products  either developed by these future collaborators or to which these future collaborators have rights  may result in their withdrawal of support for our product candidates 
additionally  conflicts may arise if there is a dispute about the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship 
similarly  the parties to a collaboration agreement may disagree as to which party owns newly developed products 
should an agreement be terminated as a result of a dispute and before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration  our reputation could be harmed and we may not obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving 
if we fail to enter into additional in licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful  our business and operations might be adversely affected 
in addition to establishing collaborative arrangements under which third parties license our drug candidates for development and commercialization  we intend to continue to explore opportunities to develop our clinical pipeline by in licensing drug compounds that fit within our expertise and research and development capabilities 
we may be unable to enter into any additional in licensing agreements because suitable product candidates that are within our expertise may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or because competitors with greater resources seek to in license the same product candidates 
product candidates that we would like to develop may not be available to us because they are controlled by competitors who are unwilling to license the rights to the drug compound or candidate to us 
we may also need to license drug delivery or other technology in order to continue to develop our drug candidate pipeline 
if we are unable to enter into additional agreements to license drug candidates  drug delivery technology or other technology or if these arrangements are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be adversely affected 
we have limited expertise with and capacity to conduct clinical trials  and our resulting dependence on third parties to conduct clinical trials could result in delays in and additional costs for our drug development efforts 
we have only limited experience with clinical trials  manufacturing and commercialization of drug products 
we also have limited internal resources and capacity to perform preclinical studies and clinical trials 
as a result  we intend to hire contract research organizations  or cros  to perform most of our clinical trials for drug candidates that we choose to develop without a collaborator 
if the cros that we hire to perform our clinical trials or our collaborators do not meet deadlines or do not follow proper procedures  our clinical trials may take longer than expected  may be delayed or may be terminated 
if we were forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of our clinical trials  we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms  or at all 
even if we were able to find another company to perform a trial  the delay in the trial may result in significant expenditures 
events such as these may result in delays in our obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates or our ability to commercialize our products and could result in increased expenditures that would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  for some of our drug candidates  we plan to contract with collaborators to advance those candidates through later stage  more expensive clinical trials  rather than invest our own resources to perform these trials 
depending on the terms of our agreements with these collaborators  we may not have any control over the conduct of these clinical trials  and in any event we would be subject to the risks associated with depending on collaborators to develop these drug candidates 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we will not be permitted to manufacture or commercialize products resulting from our research 
in order to manufacture and commercialize drug products in the united states  our drug candidates will have to obtain regulatory approval from the food and drug administration  or the fda 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years 
to obtain regulatory approval  we must first show that our drug products are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical studies animal testing and clinical trials human testing 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes  and we do not know whether the fda will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any potential drug products in addition to reverset 
completion of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing 
the length of time required varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
interim results of a preclinical study or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
for example  a drug candidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects when tested at the clinical level 
our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  variability in the number and types of patients available for each study  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  unforeseen safety issues or side effects  poor or unanticipated effectiveness of products during the clinical trials  or government or regulatory delays 
data obtained from the clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
in addition  regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of other factors  such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
due  in part  to the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process  we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we develop 
at the present time  we have one drug candidate  reverset  in phase ii clinical trials and our other drug candidates are still undergoing preclinical testing 
compounds developed by us  alone or with other parties  may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective 
failure to obtain regulatory approval would delay or prevent us from commercializing products 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above and may also include additional risks 
our reliance on third parties to manufacture and commercialize any of our drug candidates that receives regulatory approval could result in a short supply of the drugs or withdrawal of the fda s regulatory approval 
the fda requires that drug products be manufactured according to its current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations and a limited number of manufacturers comply with these requirements 
if the third party that we choose to manufacture our drug products is not compliant with cgmp  the fda may not approve our application to manufacture our drug products 
we may not be able to arrange for our products to be manufactured by one of these companies on reasonable terms  if at all 
failure to comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our products could result in the fda withdrawing its regulatory approval of our drug product or other enforcement actions 
if either of these events occurred  our revenues would be negatively impacted 
if we receive marketing approval from the fda for any of our drug candidates  we will rely on a third party to manufacture our products 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our new drug products if the manufacturer does not have the capacity to manufacture our products according to our schedule 
also  raw materials that may be required to manufacture any products we develop may only be available from a limited number of suppliers 
if we have promised delivery of a new product and are unable to meet the delivery requirement due to manufacturing difficulties  our reputation would be impaired or our customers may buy our competitors products 
additionally  we may have to expend additional sums in order to ensure that manufacturing capacity is available when we need it even if we do not use all of the manufacturing capacity 
this expense would adversely affect our operating results 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production  especially in scaling up initial production 
these problems include difficulties with production costs and yields  quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel  as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal  state and foreign regulations 
the third party manufacturer we choose may not perform as agreed or may terminate its agreement with us 
we may incur additional expense in order to market our drug products 
we do not have experience marketing drug products to customers 
if the fda approves one of our drug products to go to market  we would have to employ additional personnel or engage a third party to market our drug products  which would be an additional expense to us 
we might not be able to commercialize our drug candidates successfully  and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so 
reverset is our only drug candidate in clinical testing 
we  or our collaborators  may decide to discontinue development of any or all of our drug candidates at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
if a product is developed  but is not marketed  we may have spent significant amounts of time and money on it  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
even if reverset  or another drug candidate that we develop  receives regulatory approval  we may decide not to commercialize it if we determine that commercialization of that product would require more money and time than we are willing to invest 
for example  drugs that receive approval are subject to post regulatory surveillance and may have to be withdrawn from the market if previously unknown side effects occur 
at this point  the regulatory agencies may require additional clinical studies 
once a drug is marketed  if it causes side effects  the drug product may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation  additional studies  changes in labeling  warnings to the public and negative publicity 
as a result  we may not continue to commercialize a product even though it has obtained regulatory approval 
further  we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if the market does not accept the product because it is too expensive and third parties such as insurance companies or medicare have not approved it for substantial reimbursement 
actions of governmental authorities and other groups could result in lower prices for certain drugs  including drugs that address hiv infection 
in addition  we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if another product comes on the market that is as effective but has fewer side effects 
there is also a risk that competitors and third parties may develop similar or superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products 
our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from third party payors 
the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability  and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
while we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could reduce the price that we or any of our collaborators receive for any products in the future 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained by governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
as our drug discovery and development operations are conducted at our headquarters in wilmington  delaware  the loss of access to this facility would negatively impact our business 
our facility in wilmington  delaware is our headquarters and is also where we conduct all of our drug discovery operations and research and development activities 
our lease contains provisions that provide for its early termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default or upon a change of control 
further  our headquarters facility is located in a large research and development complex that may be temporarily or permanently shutdown if certain environmental or other hazardous conditions were to occur within the complex 
in addition  actions of activists opposed to aspects of pharmaceutical research may disrupt our experiments or our ability to access or use our facilities 
the loss of access to or use of our wilmington  delaware  facility  either on a temporary or permanent basis  or early termination of our lease would result in an interruption of our business and  consequently  would adversely affect the advancement of our drug discovery and development programs and our overall business 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to expand our drug discovery and development programs and achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit  train and retain essential scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development programs  including those who will be responsible for our internal preclinical and clinical testing as well as for the establishment of collaborations with other companies 
if we lose the services of any of these people  our research and product development goals  including the identification and establishment of key collaborations  operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed 
we do not maintain key person insurance on any of our employees 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating companies we acquire  which may harm our operations and financial results 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and may in the future acquire assets  technologies  compounds and businesses 
our past acquisitions  such as the acquisition of maxia pharmaceuticals  inc  have involved  and our future acquisitions may involve risks such as the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  our acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  we may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  disrupting our business and diverting our management s time and attention  we may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology  compounds or drug candidates  we may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  our relationships with key customers of acquired businesses may be impaired  due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  we may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses  we may incur amortization or impairment expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets  or our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses that are not located near our new headquarters  we may experience more difficulty integrating and managing the acquired businesses operations 
we may encounter difficulties  including higher than anticipated costs and the diversion of management s attention  as a result of the restructuring of our business and the relocation of our headquarters and finance department from california to delaware 
in february  we announced a significant reduction in our workforce and the closure of our palo alto  california research facilities 
we may incur higher than anticipated costs or delays in closing our california facilities  and this restructuring could result in the diversion of the efforts of our executive management team and other key employees  which could adversely affect our drug discovery and development efforts 
as a part of this restructuring  we are discontinuing our information products research and development efforts  with the exception of the activities related to  and products developed by  our proteome subsidiary 
we may encounter difficulties associated with the discontinuation of certain of our information product related activities that could adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
these difficulties could include challenges in providing support to our customers  and  in particular  our non us customers 
some of our database customers could become dissatisfied as a result of our restructuring  and we could incur expenses associated with the amendment  termination or transition of these customer contracts 
as a part of increasing our focus on our drug discovery and development programs  we are relocating our headquarters  including our finance and legal staff and systems  to our facility in wilmington  delaware 
our operating and financial results could be adversely affected by the risks associated with this relocation  including unanticipated delays  ineffective transition of responsibilities or systems  the retention of certain key employees  the hiring of finance personnel in delaware  and ineffective transition of responsibilities for our intellectual property portfolio 
during this transition process  we expect that we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and our relationships with information products customers  suppliers and other third parties 
if we are unable to effectively transition our remaining information product line activities  our internal information management activities  our financial reporting  or our management of our intellectual property portfolio to the employees or outside parties who will take over those responsibilities  we may incur higher costs associated with the transition 
risks relating to our financial results we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we had net losses from inception in through and in through because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we will continue to spend significant amounts on our efforts to discover and develop drugs 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur losses in and in future periods as well 
we expect that any revenues from our information products  intellectual property licensing  and contracts  if any  will be more than offset by expenses for our drug discovery and development efforts 
we anticipate that these efforts will increase as we focus on the studies  including preclinical studies and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval  that are required before we can sell  or license to a third party  a drug product 
the development of drug products will require us to spend significant funds on research  development  testing  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
to date  we do not have any drug products that have generated revenues and we anticipate that we will not generate significant revenues from the drug candidates that we license or develop for several years  if ever 
we cannot be certain whether or when we will achieve profitability because of the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially successful drug products 
even if we were successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for manufacturing and commercializing reverset  our leading drug candidate  or another drug  we expect that we will continue to incur losses if our drug products do not generate significant revenues 
if we achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
we will need additional capital in the future 
the capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it  which could result in limitations on our research and development or commercialization efforts or the loss of certain of our rights in our technologies or drug candidates 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
additional factors that may affect our future funding requirements include any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  the results of research and development  preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by us or our future collaborative partners or licensees  if any  the acquisition or licensing of businesses  technologies or compounds  if any  our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations  competing technological and market developments  the amount of revenues generated from our business activities  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  the receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees from our current or future collaborative and license arrangements  if established  and the timing of regulatory approvals 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in companies such as ours  or in the marketplace generally  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may have to scale back our operations  eliminate one or more of our development programs  or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborative partner that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates 
if we are unable to raise funds at the time that we desire or at any time thereafter on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue to develop our potential drug products 
the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future would be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness 
because our revenues are derived from information products and licensing activities  our revenues may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect that our revenues from our information products in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as to the academic community 
accordingly  these revenues will depend in large part upon the success of the companies within these industries and their demand for our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries or by the academic community 
these reductions and delays may result from factors such as changes in economic conditions  consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  changes in the regulatory environment  including governmental pricing controls  affecting health care and health care providers  pricing pressures  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and other factors affecting research and development spending 
these factors are not within our control and may cause volatility to the price of our common stock 
future milestone and royalty payments from our gene related intellectual property may not contribute significantly to revenues for several years  and may never result in revenues 
part of our strategy is to license to our database customers and to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our know how and patent rights associated with the information we have generated in the creation of our proprietary databases  for use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical  diagnostic or other products 
any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require several years of further development  clinical testing and regulatory approval before commercialization  all of which is beyond our control  and possibly beyond the control of our licensee 
these licensees may not develop the potential product if they do not devote the necessary resources or decide that they do not want to expend the resources to do the clinical testing necessary to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
therefore  milestone or royalty payments from these licenses may not contribute to our revenues for several years  if at all 
our long term investments may decline in value and our losses may increase 
we have made and may in the future make long term investments in entities that complement our business 
these investments may often be made in securities lacking a public trading market or subject to trading restrictions  either of which increases our risk and reduces the liquidity of our investment  require us to record losses and expenses related to our ownership interest  require us to record acquisition related charges  such as in process research and development  require us to record charges related to the impairment in the value of the securities underlying our investment  and require us to invest greater amounts than anticipated or to devote substantial management time to the management of research and development relationships or other relationships 
the market values of many of these investments can fluctuate significantly 
we evaluate our long term investments for impairment of their value on a quarterly basis 
the volatility of the equity markets and the uncertainty of the biotechnology industry may result in fluctuations in the value of our investments in public companies 
the value of our investments in private companies can fluctuate significantly 
in past periods  market conditions have caused us to write down the value of our private company investments  sometimes substantially  and market conditions may cause us to write down additional amounts 
in addition  we have in the past written down the value of our debt investments in companies experiencing financial difficulties 
impairment could result in future charges to our earnings 
decreases in the value of our strategic investments may cause our losses to increase 
as of december   the total aggregate value of our long term investments was million 
we incurred charges related to write downs in the valuation of long term investments of million in the fourth quarter of and million for the year ended december  we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of december   we had total consolidated debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
in february and march  we issued million and million  respectively  of additional debt 
the indentures pursuant to which our outstanding convertible subordinated notes were issued do not limit the issuance of additional indebtedness 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital and research and development expenditures  and general corporate purposes  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
in the past five years  we have had negative cash flow from operations 
we likely will not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements with respect to our outstanding 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due were outstanding 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in march  we issued an additional million of our convertible subordinated notes due to the initial purchasers of those notes 
our annual interest payments for the notes through  assuming none of these notes are converted  redeemed  repurchased or exchanged  are million  and an additional million in interest is payable in our annual interest payments for the notes through  assuming none of these notes are converted  redeemed  repurchased or exchanged  are million  and an additional million in interest will be payable in we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from our existing cash and marketable securities 
if we are unable to generate cash from our operations or raise additional cash through financings sufficient to meet these obligations  we will need to use existing cash or liquidate marketable securities in order to fund these obligations  which may delay or curtail our research  development and commercialization programs 
risks relating to intellectual property and legal matters we are involved in patent litigation  which  if not resolved favorably  could require us to pay damages 
in october  invitrogen corporation filed an action against us in federal court  alleging infringement of three patents 
the complaint seeks unspecified money damages and injunctive relief 
in november  we filed our answer to invitrogen s patent infringement claims  and asserted seven counterclaims against invitrogen  seeking declaratory relief with respect to the patents at issue  implied license  estoppel  laches and patent misuse 
we are also seeking our fees  costs and expenses 
invitrogen filed its answer to our counterclaims in january in february  we added a counterclaim for unfair business practices 
on february   the court ordered a stay of all proceedings pending disposition of the appeal in a related case of a judgment invalidating the same patents that are asserted in this case 
our defenses against the suit brought by invitrogen may be unsuccessful 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss or damages resulting from this suit due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome 
if the case goes forward  we expect that the invitrogen litigation will result in future legal and other costs to us  regardless of the outcome  which could be substantial 
in november  we filed a complaint against invitrogen in federal court alleging infringement of some of our patents 
our complaint sought a permanent injunction enjoining invitrogen from further infringement of the patents at issue  damages for invitrogen s conduct  as well as our fees  costs and interest 
we further sought triple damages from the infringement claim based on invitrogen s willful infringement of our patents 
in january  we reached an agreement to settle our suit against invitrogen  with invitrogen entering into a license agreement with us 
on february   the court ordered dismissal of the case 
we are involved in contractual arbitration  which could be costly to us 
we are in an arbitration with iconix pharmaceuticals  inc with respect to payments that iconix alleges we owe it pursuant to a contract 
iconix initiated the arbitration process under the contract seeking final and binding arbitration 
based upon our pre arbitration correspondence with iconix  we believe iconix is alleging that we have repudiated our obligation to make future payments in the aggregate amount of million through the remainder of the contract term ending in there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the arbitration and  at this time  we cannot predict the financial impact to us of the results of the arbitration 
regardless of the outcome  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management time as a result of the arbitration 
if we are subject to additional litigation and infringement claims  they could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and development efforts 
the technology that we use to develop our drug products  and the technology that we incorporate in our products  may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
the success of our drug discovery and development efforts will also depend on our ability to develop new compounds  drugs and technologies without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
from time to time we may receive notices from third parties alleging patent or copyright infringement  claims regarding trade secrets or other contract claims 
receipt of these letters could result in significant costs as a result of the diversion of the attention of management from our drug discovery and development efforts 
except for invitrogen and iconix  no third party has a current filed patent lawsuit or arbitration against us 
if a successful claim were brought against us  we would have to attempt to license the technology from the claimant or to spend time and money to design around the technology 
any such license of the technology may not be available at reasonable terms  or at all 
we may  however  be involved in future lawsuits alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can be very costly and can divert management s efforts 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our collaborators to seek licenses to other parties patents or proprietary rights 
we or our collaborators may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling a drug product that we develop 
further  we or our future collaborators may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information  which may result in its unauthorized use  a loss of revenue under a collaboration agreement or loss of sales to generic versions of our products or otherwise reduce our ability to compete 
our business and competitive position depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology  including any drug products that we create 
despite our efforts to protect this information  unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
for example  one of our collaborators may disclose proprietary information pertaining to our drug discovery efforts 
any patents issued in connection with our drug discovery efforts may not be broad enough to protect all of the potential uses of the product 
additionally  when we do not control the prosecution  maintenance and enforcement of certain important intellectual property  such as a drug compound in licensed to us  the protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our hands 
in the case of reverset  we do not control the intellectual property rights with respect to the compound and therefore may be unable to protect those rights 
if the entity that controls the intellectual property rights related to reverset does not adequately protect those rights  our rights may be impaired  which may impact our ability to develop  market and commercialize reverset 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  otherwise gain access to our proprietary information  or design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
we pursue a policy of having our employees  consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
if we fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection  our potential  future revenues may be decreased 
if the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the united states patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications  the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased 
the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
a shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents 
the united states patent laws were amended in to change the term of patent protection from years from patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the average time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications is at least one year and may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection 
also  we may need to refile some of our applications claiming large numbers of genes and  in these situations  the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority application 
this would shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might obtain from the patents 
if patent application filing fees are significantly increased  our expenses related to intellectual property or our intellectual property strategy may be adversely affected 
our ability to license proprietary genes may be dependent on our ability to obtain patents 
we have a large portfolio of issued united states patents covering human full length genes  the proteins they encode and the antibodies directed against them and a significant number of pending applications 
if legislation currently proposed by the united states patent and trademark office is adopted  fees associated with filing and prosecuting patent applications would increase significantly 
if such fees are significantly increased  we would incur higher expenses and our intellectual property strategy could be adversely affected 
international patent protection is particularly uncertain  and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries  we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources 
biotechnology patent law outside the united states is even more uncertain than in the united states and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
further  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states laws 
for example  certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors foreign patents  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products and our results of operations could be harmed 
the clinical testing and marketing of medical products that are intended for human use entails an inherent risk of product liability 
if any product that we or any of our collaborators develops causes injury or is found to be unsuitable during clinical trials  manufacturing or sale  we may be held liable 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities  including substantial damages to be paid to the victims and legal costs  or we may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
although we currently carry a product liability insurance policy that provides coverage for liabilities arising from our clinical trials  it may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
in addition  we believe we should increase our coverage upon the addition of new clinical trials  and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our collaborators and may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop  alone or with our collaborators 
additionally  any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation  recall of products  participants to withdraw from clinical trials  and potential collaborators to seek other partners  any of which could impact our results of operations 
because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials  we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials that could be time consuming and costly 
we are subject to various environmental  health and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  the use  handling  storage and disposal of regulated substances and the health and safety of our employees 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste resulting in the production of hazardous waste products 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
if any injury or contamination results from our use or by the use by third party collaborators of these materials  we may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
further  we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations 
compliance with the applicable environmental and workplace laws and regulations is expensive 
future changes to environmental  health  workplace and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or may restrict our operations or impair our research  development and production efforts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our investments in short term marketable securities 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk  investment grade instruments 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in fair value would not be material 
we are exposed to valuation risks related to our portfolio of long term investments 
these investments are primarily in small capitalization stocks of privately held companies in the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry sector and are primarily in companies with which we have research and development  licensing or other collaborative agreements 
as of december   long term investments were million 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign currency exchange risk on transactions denominated in foreign currencies or for speculative or trading purposes 
if currency exchange rates were to fluctuate immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the impact to our financial position or results of operations would not be material
