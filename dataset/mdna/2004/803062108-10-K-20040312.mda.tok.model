item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sapient is a leading business consulting and technology services firm that plans  designs  implements and manages information technology to improve business performance for global clients 
sapient was founded in based on a single promise to deliver the right business results on time and on budget 
our fixed price fixed time model  combined with our industry  design  technology and process expertise  provides clients with the highest business value at the lowest total cost of ownership 
we have offices across the united states and in canada  the united kingdom  germany and india 
the market for technology consulting services declined significantly in and  but began to stabilize and modestly improve in the second half of we have seen stabilization and some modest growth in our service revenues  beginning in the third quarter of our service revenues were million for  a increase from service revenues of million for  but a decrease from service revenues of million for overall  of the increase in our revenues from to was attributable to changes in currency rates 
as a result of restructuring and other cost cutting actions beginning in  our loss from continuing operations decreased from million in to million in our loss from continuing operations for included a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
our cash used in operations for was million  including million used for previously recorded restructuring actions  compared to million for  including million used for previously recorded restructuring actions 
we have accrued restructuring costs  primarily related to vacated facilities recorded in prior years  of million at december  our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments at december  were million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirement and expected cash outlay for our previously recorded restructuring activities for at least the next months 
however  if the recent stabilization and improvement in the demand for our services does not continue and we suffer declines in our service revenues  we may incur additional losses and negative cash flows  and these could be significant 
we have begun to see growth in the demand for our services and an improvement in our pipeline of potential business  beginning in the third quarter of our service revenues for the fourth quarter of 
table of contents increased from the third quarter of  following a increase from the second quarter of our annualized service revenues per billable employee were  for the fourth quarter of  compared to  for the third quarter of and  for each of the first and second quarters of our utilization rate for the fourth quarter was  compared to  and for the first  second and third quarters of  respectively 
we are focused on increasing recurring revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
recurring revenues include application management services  which grew in from  and represented of our total service revenues in we expect that application management services will continue to grow  but at a lower rate on a long term basis 
on january   in a conference call announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter of  we estimated that our service revenues for the first quarter of would be in the range of to million  based on our then current revenue projections 
as a result of the growth in the demand for our services  we expect to increase the number of our project personnel in order to maintain effective staffing levels  particularly in the united kingdom and india 
in addition  we are working to reduce our turnover level of  which will further our efforts to achieve the desired staffing mix 
currently  we are retaining subcontractors in certain cases to fill specific project needs  but we expect this practice to decline over time as we hire and train new project personnel 
if we are not successful in maintaining effective staffing levels  our ability to achieve our service revenue and profitability objectives will be adversely affected 
the total of our project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs declined from as a result of our restructuring and other cost cutting actions taken in and the first half of these costs declined from million for the first quarter of to million and million for the second and third quarters of  respectively 
however  as a result of the growth in the demand for our services in the fourth quarter of  our project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs increased to million for the fourth quarter of  primarily due to the increased project personnel costs required to meet the increased demand in our services 
we expect that our project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs will continue to increase in the first quarter of  as we expand to meet the anticipated increased demand for our services 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we reported net income of million and million  respectively 
on january   in a conference call announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter of  we estimated a operating margin on our expected service revenues for the first quarter of  based on our then current revenue and cost projections 
although we are seeing signs of growth in our business  the economic outlook is still uncertain 
we believe that technology spending by large companies improved in the second half of  however  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  the improvement in the market for technology consulting services will continue 
when the market does improve significantly  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  the demand for our services will increase 
any decline in our service revenues will have a significant impact on our financial results  particularly because a significant portion of our operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
as a result  despite cost savings realized from our restructuring plans  our costs for project personnel  sales and marketing and general and administrative could increase as a percentage of revenues  thereby affecting our operating results 
our global distributed delivery sm gdd methodology continues to increase in importance 
we created this proprietary methodology in  which allows us to provide high quality solutions using accelerated work schedules  by utilizing india s highly skilled technology specialists  lower costs and the time differences between india and the countries we serve 
we also employ our gdd methodology to provide application management services 
the billable days  or level of effort  incurred by our india people as a percentage of total company billable days increased from for the first quarter of to for the fourth quarter of our utilization rate for our india people was for the fourth quarter of  as compared to  and for the first  second and third quarters of  respectively 
projects with a 
table of contents gdd component accounted for of our total service revenues in  compared to for and for our future segment and overall company revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenues from a large project or client may constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in a particular quarter 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services under written service contracts with our clients 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
revenue generated from fixed price contracts  with the exception of support and maintenance contracts  is recognized based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue generated from fixed price support and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contract term 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized as services are provided 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor hours incurred and estimated total labor hours  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for a contract 
certain contracts provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue is recognized when such performance standards are achieved  including  of revenue recognized in revenue from multiple element arrangements is accounted for under eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for these arrangements  we evaluate all deliverables in the contract to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables represent separate units of accounting  we then measure and allocate the consideration from the arrangement to the separate units  based on reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
this evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered  and involves significant judgments regarding the nature of the services and deliverables being provided and whether these services and deliverables can reasonably be divided into the separate units of accounting 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a preferred partnership with a client for a three year period 
we performed a detailed assessment of the contract terms and deliverables and determined that the multiple deliverables could not be separated into 
table of contents individual units of accounting 
we concluded that revenue should be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for a contract or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue for services where collection from the client is probable  and our fees are fixed or determinable 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all available evidence  such as recent and expected future operating results by tax jurisdiction  current and enacted tax legislation and other temporary differences between book and tax accounting  to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of net operating losses incurred in most jurisdictions in which we operate in the past three fiscal years  and uncertainty as to the extent  jurisdiction and timing of profitability in future periods  we have continued to record a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which was approximately million as of december  the establishment and amount of the valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
valuation of long lived assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or 
table of contents circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and valuation of long lived assets requires significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue and expense growth projections and fair value estimates such as estimated replacement cost and relief from royalty 
these estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if different estimates or adjustments were used  it is reasonably possible that our analysis would have generated materially different results 
as of december  and  we have no remaining goodwill balances 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning january   we ceased amortization of goodwill  which was approximately million at that time 
we performed an impairment review of our goodwill as of january   under the transitional provisions of sfas during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill and concluded that no impairment of the goodwill had occurred as of january  by june   our stock price had declined significantly from january   at which point our market capitalization  based on our stock price  was below our book value  and we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed 
our stock price at january  was per share and declined to per share at june  based on the analysis at june   the carrying amount of all reporting units exceeded their fair values and a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing of the goodwill balance  was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the impairment analysis requires significant estimates and assumptions  including the allocation of assets and liabilities to reporting units and fair value estimates of reporting units based on a market multiple of revenue approach 
these estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if different estimates or adjustments were used  it is reasonably possible that our analysis would have generated materially different results 
restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out assumptions  sub lease assumptions and space requirements may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if any future 
table of contents adjustments are required to the restructuring initiatives recorded under the provisions of eitf  such adjustments will be measured in accordance with eitf sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
sfas includes a rebuttable presumption that if an entity has a past practice of providing similar termination benefits to employees  the benefit arrangement is presumed to be an ongoing benefit arrangement that should be accounted for under sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
sfas prescribes the accounting for the estimated cost of benefits  including severance benefits  provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement 
a liability is recognized when the severance amounts relate to prior services rendered  the payment of the amount is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
since the second quarter of  we have accounted for severance related restructuring charges in accordance with sfas because we have a history of paying similar severance benefits since we have not recorded any liability related to other post employment benefits  as of december   since the amounts are neither probable nor reasonably estimable 
our remaining cash lease commitments related to restructured facilities are approximately million at december   of which is accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  and the remaining relates to sub lease assumptions 
we have entered into signed sub lease arrangements for approximately million  with the remaining million for future estimated sub lease arrangements 
if the estimated sub lease dates were to be extended by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional million in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
contingent liabilities 
we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts we have previously accrued 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements  other than the ownership interest that we held in our joint venture in milan  italy until july   at which time our interest in the joint venture was acquired by the management team of the joint venture 
see equity investments in this part ii  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a more detailed discussion of this joint venture 
we do not have any other arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
effect of certain transactions investment in consolidated subsidiary on january   we increased our ownership percentage in hwt  inc hwt  formerly healthwatch technologies  llc  a consolidated subsidiary by purchasing a total of  shares of hwt common stock from jerry a

these assets will be amortized on a straight line basis over lives of years 
on march   hwt issued  shares of its common stock to an executive officer of hwt in connection with the executive s initial employment with hwt 
of these  shares   were issued as restricted stock under the executive s employment agreement  and the remaining shares were purchased by the executive for per share in cash 
the restricted shares vest ratably over a period of four years 
our ownership percentage in hwt was reduced to as a result of the march issuance

we accounted for this gain as a component of stockholders equity due to losses incurred by hwt since inception 
equity investments as of december   we have no equity investments 
on october   we invested million in dream incubator  inc di  a management consulting company that develops strategies for e businesses in japan  and acquired a interest 
under the terms of our investment agreement with di  the company had one seat on di s board of directors  with special voting rights and other privileges  and  therefore  used the equity method of accounting for this investment 
in and  our equity ownership percentage in di was diluted from approximately to approximately  as a result of subsequent sales of di s common stock 
both rounds of financing by di were at a higher price per share than what we previously paid and we recorded non cash gains of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the change in equity interest 
during the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued its sapient kk operations in japan

on july   we reached an agreement with the management team of sapient spa  pursuant to which the management team acquired all of the shares of sapient spa from the shareholders of the joint venture and the joint venture agreement has been terminated 
the management team is the exclusive licensee of sapient s intellectual property in italy  and we are entitled to a royalty equal to of the annual revenue of sapient spa beginning july  we also have an option to purchase of the ownership of sapient spa  based on a formula which estimates fair value  among other rights 
the option is exercisable from july through july related party transactions we recognized approximately  and million in net revenues from consulting services provided to sapient spa in and  respectively 
in addition to recognizing revenue for services

table of contents years ended december  and service revenues service revenues for increased from service revenues for the increase in our service revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the demand for our services towards the end of  and to the effects of currency changes which accounted for of the increase 
following stabilization and modest growth in the demand for our services in the first three quarters of  we began to see increased growth in the fourth quarter of the percentage of our revenues attributable to support and maintenance projects is increasing  growing to of our total service revenues for  from for in each of the years and  our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  no client accounted for more than of such revenues and one client accounted for more than of such revenues 
project personnel costs  before reimbursable expenses project personnel costs  before reimbursable expenses  consist principally of salaries and employee benefits for personnel dedicated to client projects and direct expenses incurred to complete projects that were not reimbursed by the client 
these costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services 
project personnel costs  before reimbursable expenses  decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  due to improved utilization of our billable personnel over the course of the year 
due to the restructuring actions taken during  project personnel costs decreased over the course of  remained relatively unchanged in the first three quarters of  and increased in the fourth quarter to deliver on the increased demand for our services

table of contents restructuring and other related charges as a result of the decline in the demand for technology consulting services that began in the second half of  and the resulting decline in our service revenues in and  we restructured our workforce and operations in  and the second quarter of in connection with the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other related charges of approximately million 
this restructuring action resulted in the termination of employees 
this restructuring action was due to the skill sets of certain employees not matching our current business requirements and due to a significant decline in the demand for our services in our financial services business unit through the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other related charges of approximately million  primarily due to decreases in our estimated sub lease income in connection with the restructuring plans previously announced

the restricted shares vest ratably over a period of four years 
the related stock based compensation charge for was approximately  and approximately  per quarter for the next quarters will be expensed 
gain on equity investment change in interest in may  our equity ownership percentage in di was diluted from approximately to approximately  as a result of a public offering of di s common stock 
the dilution was due to the sale by di of shares to new investors  which occurred at a higher price per share than we previously paid and we recorded gains of million in in the fourth quarter of  we ceased using the equity method of accounting for our investment in di as a result of the dissolution of sapient kk  which resulted in us unwinding our strategic partnership with di and resigning our di board seat 
in november  we completed the sale of all of our remaining interest in di 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of realized gain and loss from disposition of our investment in shares of common stock of di 
in and  we realized gains on the sale of our di interest of approximately million and  respectively 
we classify all cost method equity investments of publicly traded companies as available for sale 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value as of each balance sheet date 
fair value is determined based on market quotations 
investments in equity securities for which fair value is not readily determinable are carried at cost 
if the fair value of the investment declines below cost  we consider available evidence  including the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is adjusted down to fair value and the adjustment is included in our consolidated statement of operations 
if the decline is considered temporary in nature  the adjustment is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
in and  we recorded charges of approximately  and  respectively  to write down certain investments we made in certain businesses because we considered the decline in the value of these investments to be other than temporary 
as of december   we have no equity investments 
interest income interest income is derived primarily from investments in us government securities  tax exempt  short term municipal bonds and commercial paper 
the decrease in interest income in from was due to the decrease in the average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates  offset in part by transferring investment balances to higher interest bearing taxable securities 
provision benefit for income taxes we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of net operating losses incurred in  and  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting

operating segments are defined as components of the company for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker 
management uses this information to manage resources and evaluate performance 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  we combined our automotive and industrial  consumer and transportation and energy services business units in the united states into one business unit called automotive  consumer and energy  and we are reporting our results by operating segments accordingly 
results for operating segments for have been reclassified to reflect these changes 
we do not allocate certain selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses to our business unit segments in the united states  because these activities are managed separately from the business units 
we did not allocate the costs associated with the restructuring plans across our operating segments for internal measurements purposes  given that the substantial majority of the restructuring costs represented consolidation of facilities 
we did allocate the workforce reduction costs associated with the restructuring activity in the second quarter of across our operating segments due to the specific identification of terminated employees to their respective individual operating segment 
we did not allocate the restructuring and other related charges recorded in the third quarter of across our operating segments as these charges resulted primarily from changes in estimated sub lease income in connection with the restructuring plans announced in and the table below presents the service revenues and operating income loss attributable to these operating segments for and in thousands

service revenues by operating segments consolidated service revenues for increased from service revenues for this was primarily due to increases in our united kingdom  germany  technology and communications  and public services business units  offset by declines in our financial services business unit 
our united kingdom  germany  technology and communications  and public services business units service revenues for increased million  million  million and million  respectively  from these increases were primarily due to increased revenues from large government  healthcare  communication  and energy clients and changes in currency rates in the uk and germany 
offsetting this increase  our financial services business unit s service revenues decreased  from million for to million for the economic downturn that occurred in and significantly affected our clients in the financial services industry  and  as a result  many of our clients in this industry decreased or delayed expenditures for technology consulting services 
we began to see improvements in technology spending in the financial services industry in the second half of  and we expect service revenues for our financial services business unit to increase in overall  of the increase in our revenues from to was attributable to changes in currency rates

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for the as compared to was primarily related to the cessation of amortization of goodwill as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we recorded approximately million of amortization of goodwill for we performed an impairment review of our goodwill as of january   under the transitional provisions of sfas we identified our reporting units  allocated assets and liabilities to the reporting units and performed impairment tests on the net goodwill associated with each of the reporting units by comparing the reporting units book value to their estimated fair value 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification  percentage of revenue and headcount 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated considering a market multiple of revenue approach 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill as of january   concluding that no impairment 
table of contents of the goodwill had occurred at that date 
by june   our stock price had declined significantly from january   at which point our market capitalization  based on our stock price  was below our book value  and we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed 
based on our analysis at june   the carrying amount of all reporting units exceeded their fair values and a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  for this charge represented of the goodwill balance at january  our japanese subsidiary did not have intangible assets and therefore goodwill amortization had no effect on discontinued operations 
also  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we determined that an interim impairment test of our long lived intangible assets at june  was necessary due to the significant decline in our market capitalization  as determined by our stock price 
utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for each long lived asset group  we determined that the expected undiscounted cash flows related to our long lived asset groups would not recover the carrying value of the assets over their remaining useful lives 
accordingly  we compared the carrying amounts of our long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
fair values were estimated using methods such as estimated replacement cost and relief from royalty 
based on the analysis at june   the fair values of certain intangible assets were below their carrying values and an impairment charge of million was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  for amortization expense related to the intangible assets was million and million for and  respectively 
stock based compensation the decrease in stock based compensation for the twelve months ended december  relative to the comparable period in was primarily due to the reduction of deferred compensation for people that were no longer employed by the company

upon the dissolution of our italian joint venture on july   we no longer have any variable interest entities 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab  which was effective upon issuance 
we adopted the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of our adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the demand for business and technology consulting services weakened significantly in and  and demand may remain weak if the current improvement in the economic climate does not continue 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions has changed rapidly over the last four years 
the market for advanced technology consulting services expanded dramatically during and most of  but declined significantly in and since the second half of  many companies have experienced financial difficulties or uncertainty  and canceled or delayed spending on technology initiatives as a result 
these companies typically are not demonstrating the same urgency regarding technology initiatives that existed during the economic expansion that stalled in this trend worsened for some companies following the september  terrorist attacks in the united states and the accounting scandals involving enron  worldcom and other companies 
the economic uncertainty caused by recent military actions in iraq further depressed technology spending 
although the economic climate has begun to show signs of improvement since the third quarter of  this improvement may not continue for a meaningful period of time 
if the economic climate does not improve significantly  large companies may continue to cancel or delay their business and technology consulting initiatives because of the weak economic climate  or for other reasons  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we currently compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms and clients internal information systems departments 
we also compete regularly with offshore outsourcing companies  and we expect competition from these companies to increase in the future  especially on development  application management services and outsourcing engagements 
we compete to a lesser extent with specialized e business consulting firms  strategy consulting firms and packaged technology vendors 
we compete frequently for client engagements against companies with far higher revenues and larger numbers of consultants than we have 
recent consolidations of large consulting companies within our market have further increased the size and resources of some of these competitors 
these competitors are often able to offer more scale  which in some instances has enabled them to significantly discount their services in exchange for revenues in other areas or at later dates 
additionally  in an effort to maintain market share  many of our competitors are heavily discounting their services to unprofitable levels 
some of our competitors have gone out of business 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our international operations and global distributed delivery model subject us to increased risk 
we currently have offices in the united kingdom  germany  india and canada 
our international operations are a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our global distributed delivery gdd model is a key component of our ability to successfully deliver our services 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in united states immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  us imposed restrictions on the import and export of technologies  and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our office in new delhi  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries could hinder our ability to successfully utilize gdd  and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations could affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international segment revenues were million in doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues  purchases  payroll and investments 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures are naturally offset within an international business unit  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk  because we frequently incur a significant portion of our project costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may adopt such strategies in the future 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from those subsidiaries to the parent company  and to other international subsidiaries  when it is cost effective to do so 
however  any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly personnel  rent and depreciation  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  
table of contents financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
we may lose money if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
most of our projects are based on fixed price  fixed time contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed time contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are increasingly entering into contracts for large projects  which magnifies this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
some of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
termination by any client of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff which were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by our services or by our failure to remedy system failures 
many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for defects in the applications or systems we provide  and carry insurance coverage which mitigates this liability in certain instances  we cannot be assured that these limitations and insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverages are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have begun to put a portion of our fees at risk based on project results and may not earn these fees if we do not succeed 
our business model focuses heavily on delivering measurable business results for our clients  and increasingly we are aligning our interests with our client s interests by putting a portion of our fees at risk  dependent on our client s attainment of the business value we promised 
in  we recognized  of revenue by achieving previously agreed measurable business results 
our inability to deliver the business value that we have promised on a project could materially affect the profitability of that project  because we typically will incur the same level of project costs regardless of whether the promised business value is attained 
we could also experience delays in revenue recognition or payment because the measurement of business value is often complex and may involve a verification process between us and our client 
as a result  our failure to deliver the business value that we promise to our clients could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may not be able to adequately perform our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
although we reduced our work force and slowed our hiring efforts in and  and many specialized e business and other business and technology companies did the same during this period  intense competition exists for employees who have specialized skills or significant experience in business and technology consulting 
the improvement in demand for business and technology consulting services that began in the third quarter of has also increased the need for highly skilled employees 
we expect to expand our operations in certain locations  including the united kingdom and india  and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our desired expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we are able to attract 
our rate of voluntary turnover decreased slightly to in the fourth quarter of from in the third quarter of  which is still above our targeted level  due to employees changing careers and increased travel requirements 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to adequately manage and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to hire expensive independent contractors  which could increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 

table of contents in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
relatively small adjustments to our reported financial results could result in a restatement or public disclosure because our operating results are currently near break even 
in the third quarter of  we had an operating loss of million and net income of million 
for the fourth quarter of  we had operating income of million and net income of million 
for all of  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss of million 
as a result  relatively small adjustments  while modest in absolute amount  discovered after reporting our financial results could be deemed to be material in the near term  because such adjustments may constitute a significant percentage of our results from operations or net income or loss 
any adjustments that are deemed to be material for this reason would likely require us to restate our financial results for the periods affected  which could cause fluctuations in our stock price 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in addition  although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future  and  if asserted  these claims may be successful 
a successful claim against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our co chairmen and co ceos have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen of the board of directors and co chief executive officers  own approximately of our common stock in the aggregate 
as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence  and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees  including messrs 
greenberg and moore 
our employment arrangements with messrs 
greenberg and moore and with our other key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
furthermore  for those employees whom we involuntarily terminated in connection with our restructuring actions  we have waived the non competition clause of their agreements in exchange for releases of claims 
we 
table of contents granted these waivers only in connection with the restructuring actions  and our general practice is not to waive the non competition obligations of other departing employees 
our corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt 
provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including a transaction in which stockholders would receive a premium for their shares

provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us
