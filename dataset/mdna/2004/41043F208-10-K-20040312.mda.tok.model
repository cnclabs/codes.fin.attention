item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated forward looking statements 
we are the largest operator and developer of orthotic and prosthetic o p patient care centers in the united states 
orthotics is the design  fabrication  fitting and device maintenance of custom made braces and other devices such as spinal  knee and sports medicine braces that provide external support to treat musculoskeletal disorders 
musculoskeletal disorders are ailments of the back  extremities or joints caused by traumatic injuries  chronic conditions  diseases  congenital disorders or injuries resulting from sports or other activities 
prosthetics is the design  fabrication and fitting of custom made artificial limbs for patients who have lost limbs as a result of traumatic injuries  vascular diseases  diabetes  cancer or congenital disorders 
we have two segments  the patient care services segment  which generated approximately of our net sales in  and the distribution of o p components segment  which accounted for of our net sales 
our operations are located in states and the district of columbia  with a substantial presence in california  florida  georgia  illinois  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
patient care we generate sales primarily from patient care services related to the fabrication  fitting and maintenance of o p devices 
same center sales growth represents the aggregate increase or decrease of our patient care centers sales in the current year compared to the preceding year 
patient care centers that have been owned by the company for at least one full year are included in the computation 
during  same center sales increased by over our net sales growth in was also principally driven by same center sales growth 
we acquired five additional patient care centers during we operated and patient care centers at december  and  respectively  and three distribution facilities at both december  and our revenues and results of operations are affected by seasonal considerations 
the adverse weather conditions often experienced in certain geographical areas of the united states during the first quarter of each year  together with a greater degree of patients sole responsibility for their insurance deductible payment obligations during the beginning of each calendar year  have generally contributed to lower net sales in the first quarter 
in our patient care segment  we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold 
estimated cost of goods sold is adjusted in the fourth quarter after the annual physical inventory is taken and compiled and a new accrual rate is established 
we believe that the expansion of our business through a combination of continued same center sales growth  which has averaged over the last three years  the addition of new facilities and a program of selective acquisitions are critical to the continued improvement in our profitability 
distribution southern prosthetic supply  inc sps  our distribution segment  is the largest distributor of o p devices in the united states 
sps had net sales of million in with million  or  of total net sales made to our patient care centers  and million  or  made to our competitors 
sps has three distribution centers strategically located in the united states 
sps is able to fill virtually any order within hours of receipt 
the ability to quickly fill orders allows us to maintain much lower levels of inventory in our patient care centers 
results and outlook net income did not meet management s expectations in due principally to disappointing sales growth in our patient care centers 
however  for the third consecutive year  we generated in excess of million in cash flows from operations and had available over million to pay down debt 
we also completed two finance transactions in the fourth quarter of that we expect will reduce interest expense and accreted dividends on our redeemable convertible preferred stock  and increase earnings per share in looking ahead  we expect to complete a major infrastructure project by the third quarter of with the rollout of our new billing system  o p s 
we also will continue to roll out our new insignia scanning system  which we believe will improve operations in our patient care centers 
we expect our continued investment in marketing  both in local sales force and in personnel and systems to support national contracts  will enable us to increase our market share in critical accounting estimates our analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we have chosen accounting policies within us gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note b to the consolidated financial statements as presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices and associated services to patients are recorded when the device is accepted by the patient provided that i there are no uncertainities regarding customer acceptance  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the sales price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is deemed probable 
revenue is recorded at its net realizable value taking into consideration all governmental and contractual adjustments and discounts 
subsequent to billing for our devices and services  disallowed sales may result if there are problems with pre authorization or with other insurance coverage issues with third party payors 
if these problems occur  they are recognized as reductions to sales 
revenue may be uncollectible  even if properly pre authorized and billed 
revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices to customers by our distribution segment are recorded upon the shipment of products  in accordance with the terms of the invoice  net of merchandise returns received and the amount established for anticipated returns 
discounted sales are recorded at net realizable value 
deferred revenue represents both deposits made prior to the final fitting and acceptance by the patient and prepaid tuition and fees received from students enrolled in our practitioner education program 
in the cases when valid revenue cannot be collected  a bad debt expense is recognized 
in addition to the actual bad debt expense encountered during collection activities  we estimate the amount of potential bad debt expense that may occur in the future 
this estimate is based upon our historical experience as well as a detailed review of our receivable balances 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
at our patient care centers segment  we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold during the current reporting periods 
estimated cost of goods sold during the period is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken 
we treat these adjustments as changes in accounting estimates in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting changes 
in and  unfavorable and favorable adjustments  respectively  were made in the fourth quarter as a result of completing the physical inventory 
at our distribution segment  a perpetual inventory is maintained 
management adjusts our reserve for inventory obsolescence whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying cost of certain inventory items is in excess of its market price 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
intangible assets excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to net identifiable assets of purchased businesses 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  annually 
any impairment would be recognized by a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
we completed the annual impairment test as of october   which did not result in the impairment of goodwill 
non compete agreements are recorded based on agreements entered into by us and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their terms ranging from five to seven years 
other definite lived intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these intangibles may not be recoverable  management reviews and assesses the future cash flows expected to be generated from the related intangible for possible impairment 
any impairment would be recognized as a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
deferred tax assets liabilities we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial accounting purposes than for income tax purposes 
deferred income taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
we recognize deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not the assets will be realized in future years

market risk we are exposed to the market risk that is associated with changes in interest rates 
in  we entered into million fixed to floating interest rate swaps  consisting of floating rate instruments benchmarked to libor 
the swaps were entered into in connection with the consummation of our million senior notes obligation in order to balance our exposure to fixed rate debt instruments 
during  we terminated the interest rate swaps and as a result  received million  which we will recognize as a reduction of interest expense  using the effective interest rate method  over the remaining term of the senior subordinated notes 
new accounting standards refer to our discussion of new accounting standards in note b of the audited consolidated financial statements 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations  as increased costs to us generally have been offset by increased prices of products sold
