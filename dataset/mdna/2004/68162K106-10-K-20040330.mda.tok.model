olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross profits 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit 
accordingly  the company s overall gross profit is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
in  gross profits declined primarily as a result of competitive pressures attributable to weak demand for steel during most of coupled with selling higher priced steel purchased during tight supply conditions experienced in during the first half of the company anticipates higher gross profits  resulting from its use of inventoried steel purchased prior to the recent increases in steel prices 
as the year continues and the company replenishes its inventories  the company expects its gross profit to decrease from that anticipated during the first half of the year 
the company performs toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by its detroit and georgia operations 
as of january   the company reclassified internal processing costs for toll processing sales from cost of materials sold to operating expenses

as a result  tubing s after tax operating losses of million in and thousand in are shown separate from the company s results from continuing operations 
in addition  a million after tax charge for the costs of the tubing closure is included in the consolidated statement of operations 
this non cash charge primarily relates to the write down of tubing s property and equipment to estimated fair value less costs to sell in accordance with sfas no 
the fair value of the tubing property and equipment was determined by independent appraisal 
in december  the company sold the tubing equipment for million its approximate appraised and net book value and used the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt 
the tubing real estate is recorded as assets held for sale on the accompanying december  consolidated balance sheet for thousand

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company monitors and evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
estimation of such losses requires adjusting historical loss experience for current economic conditions and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers 
the company can not guarantee that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
the company considers all available information when assessing each quarter the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
the company regularly reviews its inventory on hand and records provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and the company s customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes the company records operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the estimated effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in its consolidated balance sheets 
the company follows detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction when reviewing tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides for valuation allowances as required 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on historical taxable income  the expected reversals of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and projections of future taxable income 
the projections of future taxable income require assumptions regarding volume  selling prices  gross profits  expense levels and industry cyclicality 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  the company will be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s business has been impacted by decreasing volumes and fluctuating prices starting in the second half of and continuing through the third quarter of  due to softening demand from customers in the manufacturing sector of the us economy and domestic steel mill consolidation 
since the fourth quarter of  the company has experienced an increase in demand and prices for its products 
the company is unable to predict the duration of the current upturn in the economic cycle 
since the beginning of  steel producers have significantly increased prices and have imposed significant material surcharges  and there are indications of impending material shortages 
although the company has generally been successful in passing the increased costs and surcharges on to its customers  it is possible that the company may not be able to obtain all the material required by its customers or pass the increased material costs fully to its customers due to the competitive nature of the business 
the company is working closely with both customers and suppliers to minimize any negative impact 
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
the company has not entered into any interest rate or steel commodity hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy  and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
inflation has not had a material effect on the company s financial results during the past three years 
when raw material prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the steel price increases can be passed on to the company s customers 
when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower costed product result in lower selling prices 
declining steel prices have generally adversely affected the company s net sales and net income over the past three years 
olympic s primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to the company would be approximately million 
the company currently does not hedge its exposure to variable interest rate risk 
however  the company has the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under the new credit facility
