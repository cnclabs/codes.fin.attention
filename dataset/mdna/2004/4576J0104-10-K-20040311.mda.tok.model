information regarding certain other accounting policies is included in the notes to the company s financial statements 
long lived assets 
hotel properties are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
the company reviews its hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the value of the assets on our books may not be fully recoverable 
the company reviewed each of its hotel properties at december  for impairment and  based on its estimate of each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  determined that an impairment existed on three of its hotels at december  in determining each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  we made many assumptions and estimates  including the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holdings periods of the hotels  expected remaining useful lives of the hotels  future capital expenditure requirements  and fair value of the hotel upon disposition  if appropriate 
the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of on these three hotels 
if the company s estimate of the future cash flows of the hotels were to decrease in future periods  the company may be required to recognize further impairment charges in such periods and the impairment charges may be significant

capital expenditures the percentage leases generally require the company to make available an amount equal to or of room revenues from the hotels  on a monthly basis  for the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment and certain other capital expenditures at the hotels 
each of the company s term loans require that the company make available for such purposes  at the hotels collateralizing those loans  amounts up to of gross revenues from such hotels 
the company intends to cause the expenditure of amounts in excess of such obligated amounts  if necessary  to comply with the reasonable requirements of any franchise agreement and otherwise to the extent that the company deems such expenditures to be in the best interests of the company 
please also see business narrative description of business internal growth strategy capital improvements  renovation and refurbishment above 
management believes that the amounts required to be made available by the company under the percentage leases will be sufficient to meet most of the routine expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels 
however  in the past  the company has spent substantially more on capital expenditures than the percentage leases require 
management believed these additional expenditures were necessary to meet competitive pressures from other hotels  many of which are newly constructed 
in many cases  the expenditures were also required by franchisors of the hotels  such as marriott s requirements to substantially upgrade and refresh the company s generation residence inn by marriott hotels 
management believes that for the foreseeable future the company will continue to spend substantially more on capital expenditures than it is required to make available to the lessees under the percentage leases or loan agreements 
the extent to which the actual expenditures exceed the amounts required to be made available will vary from year to year  based on a number of factors 
those factors include  for any given year  market and franchisor requirements  the point in the normal recurring upgrade cycle the hotels are at in that year  and the revenue of the hotels for that year 
in  management expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
to the extent that the company spends more on capital expenditures than is available from the company s operations  the company intends to borrow under the line of credit

table of contents with respect to of the hotels  if the company were to sell those hotels in taxable transactions  the company would become liable for certain tax liabilities incurred by unit holders who exchanged interests in those hotels for units in the partnership when the company acquired the hotels 
the tax reimbursement liability with respect to a hotel is generally limited to a period within years of the hotel s acquisition date 
however  we cannot predict whether  when or to what extent the company may incur liability under these indemnifications 
seasonality of hotel business the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
historically  the hotels operations have generally reflected higher occupancy rates and adr during the second and third quarters 
to the extent that cash flow from the percentage leases for a quarter is insufficient to fund all of the operating expenses and distributions for such quarter due to seasonal and other factors  the company may fund quarterly operating expenses and distributions with available cash and or borrowings under the line of credit 
inflation operators of hotels  including the lessees and the ih manager  generally possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures and other factors have limited and may in the future limit the ability of the lessees and any third party managers retained by the lessees to raise room rates in response to inflation 
in fact  room rates have decreased over the last two years while inflation has been modest 
however  there can be no assurance that these modest inflation levels will not increase in future years or that the company will not continue to be constrained from raising room rates

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its line of credit and other debt 
at december   the company had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately  the company s interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps and treasury options or locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
currently  the company has no derivative financial instruments 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the following table presents principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands thereafter total fair value debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the future period  prevailing interest rates  and the company s hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements 
the company s line of credit  on which we currently have no outstanding borrowings  matures in july all of our other debt matures in or thereafter
