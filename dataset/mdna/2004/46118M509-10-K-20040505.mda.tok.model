item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a with our overall strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business is moving 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
in the next section  we discuss our results of operations for our fiscal year compared to our and fiscal years 
we then analyze our liquidity and capital resources and discuss relevant recent accounting pronouncements 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data 
the various sections of this md a contain a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the risk factors section 
our actual results may differ materially 
overview our goal is to be the preeminent digital entitlement and delivery services provider 
we are pursuing a three pronged strategy to achieve this goal 
first  we are seeking to solidify and strengthen our technological advantage by further improving our esdm technology solutions through internal research and development and through alliances with adjacent technology providers 
second  we are seeking to extend our customer base by strengthening our sales force  implementing new marketing programs focused on lead generation  offering new functional capabilities and pricing packages  and providing exceptional customer service 
third  we are working to become a profitable  cash generating company by growing our subscribenet business and practicing stringent fiscal responsibility 
we currently see a number of trends in the marketplace that are potentially important for our business 
first  the macroeconomy and the technology sector have improved in the past year 
however  the improvement seems tentative  apparently due in part to concerns about geopolitical instability and potential terrorist attacks  and spending by technology companies remains cautious 
second  in the past year there have been a number of mergers and acquisitions in the enterprise software sector 
these consolidations pose both opportunities and risks for us  potentially leading either to growth in our contracts with those customers or to cancellation of customer contracts 
third  technology companies are increasingly outsourcing operational functions to reduce costs 
our services enable enterprise software companies to outsource key operational functions in a manner that we believe is financially compelling 
therefore  we may benefit from this outsourcing trend 
fourth  the use of hosted web based applications  which in the past has been limited by concerns about speed  reliability and security  is now becoming more accepted among mainstream businesses  largely because of a desire for cost savings 
this trend may benefit us because our subscribenet service is a hosted web based application 
our management is focused on four key opportunities 
the first is what appears to be growing demand for electronic delivery and management of enterprise software applications 
the second opportunity is to further penetrate the enterprise software provider market by better integrating and cross selling our suite of services  including our subscribenet esdm service  our outsourced sales and marketing services  and the digital rights management and desktop update management and deployment services that we provide through strategic alliances 
the third opportunity is to continue expanding into vertical markets other than enterprise software  and into other untapped markets 
the fourth is to continue forging alliances with adjacent technology providers to build our market position and develop new revenue streams 
we also face a number of key risks  which are described in the risk factors beginning on page below 
we earn revenues and generate cash principally through recurring service fees charged for our subscribenet service  professional services fees charged for customization of our subscribenet service  and profit sharing and cost reimbursement received for our sales and marketing services 
we have also raised substantial amounts of cash through private stock placements 
in our most recent private stock placement  in september  we raised gross proceeds of approximately million through a sale of common stock to investment funds and accounts managed by apex capital  llc 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  prepaid licenses  services and costs of deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangibles  and income taxes to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition online services and technology revenue results primarily from three types of arrangements 
first  it results from sales of our subscribenet electronic software delivery and management service to software vendors and other companies that distribute software as part of their business 
second  it results from professional services that we provide to integrate our proprietary software  to convert data for customers  and to customize our subscribenet service for customers 
third  it results from the sale of our proprietary software licenses and related maintenance to companies using those products internally or using those products to provide web based services to their customers 
as a result of the sale of our asset management software business in may discussed below in results of operations  we are not currently deriving significant revenue from licenses for our proprietary software  however  we may recognize future revenues if we are able to sell licenses for our proprietary software underlying our subscribenet service and related maintenance 
we sell our subscribenet service  and will sell proprietary software licenses if opportunities present themselves  primarily through our direct sales force or through authorized resellers 
alliance and reimbursement revenue primarily relates to our alliance agreement with software spectrum for sales of sun software licenses and maintenance 
this revenue consists of a percentage of the gross profit derived from the sales of sun software licenses and maintenance services  and reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to selling sun software for software spectrum 
this revenue is recognized as we provide the services to software spectrum 
we derive software product revenues from resold licenses and maintenance for multiple business software product lines 
as of july   we generally no longer resell third party software licenses and maintenance  though we still resell licenses for third party products complementary to our subscribenet service 
we continue to recognize revenue from third party software licenses and related maintenance contracts over the life of the arrangements made prior to july  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance element of the resold software arrangements is based on historical and contractual renewal rates for maintenance 
we defer the maintenance revenue at the outset of the arrangement and recognize it ratably over the period during which the maintenance is to be provided generally months  which normally commenced on the date the software was delivered 
we defer online services and technology revenues related to esdm and generally recognize them ratably over the term of the service arrangement 
some subscribenet services provided to new customers involve implementation or customization activities essential to the functionality of our subscribenet services 
in those cases  we defer revenue recognition until the services go live date is reached and recognize the revenue on a ratable basis over the remaining contract term 
the go live date is the date on which the essential functionality has been delivered or on which the website through which the service is provided enters the production environment  or the point at which no additional customization is required  whichever is later 
we typically rely on a negative confirmation from the customer to indicate acceptance of the implementation of the service 
if customers were to subsequently indicate that services have not been completed  this could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
when we sell additional professional services related to the original subscribenet agreement  we defer revenue recognition until the services go live date is reached in the same manner as the overall subscribenet services noted above 
this revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the remaining estimated customer life or the remaining contract term  commencing with the delivery of the additional services 
estimated customer life requires that we periodically estimate the projected life of our existing customers  based on historical information  such as customer renewal rates 
since revenues generated from additional professional services represent less than of our overall revenues for the year ended february   any change to our estimated customer life is unlikely to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we have provided the service to the customer  made the software available for customer download through our website  or shipped the software to the customer  we believe that collection of these fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
revenue from transactions through authorized resellers has been recognized when the licenses and maintenance have been resold or utilized by the reseller or when our related obligations have been satisfied 
these transactions primarily related to asset management software licenses and maintenance resold 
during the year ended february   we sold our asset management software business to computer associates international  inc  as discussed in note to our notes to consolidated financial statement in item below 
we base vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance element of the proprietary software arrangements on historical and contractual renewal rates for maintenance 
we defer the maintenance revenue at the outset of the arrangement and recognize it ratably over the period during which the maintenance is to be provided generally months  which normally commences on the date the software is delivered 
as mentioned above  a determination that the collection of fees is probable is a precursor to recognizing revenue 
determination of collectability of payments requires judgment on the part of management and includes periodically evaluating customers credit see allowance for doubtful accounts below 
prepaid licenses  services and costs of deferred revenue as part of our earlier business of reselling third party software  we purchased prepaid licenses for resale 
these costs are recognized over the same term as the associated revenue from licenses resold 
we wrote down those prepaid licenses for estimated obsolescence in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the prepaid licenses and the estimated recoverable value based on assumptions about future demand  market conditions and our rights to return the licenses 
if actual future demand or market conditions had been less favorable than those we projected  additional prepaid license write downs may have been required 
as of july   we generally ceased reselling third party software licenses  though we still resell licenses for third party products complementary to our subscribenet service see revenue recognition above 
during the year ended february   we recorded zero prepaid license write downs 
at february   we had approximately million in prepaid licenses  which represents the cost of resold third party licenses sold prior to july  in addition  we capitalize deferred costs of revenues related to significant implementation and professional services contracts associated with our subscribenet services 
these costs are recognized over the same term as the associated revenue from those contracts see revenue recognition above 
any change in our revenue recognition estimates could result in corresponding changes to our recognition of costs of deferred revenues 
at february   we had approximately million in capitalized costs of deferred revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our inability to collect required payments from our customers 
when evaluating the adequacy of this allowance  we analyze specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment history 
there is no assurance that we will not need to record increases to our allowance balances in the future 
we have many accounts receivable balances and one large unbilled receivable balance  and any dispute  early contract termination or other collection issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operations 
at february   our unbilled receivable balance was million 
there are no allowances for doubtful accounts related to our unbilled accounts receivable balance 
this balance relates to our software spectrum agreement see revenue recognition above 
this estimate involves management s judgment  which takes into account their prior payment history  current credit worthiness and overall business condition 
changes in the above factors could have a material impact on actual bad debts incurred 
goodwill and intangibles as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below  we are required to regularly review all of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill balances were reviewed for impairment at least once annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that an impairment review for intangible and long lived assets is necessary based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the book value of such assets to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets 
if the book value is greater than the future undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
when we determine an impairment review of goodwill is necessary based on an impairment indicator or based on our annual testing requirements  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment may be necessary 
significant judgment is required in the development of projected cash flows for these purposes  including assumptions regarding the appropriate level of aggregation of cash flows  their term and discount rate as well as the underlying forecasts of expected future revenue and expense 
during fiscal year  our remaining goodwill and intangibles were included in our calculation of the gain on sale of our asset management software business  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing our financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
given that we have incurred losses since inception and therefore have not been required to pay income taxes  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at february  in the event that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period that this is determined 
results of operations total revenue the following table sets forth the revenue  changes in revenue and percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands for the years ended february february february total change of revenue total change of revenue total of revenue revenues software product sales    online services and technology   alliance and reimbursement    related party online services and technology total revenues     revenues for combined online services and technology and related party online service and technology revenue for the year ended february   increased slightly from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased subscribenet revenues from existing customers of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in revenue from our services agreement with sun microsystems  inc of million for the year ended february  as of march   sun no longer receives the subscribenet service 
the portion of our services agreement with sun related to our electronic fulfillment of initial sun software license sales will remain in effect through june  however  the fees payable by sun for our fulfillment services were reduced substantially effective march  the decrease in combined online services and technology revenue for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to our sale of our asset management software business in may  which resulted in a reduction of approximately million in combined online services and technology revenue 
we expect our combined online services and technology revenue and related party online services and technology revenue in our first quarter of fiscal year to be slightly higher than those in our fiscal quarter ended february  the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
alliance and reimbursement revenue primarily relates to our alliance agreement with software spectrum for sales of sun software licenses and maintenance 
this revenue consists of a percentage of the gross profit derived from the sales of sun software licenses and maintenance services  and reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to selling sun software for software spectrum 
the decrease in alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february   was primarily due to a reduction of the shared gross profit derived from the sales of sun software licenses and maintenance services of million 
the increase in alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february  is primarily due to fact that our agreement with software spectrum did not go into effect until june  approximately four months into our fiscal year ended february  we expect our alliance and reimbursement revenues in our first quarter of fiscal year to be lower than those in our three months ended february  due to seasonality and forecasted reduced demand for sun products 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the decline in software product revenue and the majority of the decline in total revenue for the years ended february  and february   was due to our transition out of the business of reselling third party software products and related maintenance 
we expect our third party product revenue to continue to decrease as a result of this transition 
however  we may recognize future revenues from products and services complementary to our subscribenet service  which originate with other companies and are sold to customers through us as part of a comprehensive esdm business solution 
the previous two sentences are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated for the years ended february  february  february  gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles amortization of goodwill restructuring impairment of assets loss on abandonment of assets total operating expenses cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended february   from million for the year ended february   and million for the year ended february  the decreases in cost of revenues are primarily due to the phasing out of our third party software reseller business  which resulted in decreases of million and million in cost of revenues for the years ended february  and february  our gross margin increased to for the year ended february   from for the year ended february   and for the year ended february  the gross margin increases primarily reflect our focus on the sale of our own services and technology  which generate higher margins than third party products we resold 
cost of revenues primarily consists of certain allocated costs related to our purchase of bandwidth services to support software delivery through our subscribenet service and data center services to support our subscribenet service  equipment and other infrastructure that we purchase and maintain to support our sales and support teams  and customer support and the costs associated with maintaining our sales team dedicated to selling sun software for which software spectrum reimburses us 
cost of revenues also consists of professional services personnel costs and the cost of third party products sold 
we generally purchased such third party products at a discount to the third party s established list prices according to standard reseller terms 
we expect our overall cost of revenues and gross profit margin percentage to increase over our fiscal year levels 
however  the actual mix of sales transactions and the timing of the transactions may cause our cost of revenues and gross profit margins to fluctuate materially from those anticipated 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february   sales and marketing expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  advertising  promotional materials and trade show expenses 
the decrease in the dollar amount and percentage of revenue of our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to our restructuring efforts in connection with the sale of our asset management software business in may  which reduced expenditures on salaries and marketing  and eliminated rent on closed offices for a total of approximately million in reduced expenses 
the decrease is also attributable to reduced stock based employee compensation expense of million 
the decrease in the dollar amount of our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   is also due to our restructuring efforts and the sale of our asset management software business in may  which reduced expenditures on salaries and marketing  and eliminated rent on closed offices for a total of approximately million in reduced expenses 
we plan to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing in fiscal year over those in fiscal year  both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue 
we plan to continue to market and sell our services  and may market and sell proprietary software licenses  directly to customers using our existing sales force 
we also plan to continue to develop additional business relationships to sell our services to a broader customer base 
the previous three sentences are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
product development expenses for the year ended february   product development expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  product development expenses primarily consist of personnel  consulting  software and related maintenance  equipment depreciation expenses and allocated overhead costs 
costs related to research  design and development of products and services have been charged to product development expense as incurred 
the decrease in the dollar amount and percentage of revenue of our product development expenses for the year ended february   compared to those for the year ended february   is primarily due to our restructuring efforts in connection with the sale of our asset management software business in may  which eliminated expenditures on salaries and consulting fees for asset management software development personnel of million  reduced software and related maintenance and equipment depreciation expenses through the disposal or retirement of software and equipment of million  and reduced stock based employee compensation expense of million 
the decrease in the dollar amount of our product development expenses for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   was primarily due to reductions in payroll and related expenses of million  a significant portion of which related to our restructuring efforts and the sale of our asset management software business in may the decrease was also due to a decrease in software and related maintenance and equipment depreciation expense of million 
we anticipate continuing to invest in additional functionality for our subscribenet service and underlying proprietary software 
however  we expect those investments to fluctuate over time  and expect our product development expenses to fluctuate accordingly 
we expect total product development expenditures to be lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year  both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue 
we cannot give assurance that our product development efforts will result in new or improved products  features or functionality or that the market will accept the improvements to existing or new products  features or functionality developed 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended february   general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue  an increase from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative and executive personnel  fees for professional services  uncollectible accounts and certain allocated overhead costs 
a significant part of the increase in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended february   is the reduction in recovery of accounts previously written off  as compared to our higher recovery of such accounts during the year ended february  during our fiscal year  we wrote off accounts that were deemed to be uncollectible at that time 
however  we continued to pursue collection efforts and ultimately succeeded in recovering amounts from that time period 
during the year ended february   we recovered approximately million more than in the year ended february  these recoveries were partially offset by reductions in payroll related expenses of million and external personnel costs and state administrative fees of million 
the decrease in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to increased recoveries of accounts previously written off as described in the preceding paragraph of approximately million during the year ended february  in addition  we recognized decreases in payroll related expenses of approximately million 
we expect total expenditures in fiscal year to approximate fiscal year levels 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
august restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets on august   we announced a strategic reorganization 
we recorded a charge of million relating to this restructuring and the loss on abandonment of assets during the quarter ended august  the loss on abandonment of assets included the write off of approximately million of property and equipment and certain intangibles relating to our acquisition of bitsource  inc  as we abandoned the related technology 
the write off consisted of the following components million for property and equipment  million for trademarks  million for goodwill  and million for existing technology 
the property and equipment written off included assets taken out of service  as they were deemed unnecessary due to our workforce reductions 
these assets were subsequently disposed of or sold 
included in this write off were furniture and fixtures that were written down to a net realizable value of approximately  the restructuring consisted of approximately  for severance and benefits relating to the involuntary termination of employees  all of whom were based in north america 
we reduced our workforce to employees from at the end of july of the terminated employees  were in sales and marketing  were in product development and were in general and administrative 
we also consolidated our two san francisco bay area offices into one 
we accrued lease and related costs of approximately million principally pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities in the san francisco bay area that were vacated due to the workforce reduction 
we also recognized an additional  relating to other restructuring expenses 
due to changes in management s estimates relating to our strategic reorganization on august   we recognized additional expenses of approximately  during the three months ended november  this additional charge principally related to the acquisition of the title to assets held under a capital lease 
in connection with our restructuring efforts we recorded a charge of approximately  relating to the fair value of an option issued to a consultant on september   for services performed in conjunction with exiting our excess lease space 
we issued a fully vested and immediately exercisable option to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the term of the option is ten years 
the following assumptions were used to value the option under the black scholes option pricing model term of years  fair value of the stock price on the grant date of  option exercise price of per share  volatility of  and a zero dividend yield 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring and loss on abandonment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal and subsequent adjustments and payments made against the reserve in thousands severance and benefits asset write offs excess lease and related costs other costs total august  restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets total    cash paid non cash charges   reserve balance at august    cash paid non cash charges provision adjustment reserve balance at november    cash paid   reserve balance at february  may restructuring and sale of asset management software business in may  we sold substantially all of the assets related to our asset management software business to computer associates international  inc for approximately million in cash 
in connection with this sale  our july agreement with computer associates for its resale of our argis suite of software products was terminated 
in addition  as part of that asset sale  we assigned to computer associates our may agreement with corporate software now software spectrum for its resale of our argis suite of software products 
because of the asset sale  software spectrum has the right to terminate that agreement 
if it does so  all of the shares subject to the warrant that we issued to software spectrum in may will immediately become exercisable 
we recorded the fair value of the warrant as prepaid distribution costs and were recognizing it as a reduction of revenue over the lesser of a ratable charge over the month term of the agreement with software spectrum or the period it took software spectrum to generate revenue to intraware of million from software spectrum s resale of our asset management software 
as a result of the asset sale  we recorded the remaining unamortized prepaid distribution costs of  as a reduction to revenue during the year ended february  we recorded the total proceeds from the sale of million  less the book value of transferred equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  deferred revenue  and transaction costs  based on their respective carrying values at the sale date  as a gain on sale of assets in the year ended february  we determined the calculation of the gain on the sale as follows in thousands total consideration  net book value of equipment  intangible assets and deferred revenue transaction costs gain on sale  in connection with our disposition of the asset management software business  we announced a restructuring and workforce reduction to reduce our operating expenses 
we recorded a charge of million relating to this restructuring and the impairment of assets during the three months ended may  the impairment of assets includes the write off of approximately  in prepaid licenses that were held for resale 
the restructuring charge consisted of approximately  for severance and benefits relating to the involuntary termination of employees who were not hired by computer associates 
we terminated an additional employees  all of whom were based in north america 
these terminated employees were all hired by computer associates and therefore received no severance payments 
overall  we reduced our workforce to employees from in connection with the asset sale to computer associates 
of the terminated employees  were in sales and marketing  were in product development and were directly involved in our product support 
we also closed our pittsburgh  pennsylvania office and various satellite offices 
we accrued for lease and related costs of approximately  principally pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities that were vacated due to our workforce reductions 
we also recognized  relating to other restructuring expenses 
due to changes in management s estimates relating to the restructuring during the three months ended august   we recognized an additional expense of  pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities that were vacated due to our workforce reductions 
in addition  we did not incur projected severance and benefits of  and reduced the reserve accordingly 
during the three months ended february   we agreed with the landlord to terminate our pittsburgh  pennsylvania lease and realized a savings of approximately  that would otherwise have been payable as rent under the lease 
in our december restructuring  we closed our fremont  california office and assigned our lease to a new tenant while acting as guarantor for that tenant 
in may  the new tenant defaulted on its lease 
during the three months ended november   we made a cash payment of approximately  to terminate this lease

amortization of intangibles and goodwill for the year ended february   amortization of intangibles and goodwill was zero  a decrease from million for the year ended february   and million for the year ended february  amortization of intangibles and goodwill related to our acquisitions of bitsource  inc in october and janus technologies  inc 
in july on march   we ceased amortization of our goodwill balance of million 
subsequently  in may  as part of our asset management software business sale to computer associates  we included our remaining intangible assets and goodwill in the determination of the gain on sale 
interest expense for the year ended february   interest expense was million  a decrease from million for both the years ended february  and interest expense relates to obligations under capital leases  notes payable and borrowings under a bank line 
the decrease in interest expense from february  and is primarily the result of accrued interest and accretion to redemption value related to our million in notes payable  which were fully converted or paid off in the first quarter of fiscal year interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   interest and other income and expenses  net was a  credit  a decrease from a  credit for the year ended february   and an increase from a net charge of million for the year ended february  interest and other income and expenses  net primarily relates to interest earned on our investment balances and warrants recorded as liabilities adjusted to fair value 
the increase in interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   is primarily due to the fact that we did not incur any credits to adjust any warrants to fair value 
the increase in interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   is primarily the result of the decrease in the charges recorded to adjust the warrants we issued in connection with our august and september   debt issuances  and our may   common stock financing to fair value 
all warrants have been reclassified to permanent equity and will no longer be adjusted to fair value 
income taxes from inception through february   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of february   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  which expire in varying amounts between and because of cumulative ownership changes  federal loss carryforwards totaling approximately million and state loss carryforwards totaling approximately million are subject to limitation 
at february   million and million of federal and state net operating losses  respectively  are available  without limitation to offset future taxable income 
should there be a change of ownership in the future  the available net operating losses may be further limited 
given our limited operating history  losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  management does not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax asset meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents our liquidity position at the end of our fiscal years and in thousands for the years ended february  february  cash and cash equivalents   working capital   net cash used in operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities  net cash provided by financing activities  we significantly improved our cash used in operations in fiscal year by reducing operating expenditures 
however  we still used million in cash to support our operations in our fiscal year this cash came from our existing cash and cash equivalents  and from our issuance of common stock in a private placement in september due in large part to this financing  we ended the year with million in cash  as compared to million at the end of the prior year 
we expect to continue to improve our cash used in operations by increasing our billings to customers as more subscribers are added to our esdm service 
we plan to use part of those expected increased cash receipts in additional sales and marketing expenditures to expand our market reach 
our ability to improve our uses of cash and generate positive cash flows in future periods will largely depend on our ability to increase the number of customers of our subscribenet service while increasing existing subscriptions through strong contract renewals 
it is also important for us to maintain our current level of sales through our software spectrum sales alliance  and continue to control our operational and customer support costs in the coming year 
our net cash used in operations was million for the year ended february   down from million net cash used in operations in the year ended february  this decrease was primarily due to approximately million in reductions in payroll related expenditures and million in reduced restructuring cash payments see may restructuring and sale of asset management software business above 
our net cash used in operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss for the year 
the majority of our operating costs continue to relate to employee payroll and related expenditures 
our net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended february  most of this amount came from a private placement of common stock we completed in september in that financing  we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
part of that million amount also came from our issuance of about million shares of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises for proceeds of approximately million 
in august  we entered into an agreement with a bank under which we issued a note payable for proceeds of approximately million and obtained access to a  line of credit 
the note payable bears an annual interest rate of the greater of in excess of the bank s prime rate at february  or 
we used the proceeds from the note payable to settle our remaining liability under a capital lease bearing an interest rate of approximately 
this refinancing enabled us to significantly reduce our monthly capital financing and interest expenditures 
the line of credit allows us to draw  through august  for equipment purchases at the same interest rate that applies to the note payable 
under the agreement for the note payable and line of credit  all borrowings are collateralized by a senior security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the agreement also requires us to comply with financial covenants  with which we complied as of february  the agreement further restricts us from incurring or assuming additional indebtedness outside of this note payable and line of credit  excluding trade payables and certain other liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business 
during the year ended february   we made million in capital lease payments  of which million was for our settlement of the capital lease described above 
as of february   we had extinguished all of our capital lease liabilities  and our only capital financing arrangements were the note payable and line of credit described above 
our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended february   included million for our purchase of fixed assets 
we originally paid for these equipment purchases from our cash and cash equivalents  but later drew down  under the above mentioned line of credit to finance these purchases 
we used these fixed asset purchases primarily to upgrade and expand our subscribenet infrastructure and corporate information systems 
we expect to continue to use and renew our line of credit to finance additional fixed asset purchases at levels that approximate or are slightly higher than our prior year levels 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and financing arrangements for the foreseeable future 
however  if our subscribenet business fails to grow significantly or declines from its current level  we could be forced to seek additional capital 
at february   we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following table summarizes our debt and lease obligations at february   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
this table provides information through our year ending february   as we do not have any debt or lease obligations beyond that point 
payments due by period total bank notes payable   a operating leases b a this amount includes approximately  in interest 
b this amount excludes approximately     and  per year for the periods of through  which would become due and payable if we do not exercise our right to exit our operating lease for our orinda office 
in addition  this amount excludes potential sublease receipts 
as of february   our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock entitled its holders to a liquidation preference of million in the event of intraware s liquidation 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 
on a model to be used to determine when a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units 
the eitf also reached a consensus that this guidance should be effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities vie  an interpretation of arb no 
fin and in december  issued a revised interpretation fin r 
fin no 
 as revised  requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  for arrangements entered into prior to february   we are required to adopt the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of our fiscal year the adoption of fin r is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to the first interim period beginning after june  while the effective date of certain elements of sfas no 
have been deferred  the adoption of sfas no 
when finalized is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab which superseded sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not materially affect our revenue recognition policies  or our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the eitf issued statement no 
participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share eitf 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of a company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  we are currently evaluating the effect of adopting eitf risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing intraware 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations 
if any of the events  contingencies  circumstances or conditions described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
if that occurs  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
revenues to us under our sales and marketing services arrangement with software spectrum are likely to decline over the long term 
also  any termination of our relationship with software spectrum in the near term  without an adequate replacement  would cause a substantial decrease in our revenues 
under our june agreement with software spectrum  we provide sales and marketing services to software spectrum to assist in its resale and marketing of sun and websense software licenses and maintenance 
software spectrum shares with us a portion of its gross profit from resales of sun and websense software licenses and maintenance  and reimburses us for a substantial portion of our cost of maintaining a team dedicated to sales and marketing of that software and maintenance 
this contract accounted for substantially all of our alliance and reimbursement revenues  a significant portion of our online services and technology revenues  and more than of our total revenues in our fiscal year see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
however  in recent years  sales and market share of the sun software product lines that we resell with software spectrum have generally declined 
if this trend continues  revenues to us under this contract are likely to decrease over the long term 
in addition  the term of this agreement will expire in june and is renewable for subsequent one year terms 
it is possible that software spectrum will choose not to renew this agreement at any of those points 
it is also possible that sun and or websense will choose to stop permitting software spectrum to resell their software 
any non renewal of our agreement with software spectrum  or termination of software spectrum s rights to resell sun software  would likely cause a substantial and immediate decrease in our revenues 
the loss of one or more of our key customers or partners could cause our revenue growth to slow or cause our revenues to decline 
a substantial amount of the revenues from our subscribenet service come from a relatively small number of companies 
these include software providers to whom we provide our subscribenet service  as well as software spectrum  to whom we provide both our subscribenet service and sales and marketing services 
our contracts with most of these companies are subject to renewal or cancellation annually 
if any of these companies elected to cancel their agreements with us  our revenue growth would likely slow or our revenues might decline 
in april  zomax and intraware terminated our august strategic alliance agreement  under which zomax paid us an aggregate of million in annual subscribenet license fees over two years 
we replaced that agreement with a new reseller agreement under which zomax does not pay us annual license fees  but rather pays us for services as they are provided 
we have a history of losses and negative cash flow  and we have yet to achieve sustained profitability or positive cash flow 
we plan to increase spending on sales and marketing  which could limit or prevent any near term improvement in our net income and cash flow 
we have incurred significant losses since we were formed in  and have yet to achieve sustained profitability or positive cash flow 
as of february   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
also  with the exception of our quarter ended november   we have not achieved positive cash flow since our formation in our operating history  combined with our plans to increase investments in sales and marketing programs  make it difficult to evaluate whether or when we will be able to achieve sustained profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
to help us achieve our long term revenue and profit goals  we plan to increase our spending on sales and marketing activities and programs 
we believe these investments will contribute to improved financial performance over the longer term 
however  in the near term this increase in our costs may limit our gross profit margins and limit or prevent any improvement in our net income and cash flows 
competition from other electronic software delivery service providers  and potential customers development of their own electronic software delivery systems  could limit our revenue growth and reduce our gross margins 
the market for selling electronic software delivery services is highly competitive 
we believe we compete effectively because of the technology  performance  features  functionality  and open architecture of our subscribenet service  as well as its pricing and demonstrated return on investment 
however  some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product and service offerings  better name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
some of our competitors also have well established relationships with our potential customers and with third party information technology or consulting firms that help market our competitors services 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand and improve their service offerings and new competitors enter the market 
mergers and consolidation in the information technology industry may also increase competition by enlarging our competitors and their product and service offerings  and or by reducing the pool of potential customers 
in addition  our current and potential customers are primarily information technology companies with strong software development expertise 
when considering their alternatives for implementing an electronic software delivery and management system  these companies sometimes elect to develop such systems in house 
while we believe our competitive position is strong against both external competitors and in house development  we have at times experienced reduced prices  reduced gross margins and lost sales as a result of such competitive factors 
it is possible that such competition will intensify and thereby limit the growth of our revenues and gross margins 
our operating results may fluctuate in future periods  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have been in the past  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of a number of factors 
in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  those factors include fluctuations in demand for the sun software we resell jointly with software spectrum  for which we recognize revenue based largely on sales during the reported period  unlike our subscribenet fees which we generally recognize ratably over the term of our customer agreements  deferral of subscribenet revenue recognition due to delays by customers in implementing the subscribenet service  new sales involving extensive implementations  or contract modifications adding future deliverables  changes in sales and implementation cycles for our subscribenet service  the overall trend toward industry consolidation both among our customers and our competitors  actual events  circumstances  outcomes  and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances  liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and changes in accounting rules  such as recording expenses for employee stock option grants 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict  and therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 
the technological and functional requirements we must meet to stay competitive are subject to rapid change 
if we are unable to quickly adapt to these changes and meet the demands of our current and potential customers  we will likely lose sales and market share and our revenue growth will be limited 
we market primarily to software providers  who generally demand that a service like ours meet high technological and functional standards 
to remain competitive in this market and meet the demands of current and prospective customers  we must continually adapt and upgrade our technology and functionality 
if we do not respond quickly enough to changing industry standards or the demands of customers and potential customers  we will likely lose sales and market share to competitors and our growth prospects will be limited 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to changing standards and demands 
if we incur such costs but our sales fail to increase commensurately  our goals of sustained profitability and positive operating cash flow will become more difficult to achieve 
viruses and potential security breaches may hinder acceptance of internet based electronic software delivery and management  which could in turn limit our revenue growth 
use of the internet for business purposes poses several risks that could inhibit acceptance by information technology professionals of web based electronic software delivery and management 
the proliferation of software viruses is a key risk 
any well publicized transmission of a computer virus by us or another company using electronic software delivery could deter information technology professionals from using and deter software providers from outsourcing electronic software delivery  thereby adversely affecting our business 
our subscribenet service enables our customers to upload their software products directly onto our systems for downloading by their end users 
our systems automatically scan our customers software products for known computer viruses on an ongoing basis while they are on our systems 
however  it is possible that  in spite of those periodic virus scans  our system could transmit the virus to one or more end users 
any such virus transmission could result in disputes  litigation and negative publicity that could adversely affect our business 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of our subscribenet service 
we believe the security precautions we employ to protect our customers and their end users confidential files and information are effective 
however  extremely sophisticated means have been used to breach the security of other companies and governmental agencies 
if we experience a security breach that affects one or more of our customers or their end users  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any well publicized compromise of security in our industry could deter information technology professionals from using and deter software providers from outsourcing electronic software delivery  thereby adversely affecting our business 
we may raise additional capital to fund acquisitions  product development or general operations 
any such capital financing would dilute our shareholders investments 
we may raise additional capital in the future through private or public offerings of stock  or through other means 
the purposes of any such financing would be to increase our cash reserves for potential use in acquiring other businesses  product development activities  funding our operations and generally strengthening our balance sheet 
any such additional financing would likely dilute the investments of our current shareholders 
additional government regulations may harm demand for our services and increase our costs of doing business 
our business has benefited from the tax laws of states in which purchases of software licenses are not taxable if the software is received only electronically 
some states currently experiencing revenue shortfalls are considering whether to change their laws to broaden the taxability of transactions executed over the internet 
any new imposition of taxes on sales of software licenses  where the software is received electronically  could substantially harm demand for our services and thereby materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have also benefited from implementing our services in ireland  which offers tax advantages to software companies distributing their software from ireland to other european countries 
any regulatory change in ireland or elsewhere that diminishes those advantages could harm our business 
other changes in government regulations  in areas such as privacy and export compliance  could also require us to implement changes in our services or operations that increase our cost of doing business and thereby negatively affect our financial performance 
claims by third parties for intellectual property infringement could force us to stop selling our services  force us to pay royalties  and force us to indemnify our customers 
we electronically deliver third party software to end users 
this activity creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through our contractual indemnification obligations to our customers 
any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these claims could be made for defamation  negligence  patent  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content or copying of these materials 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries 
we expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
there can be no assurance that our services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  we may be involved in litigation involving the software of third party vendors that we have electronically distributed in the past 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us could adversely affect our business 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover all potential claims or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
we take steps to verify that end users who download third party software through our subscribenet service are entitled to deploy and use that software 
however  there can be no assurance that this verification procedure will help us defend against claims by  or protect us against liability to  the owners of copyrights in that third party software 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we are aware that certain other companies are using or may have plans to use the name intraware as a company name or as a trademark or service mark 
while we have received no notice of any claims of trademark infringement from any of those companies  we cannot assure you that these companies may not claim superior rights to intraware or to other marks we use 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
if our export compliance system fails to prevent unauthorized exports of our customers software  we could be sanctioned by the us government 
through our subscribenet service we globally distribute software containing high encryption and other features restricted by us laws and regulations from exportation to certain countries  types of recipients  and specific end users 
our subscribenet solution incorporates automated procedures to help ensure that the software we deliver electronically is not downloaded in violation of us export laws and regulations 
however  these procedures may not prevent unauthorized exports of restricted software in every case 
if an unauthorized export of software occurs through the subscribenet service and the us government determines that we violated the us export laws or regulations  we could be sanctioned under those laws or regulations 
sanctions include fines  suspension or revocation of export privileges  and imprisonment 
if our key personnel left the company  our product development  sales  and corporate management could suffer 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lost the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at the end of fiscal year  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio during fiscal we place our investments with high quality issuers  by policy  in an effort to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our cash and cash equivalents portfolio 
at february   our cash and cash equivalents portfolio totalled million 
the effect of changes in interest rates of over a six month horizon would not have a material effect on the fair value of the portfolio
