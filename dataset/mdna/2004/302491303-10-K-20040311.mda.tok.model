item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company we are a diversified  global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets 
we operate in three business segments agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals 
agricultural products principal focus is on insecticides  which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests  and on herbicides  which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth 
specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture  structure and physical stability  pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage 
our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials  including soda ash  peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 
agricultural products our agricultural products segment manufactures and sells proprietary  branded insecticides and herbicides 
we have a strong position in two widely used classes of insecticides  pyrethroids and carbamates  and possess a niche portfolio of proprietary herbicides 
these products are used for the protection of cotton  corn  rice  cereals  vegetables and other crops 
in addition  in north america we sell into the professional pest control and home and garden markets 
we differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions  and by leveraging proprietary chemistries and pest specific research and development r d to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products 
we have also developed strategic alliances with companies such as ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd 
isk  a japanese crop protection company  to access new markets and develop new insecticides 
specialty chemicals our specialty chemicals segment is comprised of our biopolymer and lithium businesses 
biopolymer manufactures and sells microcrystalline cellulose  carrageenan and alginates  products that add texture  structure and physical stability to a wide range of beverage  dairy  meat and bakery products and or that act as binders and disintegrants for tablets and capsules 
our lithium business is a technology based business in which mined lithium is processed and sold for use in a broad array of specialty products  including pharmaceuticals  specialty polymers and energy storage devices 
the majority of specialty chemicals sales are to customers engaged in non cyclical end markets  such as food and pharmaceuticals 
industrial chemicals our industrial chemicals segment manufactures soda ash  peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 
through our manufacturing facility in green river  wyoming  we process naturally occurring soda ash  a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass 
we produce hydrogen peroxide  leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout north america to reach our customers 
we also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics  polymers and food processing industries 
our european subsidiary  fmc foret  sa foret  leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals  peroxygens  sulfur derivatives  silicates  zeolites and other products in europe  africa and the middle east 
we are also a percent owner with solutia inc solutia of astaris llc astaris  a north american producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets  including the detergent  food  agricultural and industrial markets 
we account for astaris as an equity investment 
the majority of industrial chemicals sales are to customers engaged in relatively cyclical end markets 
the reorganization of our company we implemented our plan to split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies in through a two step process 
the first step included an initial public offering ipo of percent of fmc technologies  inc technologies  which took place in the second quarter of technologies consists of our former energy systems and food and transportation systems business segments 
subsequent to the ipo  technologies made net payments of million to fmc in exchange for the net assets distributed to technologies on june   which we used to retire short term and long term debt 
the second step  the distribution of our remaining percent ownership in technologies the spin off occurred on december  total net assets distributed on december  were million 
we believe that the spin off of technologies has allowed us to focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation  increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses 
in an effort to align our business with our future growth plans  we took various strategic measures in  and  including the restructuring of businesses  reduction of staff  plant shut downs  plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets 
we believe these steps have increased our financial flexibility  particularly as operating conditions change 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have described our accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have reviewed these accounting policies  identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical 
these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current conditions and other reasonable factors 
environmental we provide for environmental related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate has been used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other  the lower end of the range has been used 
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa  or similar government agencies  are generally accrued no later than when a rod  or equivalent  is issued  or upon completion of a ri fs that is accepted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies 
estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management  as well as by financial and legal management and  if necessary  adjusted as additional information becomes available 
the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination  required remediation methods  and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 
our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances 
such costs principally include  among other items  ri fs  site remediation  costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan  fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort  and future monitoring costs 
estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies  specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income  net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties 
such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves  we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible 
we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated  as well as the status of our claims against such parties 
although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty  the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site by site basis 
our liability includes management s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties 
we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects 
we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies  us government agencies and other third parties  of million and million  respectively  at december  and these recoveries are recorded as an offset to environmental liabilities  continuing and discontinued 
cash recoveries for the years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december  we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as million 
we recorded total environmental provisions related to both operating and discontinued sites of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
impairments and valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and long term investments  goodwill and intangible assets 
we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets  which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable 
the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices  volumes  costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 
we recognized million in asset impairments in related to our industrial chemicals segment 
no such impairments were recognized in either or we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets based on estimated discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates  discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period 
we performed this test in and determined that no impairment charge was required 
total goodwill as of december  and was million and million  respectively and is related to our specialty chemicals segment 
the change in goodwill is due to the effects of currency exchange 
depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset 
estimated useful lives are based on historical useful life trends as well as common industry practice 
useful lives are as follows years land improvements  to years buildings depending on location and use  to years machinery and equipment depending on type and use 
depreciation expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees 
the costs or benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions  including interest discount rates  healthcare cost trend rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees 
the costs or benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions  such as average retirement age  mortality  employee turnover  and plan participation 
to the extent our plans actual experience  as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics  differs from these assumptions  the costs and obligations for providing these benefits  as well as the plans funding requirements  could increase or decrease 
when actual results differ from our assumptions  the difference is typically recognized over future periods 
in addition  the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs in future periods 
we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five year period 
we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements 
the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range  high or low  of the actual market value of assets  and is adjusted accordingly 
we recorded million  million and million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of million and million at december  and  respectively  which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders equity 
we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of million and million  respectively  for and in addition  we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of million and million  for and  respectively 
we paid postretirement benefits  net of participant contributions  of million and million for and  respectively 
our estimated cash contributions for include approximately million in nonqualified pension benefits  approximately million in postretirement benefits  and we are considering making voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately million 
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of high quality corporate bonds with particular focus on the moody s investors service  inc moody s aa rated corporate and industrial bond indices towards the end of each respective year 
bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately years 
we selected a discount rate of percent at december  for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a long term  average rate of return to be earned on the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan  we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries  including historical market returns  information on long term real return expectations by asset class  inflation assumptions  and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates 
we also consider the historical performance of our own plan s trust  which has earned a compound annual rate of return of percent over the last years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors 
the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately percent equities us and us and percent fixed income investments 
given an actively managed investment portfolio  the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio  using geometric averaging  and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent  is between nine percent and eleven percent for both us and us equities  and between five percent and seven percent for fixed income investments  which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions 
for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below 
the other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic other postretirement benefit costs noted above do not reflect the effects of the medicare  prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act 
specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the subsidy included in the medicare act is still pending and once issued may require us to change previously reported information 
we have elected to defer the accounting for the effects of the medicare act 
sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 
a one half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent increase in the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs are found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for this allowance  we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income  the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
results of operations  and overview all results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses 
the results of technologies  which was spun off on december   have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  see the reorganization of our company for an overview of our spin off of technologies

see segment results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for  and results of operations compared to in the following discussion  year refers to the year ending december  and prior year refers to the year ending december  all comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted 
revenue for the year ended december  was  million up percent compared with  million in the prior year 
this increase was due to a stronger euro  growth in specialty chemicals sales in the pharmaceutical market and increased agricultural products sales in latin america and europe 
restructuring and other charges gains totaled million million after tax in compared with million million after tax in the before tax gain of million we recorded in was the result of a gain on the sale of an office building in foret  our spanish subsidiary  offset by charges in all segments 
the gain on the building was million  net of related costs  including severance 
severance costs were recorded in industrial chemicals and in both our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments 
total severance charges  including amounts recorded at foret  were million and related to approximately people most of whom separated from fmc in late the remaining charges in the year included non cash charges totaling million primarily for the abandonment of an asset in the specialty chemicals segment  offset by the reversal of certain workforce related and facility shutdown reserves in corporate as shown in the table in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k resulting from our ability to meet certain obligations on more favorable terms than expected when the reserves were established 
the remaining other charges of million  were related to environmental costs at operating sites  largely in our industrial chemicals segment 
in  restructuring and other charges of million  before tax  consisted of charges related to each of our segments 
the details  by segment  are discussed below 
in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in million of restructuring charges 
included in this amount was a million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill  west virginia 
we also mothballed our granger facility  in green river  wyoming resulting in a million restructuring charge 
the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance  all of which occurred in in addition we recorded a million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals business  alkali  peroxygens and at foret 
there were severances related to these restructurings  all of which occurred in in agricultural products we incurred million of restructuring charges in of which million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy see segment results compared to 
a million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe  which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets 
of the severances related to these restructurings occurred in we recorded million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer  both domestically and internationally 
the majority of these costs resulted from the severance of people  which occurred in the first half of reorganization costs of million and other charges of million were also recorded in these charges are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
also  of the million of restructuring charges recorded in million was spent in equity in earnings loss of affiliates was a loss of million in versus earnings of million in the loss in included charges totaling million related to the previously announced restructuring program at astaris  llp astaris our joint venture 
weaker affiliate earnings were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract  which had a prior year pre tax benefit of approximately million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for further details 
interest expense  net increased by percent to million in compared to million in reflecting higher interest costs in from our refinancing in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for further details on our refinancing and related amendment 
provisions benefit for income taxes were a benefit of million in compared with a provision of million for reflecting tax rates of and  respectively 
the tax rate in was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically 
in addition  dividends received from our foreign operations and a change in the valuation allowance  further contributed to the change in the provision benefit for income taxes from to in  the tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of depletion and differing foreign tax rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for further details 
discontinued operations 
we recorded after tax charges of million and million in and  respectively  for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
see discontinued operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further details 
net income decreased to million in compared with million in reflecting increased interest expense  net  and lower earnings from our industrial chemicals segment somewhat offset by higher earnings in our other segments 
in addition  net income for included restructuring and other charges gains  astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations totaling million after tax or per share on a diluted basis 
as noted in the table under overview above  these charges related primarily to restructuring programs  particularly at our astaris affiliate  reported in equity in earnings loss of affiliates  but also included a gain on the sale of an office building and an after tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of million 
prior year net income included after tax restructuring and other charges of million also related to primarily to restructuring in industrial chemicals  and an after tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of million 
we expect net income to improve in compared to mostly through improvement in industrial chemicals particularly due to better performance from astaris as a result of their restructuring efforts  continued growth in specialty chemicals and lower interest expense 
other financial data capital expenditures totaled million in compared with million in the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
corporate expenses increased to million from million in primarily due to higher insurance costs 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses  lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense 
net other income was million higher than the loss of million 
this variance is largely attributable to a lifo adjustment and the impact of foreign currency 
segment results compared to segment operating profit is presented before taxes  asset impairments  restructuring and other charges gains  interest expense  net and other income and expense  net 
information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
agricultural products year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit the increase in sales was driven by growth in all regions  except north america  and was largely achieved in the fourth quarter of the year 
latin america and europe showed the most significant growth as the year closed 
sales in latin america  particularly brazil  were driven by improved market conditions  and higher sales of proprietary herbicides and insecticides used on such crops as cotton and sugar cane 
stronger european sales resulted from a number of factors  including a stronger euro  new approved uses for propriety herbicides referred to as new labels  and our overall efforts to focus on higher value  proprietary products 
these increases more than offset the decrease in north american insecticide sales into the crop protection market due to lower than average pest pressures 
our professional pest control and home and garden business also saw continued growth during because of this regional sales mix  insecticides were essentially flat for the year  while higher sales of herbicides resulted in most of the revenue increase versus for  our agricultural products revenues are made up of percent insecticides and percent herbicides 
the segment earnings improvement was a result of higher sales  improved product mix related to our focus on higher value proprietary products and lower production costs  some of which was related to our outsourcing strategy in some product lines 
also contributing to the improvement was lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
we believe that agricultural products will continue to successfully execute its strategies in  but expect revenue growth to be essentially flat 
this expectation is dependent on normal pest pressures in north america during specialty chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit biopolymer  which generated percent of segment revenues  had sales increases of percent while sales in our lithium business  which represents percent of the segment  increased by more than percent compared with segment sales increases were driven by us and european growth in biopolymer s mcc products in the pharmaceuticals market  where mcc is used as a binder and disintegrant in tablets 
these increases were partially offset by lower biopolymer sales in our food business  largely as a result of lower demand in the nutritional beverage market 
also contributing were strong lithium sales in the pharmaceutical synthesis market and in the energy storage market from military demand for rechargeable batteries 
in addition  the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  primarily the euro  further contributed to the increase in revenue 
segment earnings increased due to higher sales  favorable foreign currency translation  improved productivity and sales mix 
in  responding to changes in the food business  biopolymer took actions to reduce costs within the business and exited certain end markets 
for  we expect continued improvements in operating profit and middle single digit growth in sales 
industrial chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit industrial chemicals sales increased due almost entirely to foret  our european industrial chemicals business  where favorable currency translation and higher peroxygen selling prices resulted in a percent increase in sales compared with european prices for peroxygens were driven by higher capacity utilization levels coupled with strong demand 
the increased sales at foret were partially offset by decreased revenues in our largely north american based alkali and peroxygens hydrogen peroxides and active oxidants businesses  where sales in decreased percent and percent  respectively  compared with the prior year 
the decrease in alkali was largely a result of lower export prices for soda ash  alkali s primary product  due in part to recent capacity additions in china 
our international sales of soda ash are through the ansac  a foreign sales corporation 
despite successful implementation of some selling price increases  peroxygen sales decreased due to weaker north american hydrogen peroxide volumes to the pulp market 
for  our industrial chemicals segment revenue is made up of percent alkali  percent foret and percent peroxygens 
lower segment earnings in were largely the result of significantly lower affiliate earnings from astaris and lower sales in our alkali and domestic peroxygen businesses 
weaker affiliate earnings from astaris were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract  which had a prior year pre tax benefit of approximately million  and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 
in  astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance 
the restructuring  which includes the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate stpp market  is expected to reduce fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and result in improvement in the venture s position in food and technical phosphates 
the restructuring is expected to be completed over the next six months and will include four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three astaris sites 
our portion of astaris restructuring charges  which totaled million  before tax  were recorded in equity in earnings loss of affiliates 
results of operations compared to revenue for the year ended december  was  million compared to  million in  down percent 
lower revenue in compared to was principally attributable to lower revenue in our industrial chemicals and agricultural products segments 
our industrial chemicals segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions 
also affecting revenue were decreased agricultural products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in asia 
asset impairments 
there were no asset impairments in asset impairments totaled million million after tax in based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets  we recorded asset impairment charges in our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals segments in industrial chemicals recorded impairment charges of million of which million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while million was for the impairments in our us based phosphorus chemicals business 
a weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of we subsequently exited this business in our us based phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our percent interest in astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus business  which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former astaris elemental phosphorus plant in pocatello  idaho 
based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to our us based phosphorus business in the second quarter of the components of asset impairments related to this business include a million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a resource conservation and recovery act rcra consent decree the consent decree at the pocatello  idaho facility  a further million of other non environmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a million impairment charge for our investment in astaris 
driving these charges were a decline in market conditions  the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second ppa plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the shoshone bannock tribes the tribal fund resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the consent decree  which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at pocatello 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our specialty chemicals segment s lithium operations in argentina 
we established this operation  which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities  approximately six years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains 
the entry of a south american manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues 
in addition  market conditions continued to be unfavorable 
as a result  our lithium assets in argentina became impaired  as the total capital invested was not expected to be recovered 
restructuring and other charges totaled million million after tax in compared to million million after tax in in  restructuring and other charges of million  before tax  consisted of charges related to each of our segments 
the details  by segment  are discussed below 
in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in million of restructuring charges 
included in this amount was a million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill  west virginia 
we also mothballed our granger facility  in green river  wyoming resulting in a million restructuring charge 
the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance  all of which occurred in in addition we recorded a million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals business  alkali  peroxygens and at foret 
there were severances related to these restructurings  all of which occurred in in agricultural products we incurred million of restructuring charges in  of which million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy see segment results compared to 
a million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe  which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets 
of the severances related to these restructurings occurred in we recorded million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer  both domestically and internationally 
the majority of these costs resulted in the severance of people 
these severances occurred in reorganization costs of million and other charges of million were also recorded in the period 
these charges are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
also  of the million of restructuring charges recorded in  million was spent in in a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of million  detailed as follows gross recoveries net in millions us phosphorus chemicals business consent decree obligation financing commitments to astaris tribal fund other phosphorus restructuring pocatello shutdown shutdown activities remediation fmc s share of astaris shutdown obligations total us phosphorus chemicals business workforce related facility shutdown fmc s reorganization total restructuring and other charges partial reversal of consent decree obligations 
commitment from astaris related to shutdown and remediation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
industrial chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of million in of which million was for restructuring at several sites  including million for the mothballing of our granger  wyoming soda ash facility  and million was for our us based phosphorus business 
there were severances from the restructuring of industrial chemicals  the majority of which occurred in  with the remainder occurring in in connection with the impairment of our us based phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of we recorded other charges for a million reserve for further required consent decree spending at the pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams  million for financing obligations to the astaris joint venture keepwell payments and a million payment to the tribal fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at pocatello 
subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of  the astaris joint venture announced its plans  in october  to cease production at the pocatello  idaho elemental phosphorus facility in december this decision reflected the shift in astaris sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa  and also reflected the availability of low cost alternative feedstock materials  projected higher future environmental compliance costs at pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the consent decree 
in connection with the decision to shut down pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of we spent million and million of these reserves in and  respectively  with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next to years as we manage the site s decommissioning and environmental issues 
these charges included reserves for decontamination  demolition  and other shut down costs of million  environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of million and our percent share of costs recorded by astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown  or million 
offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of for required consent decree spending at the pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending 
we also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from astaris to pay us million over the next years  reflecting the joint venture s obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site 
we received million from astaris in related to this commitment 
also included in the million of restructuring and other charges related to the us based phosphorus business was a charge of million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of pocatello 
included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at pocatello 
the decision to shut down pocatello was consistent with astaris plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa 
high energy  operating and environmental costs of producing elemental phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of ppa 
the decision to shut down pocatello in the fourth quarter of has allowed us to avoid spending of million for the remaining capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any start up costs for this plant  which could have been significant 
further  there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could escalate in future years and add further costs 
in addition  estimated future costs at astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at pocatello in at an estimated cost of million 
in we recorded million of severance and other costs related to our agricultural products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our r d resources to our core strength in insecticides 
the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in these charges have resulted in savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs 
the annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately million 
there were severances related to these charges  the majority of which occurred in of the remaining restructuring and other charges of million  approximately million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin off of technologies with remaining charges of million related to restructuring in specialty chemicals 
the majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in and in the first half of the benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate reorganization and spin off are not subject to reasonable estimation 
the benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company 
there were approximately severances related to these charges  the majority occurring in net interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our refinancing 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in compared to a benefit of million in resulting in effective tax rates of percent and percent  respectively 
the tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in the differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory us federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates  depletion  the impairment of certain assets  foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes 
discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax in for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
see environmental obligations below and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further details 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax in included in this amount are earnings of technologies  including interest expense of million  which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board statement no 
apb and later relevant accounting guidance  costs related to the spin off and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of technologies from fmc 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 
net income loss 
we recorded net income of million in compared to a net loss of million for this variance reflects million of asset impairments and million of restructuring and other charges recorded in net income in compared to  excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges  was lower due to lower sales in agricultural products and industrial chemicals  somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring activities 
other financial data capital expenditures totaled million in compared to million in lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential value creating projects 
also reducing capital expenditures was the lack of spending related to environmental assets at pocatello 
the need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of with the shutdown of pocatello 
the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
corporate expenses were million in and million in corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense 
net other loss for the year was million compared to a net other loss of million in this variance is largely attributable to a lifo reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses 
segment results compared to agricultural products year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit herbicide sales decreased to million in compared to million in mainly due to a planned reduction in sulfentrazone sales  as we shifted our focus from soybeans to higher value crops  and poor weather conditions in north america 
insecticide sales were down slightly at million in compared to million in mostly due to weaker insecticide demand in asia from drought conditions in australia and channel inventory reductions  somewhat offset by the development of new labels and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in north america 
a stronger demand and new applications in our non agricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in lower herbicide sales and the absence of a million profit protection payment from ei du pont de nemours and company dupont were more than offset by lower selling  administrative and research costs 
in  we entered into an exclusive agreement with dupont to provide them sulfentrazone in north america for use in soybeans 
however  the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in therefore  dupont no longer has the exclusive rights to the product in north america 
earnings also reflected agricultural products continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and realignment of our r d resources to our core strengths in insecticides 
related to these refocusing efforts were restructuring charges in both and in we recorded million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in europe 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops 
restructuring charges are not included in the results of our business segments 
see restructuring and other charges under results of operations compared to for further details 
specialty chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit biopolymer revenue increased to million from million in reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose  for its use in binders  and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the food ingredients market 
partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients 
in lithium  revenue performance was million in compared to million in a stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of lithium salts to japan  due to a weaker economy  and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred in the fourth quarter of higher earnings can be attributed to higher sales from overall biopolymer growth  a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium  due largely to the devaluation of the argentine peso  and the absence of a million million after tax charge from the required change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill 
specialty chemicals goodwill was the direct result of biopolymer s acquisition of pronova biopolymer as 
lithium s earnings were also favorably impacted by higher butyllithium sales 
in addition  the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium  discussed above  delivered a high margin sale in that was not repeated in during  our biopolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial markets it serves  principally with its alginate product line 
as a result  in we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs 
we believe that this action will further focus biopolymer s commercial efforts on core  high value markets  including pharmaceutical formulation  food ingredients and personal care 
industrial chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit alkali revenue decreased to million in from million in due to lower overall volumes  lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter sale of our sodium cyanide business 
a portion of the decline in soda ash revenues was attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash  which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they did in the first quarter of furthermore  we experienced lower international sales volumes through ansac 
foret saw a decrease in revenue to million in compared to million in  reflecting lower phosphate sales  due in part to the loss of a major european detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines 
somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro 
peroxygens revenue decreased to million in from million in due to generally lower selling prices and lower persulfate volumes  reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market 
increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in non pulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of  somewhat offset lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes 
overall earnings levels of million in compared to in the prior year 
relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs  significant cost savings from our and restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at pocatello 
reacting to market weakness in industrial chemicals in we recorded restructuring charges of million to improve our cost position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our granger caustic facility and spring hill  west virginia hydrogen peroxide facility 
during we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure our us based phosphorus chemicals business 
total charges for included an impairment charge of million and restructuring and other charges of million 
segment earnings do not include these charges 
asset impairments and restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results 
see asset impairments and restructuring and other charges above and notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the restructuring of our us based phosphorus chemicals business in late has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus 
our us based phosphorus chemicals business s cost position has improved as its ppa sourcing has increased 
the shutdown of pocatello also allowed fmc to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in and avoid significant start up and certain on going operating costs for environmental compliance issues at the site 
the restructuring activities in should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at spring hill 
lower joint venture earnings at astaris and lower volumes and price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities 
lower earnings from astaris were due to a percent decrease in sales to million in from million in the prior year 
a decreased benefit from the former power resale contract with idaho power and higher than expected startup costs at astaris ppa plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs 
the total resale power benefit to astaris in was approximately million compared to approximately million in this benefit did not continue in recently adopted accounting standards in december the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

estimates of environmental spending are included in liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources during  we paid million  including a premium of million  plus accrued interest  to redeem all of the outstanding percent senior notes due september and all of the percent series b medium term notes due december the redemption of the notes was largely funded from restricted cash  which was million and million at december  and  respectively 
restricted cash shown on the consolidated balance sheets was set aside as a part of the financing transactions discussed below to provide substantial cash for collateral assuring the payment of certain self insurance obligations  environmental remediation activities  future business commitments  cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variable rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds  and cash to redeem long term debt maturing before december  among other restrictions  our credit facilities which are described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements contain financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt  interest coverage measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings  consolidated net worth and capital spending 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  and december in october  the astaris affiliate began implementation of a restructuring plan and in connection with this plan  we expect to make additional payments recorded as capital contributions to astaris of approximately million in and to defer until september a total of approximately million of payments anticipated from astaris 
in december  to accommodate the financial effects on us of the astaris restructuring plan  we were successful in achieving favorable amendments in our credit facilities 
among these amendments were favorable changes in the maximum leverage covenant defined as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and the maintenance of net worth covenant 
along with the favorable covenant amendments  we obtained the agreement of the lenders under our credit facilities to reduce the applicable margin under the term loan facility by percent per annum 
we expect net interest expense in to be approximately million below net interest expense in primarily from lower rates for borrowings under the term loan facility  lower outstanding total debt  and lower average cash balances 
under our credit facilities we had term loan facility borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million revolving credit facility had no outstanding borrowings at december  letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled million at december   which together with the lack of outstanding borrowings  resulted in million of remaining availability 
there were no outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  cash and cash equivalents  excluding restricted cash  at december  compared to december  were million and million  respectively 
the majority of cash and cash equivalents at december   was held by our foreign subsidiaries

short term debt  which consists primarily of foreign borrowings  decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the million decrease in total long term debt at december  from december  was largely the result of the redemption and repayment of our percent senior notes due september and percent series b medium term notes due december in  we paid million  including a premium of million  to redeem the entire outstanding balance of our percent senior notes  plus accrued interest 
in december  we paid million plus accrued interest to redeem at par all of the outstanding percent series b medium term notes 
cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for and cash required by operating activities of million in  primarily reflecting improved working capital management 
also contributing to higher cash provided by operating activities during is lower restructuring spending of million compared to million in and million in included in our operating cash activities in is million for spending on restructuring and other activities  including million for the shutdown of pocatello 
in the spending against restructuring reserves related to the pocatello shutdown was million 
spending against restructuring reserves related to the pocatello shutdown is expected to be approximately million in and is then expected to drop significantly in through its completion 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased significantly in compared to reflecting lower business activity  including lower inventory  in than in also in  cash provided by operating activities improved as a result of collections of accounts receivable especially within agricultural products  particularly in latin america 
because we are a global company with significant investment in the euro zone  the increase in the euro versus the us dollar had a significant effect on the amounts of our operating assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheets 
for better comparability  we exclude this effect in the section of the statement of cash flows entitled change in operating assets and liabilities 
cash required by discontinued operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses 
discontinued environmental spending was million in compared to million in and million in also contributing to the decline in was the absence of certain spending included in related to the spin off of technologies 
in the first quarter of we made an million payment for the settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business 
cash required by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in reflects an increase in financing commitments to astaris and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in compared to cash contributions to astaris were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a planned reduction in capital spending in compared to contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities in additionally  included approximately million for spending on environmental remediation assets at pocatello 
pocatello was shut down in the fourth quarter of  which curtailed this spending 
cash required by financing activities for was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for and million in in  we paid million  including a premium of million  to redeem the entire outstanding balance of our percent senior notes due september  plus accrued interest  and to redeem at par all of the outstanding percent series b medium term notes 
the redemption of these notes was funded with million of restricted cash 
also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to was the completion of an equity offering in the second quarter of resulting in net proceeds of million  which was not repeated in cash provided by financing activities for of million decreased by million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in our financing activities included a net increase in long term debt of million from net proceeds of our refinancing of million

in  we also made payments of million to redeem all outstanding percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures 
financing sources included million  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of million shares of common stock in the second quarter of  which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former million revolving credit facility  which was terminated upon the completion of our refinancing in october our financing activities included million from the ipo of technologies  net of contributions to technologies to support their operating cash needs 
financing transactions during  we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned business operations by completing a series of financing transactions 
in june  we issued million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of million to reduce amounts borrowed under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
following this offering  moody s lowered its rating of our long term debt from baa to ba moody s rating of baa is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty long term debt ratings 
moody s also lowered its rating of our short term debt from p to np  the fourth level from the top of its five level short term debt ratings scale 
subsequent to these actions we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
in october  we completed a significant refinancing in which we issued million aggregate principal amount of percent senior secured notes due simultaneously  we entered into a new million senior secured credit agreement  which provided for a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility  and obtained a million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility 
further details on the refinancing are found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
commitments and other potential liquidity needs our cash needs for include operating cash requirements  capital expenditures  scheduled maturities of long term debt  keepwell payments supporting astaris as described below  environmental spending  and restructuring spending 
we plan to meet our liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our million committed revolving credit facility 
in connection with the finalization of astaris external financing arrangements during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement with astaris lenders under which we agreed to make payments keepwell payments sufficient to make up one half of the shortfall in astaris earnings below certain levels 
solutia  which owns the other percent of astaris  provided a parallel agreement under which it makes up the other half of any shortfall 
astaris earnings did not meet the agreed levels for  and  and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for we made keepwell payments of million under this arrangement in compared to keepwell payments of million in and million in we expect our total keepwell payments for depending on the financial performance of astaris to be approximately million 
astaris credit facility and our agreement under which we make keepwell payments incorporate financial covenants contained in our principal credit facility  and astaris credit facility contains customary default provisions related to our financial condition  results  and solvency 
in the fourth quarter of  astaris lenders agreed to accept a bank letter of credit furnished on behalf of solutia in the amount of million in exchange for a release of a security interest held by the lenders in certain of solutia s assets and removal of solutia s financial covenants and solvency as grounds for default under astaris credit facility 
at december   astaris credit facility obligations  which fmc s and solutia s keepwell payments are intended to support  included outstanding borrowings of million and letters of credit of million  compared to million of outstanding borrowings and million of letters of credit at december  we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers  principally in brazil  for their seasonal borrowing 
a significant portion of the customers obligations to repay us for any amounts paid under the guarantees is secured by liens on their crops 
past losses under this program have been minimal 
amounts recorded as guarantees of vendor financing for december  and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  we also provided guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural product customers in brazil to support their importation of third party agricultural products 
these guarantees totaled million at december  on june   we acquired the assets of tg soda ash  inc from elf atochem north america  inc elf atochem for approximately million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between and on december   we made the required contingent payment in the amount of million  subject to a day review period 
we do not expect this review to result in any additional material payments 
projected spending also includes approximately million of environmental remediation spending  of which approximately million relates to pocatello and million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites 
this spending does not include expected spending of approximately million and million in and  respectively  on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities 
also  we expect to spend in the range of approximately million to million annually in and in for environmental compliance costs  which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves 
other commitments that could affect our liquidity include the following we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of certain obligations under several contracts  debt instruments  and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
as of december   these guaranteed obligations totaled million compared to million at december  at december  and  there was million principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by million in bank letters of credit  which are fully collateralized with cash  which is a component of restricted cash as shown on the consolidated balance sheets of this form k 
we provide parent company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 
the outstanding amounts of guaranteed debt included in short term debt on our consolidated balance sheets of this form k were million and million  respectively  at december  and our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year contractual commitments beyond total in millions short term debt long term debt maturities lease obligations forward energy and foreign exchange contracts astaris keepwells total before discounts 
before recoveries 
astaris keepwell payments are based on our current estimate of keepwell payments likely to be paid in dividends on november   our board of directors approved the spin off of the remaining percent of technologies making it an independent publicly traded company 
the spin off qualified as a tax free distribution to us stockholders 
stockholders of record as of december  received approximately shares of common stock of the new company for every share of our stock 
fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on december  we paid no cash dividends in or and we do not expect to pay dividends in we paid no cash dividends in other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in currency  interest and exchange rates 
to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 
we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using third party software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date 
we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 
at december  our net financial instrument position of interest rate swaps and currency and energy hedges was a net asset of million compared to a net liability of million at december  the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized gains in our energy hedges 
commodity price risk energy costs are approximately percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal  electricity and natural gas 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas 
to analyze the effect of changing energy prices  we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december  and december  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of million at december  and a decrease of million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at december  a percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of million in the net asset position into a net liability position at december  at december  a percent decrease in energy market prices would have resulted in an increase of million in the net liability position 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro  the euro versus the norwegian krone  the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real 
foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates  we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december  and december   with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in an increase of million and million in the net liability position at december  and  respectively 
a percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of million and million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in the agreements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
in the first quarter of  we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of million 
these swaps  in which we exchange net amounts based on making payments derived from a floating rate index and receiving payments on a fixed rate basis  are used to hedge our percent senior secured notes due interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under sfas no 
are accounted for as fair value hedges 
the net position of these interest rate swap agreements is not material at december  all existing fair value hedges are percent effective 
as a result  there is no effect on earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 
our debt portfolio  including interest rate swap agreements  at december  is composed of percent fixed rate debt and percent variable rate debt compared to percent fixed rate debt and percent variable rate debt at december  the variable rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of bank borrowings  variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable rate debt portfolio in different ways 
based on the variable rate debt  including interest rate swap agreements  in our debt portfolio at december  and  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates in and would increase or decrease net income by million and million  respectively
