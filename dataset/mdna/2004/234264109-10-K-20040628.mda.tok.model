part i 
item business overview daktronics  inc the company is a leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems  marketing services  digital messaging solutions and related software and services for sports  business and transportation applications 
its focus is on supporting customers with superior products and services that provide dynamic  reliable and often unique visual communication solutions 
it offers a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large  multi million dollar  video display systems as well as related control systems  timing systems and professional services 
it is recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems that display real time data  graphics  animation and video 
services provided by the company include project management  on site installation and event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance and display rentals 
the company invests a significant portion of its research and development resources into monochrome and full color led light emitting diode based display systems and has done so over the past several years 
the company continues to invest in technology to develop new products and enhancements for a wide variety of existing scoreboard and display products and to find new opportunities for existing products 
every day  viewers all over the world count on daktronics scoreboards  displays and related products for information and entertainment 
the company sells display systems ranging from small scoreboards under  to large complex display systems priced in excess of million 
generally  the company s product sales are either custom products with contract sizes ranging from approximately  to million  or standard catalog scoreboards or displays which account for approximately of the company s total annual revenues 
its custom products are typically customized in terms of size  configuration and installation type but are built utilizing standard physical and technology platforms 
the company s sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders such as display systems for facilities where professional and major college sports events take place and large commercial systems 
the seasonality of the sports market has also played a part in the company s sales and profit fluctuations 
as a result  sales and net income in the first and second quarters of a fiscal year tend to be generally higher than the third quarter of a fiscal year  followed by higher levels in the fourth quarter  leading into the first quarter of the following year 
this seasonality is caused by sales related to facilities for football and other fall sports in the summer and early fall  followed by sales generally related to facilities for basketball and hockey in the fall  and finally facilities for baseball and other spring and summer sports in the early to late spring 
this seasonal effect is generally compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during the third quarter 
the effects of seasonality not related to holidays are generally not found in the company s commercial and transportation markets  although the impact of large orders in those markets can cause significant fluctuations in sales and profits 
approximately two thirds of the company s sales are in the sports markets  with the remaining split between business  transportation and services 
the company considers itself to be operating in a single industry segment  as explained in the notes to the financial statements included in this report 
the company s gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller  standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins 
although the company follows the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for these larger orders  the company nevertheless has experienced fluctuations in operating results and expects that its future results of operations may be subject to similar fluctuations 
industry the company is an established leader in large electronic display systems 
in its early years through the mid s  the industry predominately focused on incandescent and reflective technologies and controllers 
these technologies were the key product categories for the company during this same time period 
during the mid s  a technological breakthrough in display technology occurred which contributed significantly to the growth and position of the company as a world leader in its markets the development of a blue light emitting diode that was visible outdoors and that could be manufactured in large quantities 
this provided the basis for significant growth in the industry and for the company 
with this development  the company entered the large screen video display business 
before this development  large screen video displays were primarily made of small cathode ray tubes crt that were limited in size and generally provided by the same companies that were in the television set business 
the company leveraged its knowledge of the display business with the availability of high quality red  blue and green light emitting diodes to broaden its scope and provide not only text and graphics based electronic displays but also large video displays for both outdoor and indoor usage 
it also converted most of its incandescent and reflective technologies to lower cost  more efficient  led based technology 
in fiscal years and  it added lcds liquid crystal displays and related software as part of an integrated solution to supplement led display applications and as stand alone applications 
in general  the industry is characterized by market participants that provide limited product offerings as compared to the company 
for example  most manufacturers of large electronic displays that are used to show alphanumeric data and graphics do not manufacture large video displays and scoreboards 
conversely  most large video display manufacturers do not manufacture scoreboards and text or graphics displays 
in addition  most of the suppliers across all the product lines do not possess the level of integration  software solutions and professional services the company does 
this places it in a unique position to serve venues that have numerous requirements  such as the typical large sports venue and the more sophisticated commercial and transportation applications 
the company  through the use of its proprietary venus display control software and its v play video server software  also has the unique capability of controlling and managing content on large displays  such as in a large stadium or arena  between the video display functions provided by the large video display and the information and animation display functions provided by computer programmable display and providing seamless integration with standard video equipment and other software applications 
having all these functions integrated into a display system gives the application significant flexibility in managing the information and entertainment spectators receive to an extent not matched by competitors 
company background dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander founded the company in while professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota  in part to utilize the talents of university graduates 
one of the key factors contributing to the growth of the company and its leadership in the industry has been its close relationship with sdsu and other south dakota colleges and universities that provide the company an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
the company produced and sold its first product in a voting display system for the utah legislature 
using some of the technology developed from voting display systems  it expanded its product line to scoreboards in and commercial displays in beginning in the late s  the company integrated computers into display controllers to process information provided by an operator and to formulate the information for presentation on a display 
at that time  the company also began building computer programmable information display systems utilizing standard modules in a variety of configurations 
the use of modular sections for both its smaller and larger display systems allowed the company to offer customers a broad range of both standard and custom products 
innovations like these helped the company obtain a major scoreboard contract for the olympic winter games and several large college installations early in its history 
in the early to mid s  the company continued to enhance its controller and display technology  acquired the glow cube reflective display technology and a manufacturer of printed circuit boards  and installed its first scoreboard in a professional sports facility 
during the s  the company expanded its product lines  increased market share in its existing markets and developed new markets for it products 
for example  it enhanced its starburst multi color incandescent display technology by developing a new lens and reflector design to capture viewer attention and reduce energy consumption 
it developed display control circuitry capable of displaying million possible color combinations at frames per second for starburst displays 
the company utilized this circuitry to develop technology for led video displays 
historically  the company built and enhanced products through its ability to transition technology from one application to another 
this remains a key initiative for the company 
with the advent of full color led display systems and various software applications  the company made significant progress in building market share through quality products and services utilizing its technical expertise to become one of the world s leaders in its markets 
its products are now seen in many professional sports complexes  including fully integrated systems at the toyota center in houston  texas  jacobs field in cleveland  ohio  lambeau field in green bay  wisconsin  soldier field in chicago  illinois  several major colleges  universities and other amateur facilities and events  including the   and olympic games  many commercial installations  including multi million dollar displays in times square  new york  las vegas  nevada  and branson  missouri  small message signs for national retailers and fast food chains  and transportation display systems  such as over the road message displays for many state and federal agencies  including departments of transportation in virginia  new jersey  new york  rhode island  california  washington  delaware  illinois  pennsylvania  mexico  canada and new zealand 
over the past few years  the company has achieved significant recognition and awards for its products and financial performance 
in  the company s chairman  dr 
aelred kurtenbach  was awarded the national ernst young entrepreneur of the year award for the manufacturing category 
the company has also been named  on numerous occasions  as the south dakota business of the year by the south dakota chamber of commerce and industry 
daktronics was ranked nd and th on forbes list of the best small companies in america in and  and rd and th in and on the list of america s fastest growing small companies by fortune small business magazine 
it was also ranked th and th on the list of the best small companies in and by business week magazine and th  th and th on the list of the fastest growing tech companies by business in   and according to a recent industry report  the company has the largest share of the worldwide market for led video displays and is considered the number one led text display supplier in the world 
products the company offers its customers a wide range of electronic display solutions 
products within each product family use displays and controllers that are built with many of the same components to reduce the cost of production  improve delivery time and provide flexibility for standard and custom installations 
the use of standard components also enhances the reliability and serviceability of the display systems 
for example  the basketball scoreboard family includes products that use many of the same components and range from a small  single faced scoreboard to a large  four sided display with player statistics 
the sizes of displays can vary significantly depending on the needs of the customer  taking into account such things as viewing angles and spectator distances 
the two principal components of most of the company s systems are the display and the display controller 
the display controller uses computer hardware and software to process the information provided from the operator and other integrated sources and to formulate the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the display 
the display controller controls each of the pixels dots or picture elements that make up the image on the display to present the message or image 
data can be transferred between the display controller and local and or remote displays 
local connections use twisted pair cables  fiber optic cables  infrared links or radio links 
both standard  cellular telephone connections and satellite transmissions are used to connect to remote displays 
within each product family  the company produces both standard and custom displays that vary in complexity  size and resolution 
large  full color video display systems are generally much more complex than standard alternating time and temperature display systems 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  the light source or pixels are spaced farther apart for longer distance viewing 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
the company s display technology has changed significantly since the mid s  when incandescent lamps were the primary display element  to the present  when led and lcd technologies are the primary display elements 
the invention and availability to the company of the blue and green led in the mid s  along with the already available red led  allowed the introduction of full color video displays using leds  as red  green and blue are the primary colors utilized to form all other colors in any video display 
the decreasing costs of lcd components along with the drive for more numerous smaller displays led to the addition of lcd displays 
the availability of improved high brightness and cost effective red and amber leds has made them the preferred display element for large monochrome displays  replacing both incandescent and reflective technologies in most applications 
the cost effectiveness  life and performance of lcds have made them the preferred indoor small display solution 
the company is now offering led based products across its entire product line that for the most part preempt the incandescent lamp and reflective technology products it previously offered 
led technology excels over incandescent technology with superior viewing characteristics  energy efficiency  cost of maintenance and lifetime 
it excels over reflective technology in all the same areas except energy efficiency  as the reflective technology is extremely energy efficient 
the vast majority of displays sold by the company today utilize led technology 
most of the company s display technologies rely on one or more of the company s software products to manage the display 
these software products range from scoring entry consoles to the venus display control software that allows the creation  display and scheduling of dynamic text and basic graphics content on electronic displays  to the venus display control system that controls multi color displays and video boards  providing the ability to create graphics and animation as well as interfacing with third party software for content  and to the v net control software used to display targeted messages to specific audiences 
complementary software  such as the company s dakstats and interfacing software  is also available and fully integrated into the control software 
product families and technologies the company s product offering is comprised of four major product families 
each product family incorporates the basic display and controller technology tailored to a specific market application 
as a result  there is significant sharing of technology among the product families 
the company s engineering resources are organized within a specific product development team assigned to each of the four product families 
each of these design teams operates autonomously in advancing the capabilities and offerings of their respective product families 
the four product families include o sport products  primarily all sport  tuff sport and omnisport scoreboards  controllers and timing systems o video products  primarily prostar and proad displays o business commercial products  primarily galaxy displays o transportation products  primarily vanguard displays sport products 
the sport products family includes a full line of indoor and outdoor scoreboards  timing systems  digit displays  statistics software and other related products 
the indoor products  which are available in led technologies  range from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating message centers and advertising panels 
outdoor scoreboards  which are available in led and incandescent technologies  also range from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to large scoring systems incorporating message centers and advertising panels 
the company expects that sport products sales in the future will continue to focus on led technology due to the lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
substantially all sport products sales are led technology 
since most of the products within the sport products group have significant standardization  the company has been able to make progress on its goal to deliver the highest quality products while maintaining consistent and favorable margins 
the company offers a variety of internally developed controllers complementing its scoreboards and displays  which vary depending on the sport and complexity of the system 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  which is an entry level controller for scoreboards  to the all sport  which is designed for more sophisticated scoring systems allowing for more user defined options 
these controllers can be interfaced with the scoreboards through radio frequencies  fiber optic connections and other means 
the company also offers timing systems for sports events  primarily aquatics and track competitions 
in fiscal year  the company introduced its omnisport timing system 
the system has the capability to not only time and rank the competitors  but also to interface to event management software created by other third parties to facilitate the administration of the sporting event 
finally  the company markets sports statistics and results software under the dakstats trademark to complement the controllers 
the dakstats software allows scorekeepers and statisticians to enter and display sports statistics and other information on scoreboards and other types of displays 
the dakstats baseball software was first used in by the aaa minor league buffalo bisons and has now been installed at several professional sports facilities  including oriole park at camden yards in baltimore  maryland  jacobs field in cleveland  ohio  ameriquest field formerly the ballpark in arlington  texas  and coors field in denver  colorado 
the company has developed proprietary statistics and results software for several other sports such as football  volleyball  basketball  auto racing and skiing 
video products 
the video products family consists primarily of displays comprised of a large number of pixels capable of creating various levels of video  graphics  animation and text and controllers which manage the operation of the display 
the video products group has been the most significant product group for the company in terms of net sales 
video display products are based on red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels or picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for varying the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 
the company offers a wide range of video display products for different applications and budgets 
variables in typical video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch  the brightness of the displays  the number of discrete colors color resolution that the circuitry is able to produce and the viewing angle 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with no maximum to the size of display that can be built 
in general  the more pixels and the more color resolution  the better the video image on the display 
the company s prostar video display systems offer specifications second to none in the industry 
at the high end  the product is capable of producing trillion colors and is available with pixel spacing as low as three millimeters 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
the company s proprietary display control circuitry along with proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures provide uniform colors across the display 
the first prostar video display systems were installed in the fall of since that time  the company has become the world s leading large screen video display product manufacturer 
it has installed hundreds of displays in both indoor and outdoor applications  such as professional  college and university  and municipal and high school sporting facilities 
this technology is also popular in commercial applications  such as times square in new york city  casinos  billboards and other entertainment applications 
currently  the company offers a wide range of pixel spacings  ranging from millimeter to millimeter 
the millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance and the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with maximum viewing distances 
in the late s  the company adapted the technology used in its prostar product line to introduce the proad digital advertising and information display system 
proad technology uses similar red  green and blue led modules configured in different height to width ratios to give arena and stadium facilities the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in various locations in the facility 
this application generally serves as a revenue generation source for facilities through advertising as well as a location to display information such as scoring  statistics and video designed to entertain and inform the spectators 
the company s main controller for video displays is its venus controller  which is built on the windows operating system 
this high end controller provides advanced capability for control of large video displays 
the v play event management software provides facilities with integrated and sophisticated event program management capabilities with integration to video equipment 
it provides instant replays  live action and overlays of information  and it allows for the organization and playback of digital video and audio clips 
the company designs interfaces between its display systems and other computer systems  allowing its scoreboard systems to receive and display information from computers used for statistics  timing or scoring 
these interfaces allow the display controller to send information back to a statistics system or customer computer 
these interface products automatically report continually updated sports scores and information from national wire services 
during fiscal year  the company developed its prorail technology 
this product  combined with the proad system  typically serves as a replacement for the fascia of an upper deck in a stadium or arena  allowing the stadium contractor to save on construction costs 
in addition  it offers ease of access to service the proad displays and in some cases improved site lines for the fans 
in fiscal year  the company introduced its millimeter full color prostar videoplus display technology to address the need for greater resolution 
this technology is capable of producing trillion colors and can run high definition content to provide the sharpest  clearest image in the industry 
during the same fiscal year  it also introduced its v net narrowcasting system  which provides the tools needed to author  schedule  distribute and play focused messages over an existing network  resulting in a dynamic medium that delivers a wide variety of content to entice customers  inform guests and entertain crowds 
business commercial products 
the key product line in the business products family is the galaxy product line  which includes various indoor and outdoor applications intended primarily as text based message displays  including displays with graphics capability 
all of the current product offerings within the business products group utilize led technologies 
galaxy displays  available in both indoor and outdoor models  have become the company s leading product line for commercial applications and are expected to be a key product line for the company s growth in the future 
monochrome and full color galaxy displays are either red  amber or full color with pixel spacing ranging from millimeter to millimeter  depending on size and viewing distance 
they are used primarily as message centers to convey information and advertising to the consumers and the public 
this product line has been the key driver in the company s growth in national accounts using exterior signage applications 
the modular design of the product allows the company to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
within the galaxy line  the company offers various price points for similar sized displays of the same pixel spacing 
other product lines within the business products group include the company s datatime  datatrac  datamaster and infonet displays 
the datatime product line is comprised of digit based characters and is used primarily for displaying information such as time and temperature 
the datamaster product line is also comprised of digit based characters and is used primarily for lottery and parking displays 
the datatrac product lines consist of indoor led displays comprised of discrete characters 
each character is spaced horizontally and vertically from the adjacent character 
this provides the least expensive display per character for display of text messages only 
dakticker displays are used primarily in financial institutions for ticker displays and other financial information 
the infonet product line includes line oriented displays for indoor use that are available as single or multi line units 
all datamaster  datatrac  dakticker and infonet products have a controller in the display that is capable of receiving a downloaded display program and then operating independently to display that program until a new program is downloaded to it 
the majority of the company s business products group s products utilize the company s venus display control software to control the creation of messages and graphic sequences for downloading to the display 
this software is designed to be useable without any special training  and it is applicable to all general advertising or message presentation applications 
the company also provides software that allows oem customers system integrators to write their own software using the venus software developer s kit to communicate to other displays supplied by the company 
several system integrators have implemented the venus protocol into their specific applications  resulting in additional display sales 
transportation products 
the transportation products group includes a full line of electronic displays and controllers marketed under the vanguard product line 
vanguard displays are typically installed to help direct traffic and inform motorists 
the company has also developed a control system for these displays to help manage a network of displays 
both the led based displays and the software are ntcip national transportation communications for its protocol compliant and meet the various requirements imposed by government and other regulatory bodies 
during fiscal year  the company also introduced its vanguard vp model  a portable roadside variable message display 
this display  which runs on batteries and is built on led technology  is generally controlled by remote wireless means 
marketing and sales the company s products have been sold throughout the united states and in many other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and independent resellers 
in the united states and canada  the company utilizes primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and transportation applications 
in the smaller sports venues  primarily high schools and similar facilities  as well as commercial facilities  the company utilizes a combination of direct sales staff and resellers 
the majority of the products sold by resellers are standard or catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
the majority of all models are built to order and quoted for shipment in to days after order acceptance 
the company supports its resellers through national and regional direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and direct sales force support in the field 
the company believes that it can expand market share by expanding its direct sales force  increasing the productivity of existing resellers and adding additional resellers in new geographic areas 
the company s direct sales force is comprised of a network of offices located throughout north america and europe supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as mentioned above  the direct sales staff also sells the entire range of standard products and substantially all the large video display systems for the company 
over the last few years  the company has developed a regional sales and service approach to complement the customer type market sales focus it had been using previously 
this has caused a significant investment in sales infrastructure to encourage more team selling across markets and more efficient use of the company s sales staff 
for example  previously a sales person specializing in colleges and universities tended to overlook opportunities in the commercial market  as those opportunities were covered by another direct sales person 
under the current approach  although the sales personnel retain a focus in a particular market or markets  they are also responsible as a regional team member to uncover opportunities for the other markets and to transition their knowledge into the other markets to help close orders 
when the company targets a potential customer for a display system  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently  engineers  technicians and direct sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and assemble and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
the company also regularly hosts prospective customers at its manufacturing facility to demonstrate product quality and delivery capability 
the company s direct sales staff is also responsible for international sales in their respective markets 
its direct sales staff works primarily through resellers  and during fiscal years  and  approximately   and of the company s net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
international sales fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit or partial payment in advance 
the company believes that in addition to growth that it expects will still occur in the domestic markets  it will also achieve growth in the international markets 
the company believes that much of its marketing and sales success in the past has been based on its ability to create new products and product enhancements for its customers by understanding their needs and opportunities 
it develops this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and various others and through attendance at trade shows  conventions and seminars as well as through a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
the primary markets served by the company  along with types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers sports elementary and secondary schools  colleges and universities  recreation centers  professional sports teams and facilities  olympic games  national and international sports federations  civic arenas and convention centers and motor racing 
commercial retailers  hospitality providers  quick serve restaurants  outdoor advertisers  financial institutions  casinos  pari mutual racing and other businesses 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries and transit authorities 
the company has a large and diverse customer base 
as a result  the loss of a major customer would not have an adverse impact on the company 
professional services the company s keyframe support group provides a variety of services for its customers  including video and animation support  event support  control room design  on site training hardware and software  and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
daktronics sports marketing  a division of the company  provides customers  primarily sports facilities  with a complete display system  funded in part through value added marketing services provided as part of the system 
these marketing services extend beyond the marketing potential of the equipment in the facility to other facility related components 
typically  these services are limited to facilities that do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
customer service and support the company believes that prompt and reliable customer service distinguishes it from its competitors 
the company provides a limited warranty for most of its products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer 
under the limited warranty  the customer returns the failed component to the company for replacement or repair 
the company also provides customer service and support  including help desk access  parts repair and replacement  and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
the company staffs its help desk with experienced technicians who are available at the desk or on call for the extended hours required to support evening and weekend sports events 
a comprehensive database of customers provides the company with immediate access to each customer s equipment and service history 
a repair center is staffed with trained technicians who promptly repair and return components that require service  and it offers a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
the company s modular approach to the design and production of products enhances its ability to provide effective customer service and support 
customers can obtain periodic training and maintenance seminars at the company s principal offices and also contract for on site training and maintenance for certain types of installations  such as high profile sports events 
the company believes that its customer support program is essential to continued market penetration 
to enhance the level of service available to its customers  the company provides maintenance and support services in all of its offices throughout north america and europe and plans to open other service centers in the future 
sales of the company s standard and  to a lesser degree  custom products to small and mid sized sports venues and commercial customers are also made through these offices 
in addition  the company uses a network of authorized service companies in other domestic locations and in a number of other countries to service and maintain its products 
engineering and product development the large screen electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry and  more importantly  remain a leader in creating the innovations and developments 
the company intends to continue its tradition of applying engineering resources throughout its business to help achieve more effective product development  manufacturing  sales and customer support 
it also remains committed to investing approximately of its net sales into research and development 
the company employs engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical design  electronics design  applications engineering  and customer and product support 
unlike some companies  which depend on contract engineering from outside vendors  the company uses in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
the company assigns product managers from its engineering staff to each product or product family to assist its sales staff in training  to implement product improvements and to ensure that each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
its product development personnel also modify existing products and develop new products to comply with rule changes for particular sports 
the company also invests in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
the company s engineering staff consists of the following four product development groups aligned with the primary product families o sport products engineering o video products engineering o business commercial products engineering o transportation products engineering each of these design groups is autonomous to allow it to focus on its product family while at the same time closely tied with the other groups for sharing of ideas and technology 
this organizational structure  plus a concentrated focus on standardization  which reduces the amount of engineering time allocated to one time custom design  positions the company for effective product development in the future 
the company believes its engineering capability and experience are unparalleled among its competitors and its product development capability will continue to be a very important factor in its market position 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately   and  respectively 
manufacturing and technical contracting as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  the company performs most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of its products 
the company also serves as a technical contractor for customers who desire custom hardware design  custom software development  installation or other technical services 
manufacturing operations the company s manufacturing operations include component manufacturing printed circuit boards and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
star circuits  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  manufactures printed circuit boards primarily for the company at its separate production facility located in brookings  south dakota 
the company augments its production capacity with the use of outside subcontractors primarily for metal fabrication and loading printed circuit boards  which provides it with increased capacity 
the company uses a modular approach for manufacturing its displays 
standard product modules are designed and built to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
the company inventories finished goods of a very limited supply of standard products and builds to order most other standard and custom products 
it designs product modules so that a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
certain components used in the company s products are currently available from a limited number of sources 
to reduce its inventories and enhance product quality  the company elects to purchase certain components from a limited number of suppliers who are willing to provide components on an as needed basis 
from time to time  the company enters into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which it agrees to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the course of the contract  which generally do not exceed one year 
in scheduling and manufacturing  production employees work as teams to ensure quality and timely delivery while minimizing excess inventories 
the company s order entry  production and customer service functions are also consolidated through an erp enterprise resource planning system to facilitate communication throughout the entire sales  design  production and delivery process 
technical contracting the company serves as a technical contractor for larger display system installations that require custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of scoreboards and other state of the art display systems for large installations typically involves competitive proposals by the company and its competitors 
as a part of its response to a proposal request  the company may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system 
if requested by a customer or if necessary to help secure a bid  the company will include as a part of its contract proposal the work necessary to prepare the site and install the display system 
in such cases  the company may serve as the general contractor and retain subcontractors 
with each custom order  the company forms a project team to assure that the project is completed to the customer s satisfaction 
key members of a project team include a project manager  sales person  mechanical design team  electronics and software team  manufacturing team  content specialist  installation supervisor and a senior manager 
backlog the company s backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders that the company expects to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of may  and million as of may  because sales agreements and purchase orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by customers with limited or no penalty  the company s backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
while orders for certain products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition in certain markets 
there are a number of established manufacturers of competing products who may have greater market penetration in certain market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  the company may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competitors might also attempt to copy the company s products or product features 
many of the company s competitors compete in only one or a few of the market niches served by the company 
there are generally more competitors in markets that require less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market and the commercial market for time and temperature or message displays used by banks and small retail stores 
as the needs of a customer increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
nevertheless  competition may be intense even within markets that require more complex display systems 
during fiscal year and into  there was a considerable amount of change in competitors in the video display portion of the company s business 
the changes included new competitors  consolidation of competitors and various other changes 
the company believes that although these changes have an impact on the market as a whole  because of its experience and its approach to the market  it can continue to grow and expand its business 
the company competes based on its broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery  and reliable and readily available customer service 
the company also strives to provide cost effective products and solutions for its customers 
contrary to the company s focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  certain companies compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems which  in the company s belief  are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  the company is less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  it must continue to enhance its existing products  introduce new products and product features  and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these regulations may impose greater restrictions on electronic displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a moving display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit the company from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of the company s products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
the company designs and produces these products in accordance with these standards 
the company s printed circuit board manufacturing operations use certain chemical processes that are subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
the company s manufacturing operations must also meet various safety related rules and regulations 
the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations

overview the company designs  manufactures  and sells a wide range of large screen electronic display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
the company focuses its sales and marketing efforts on geographical regions  markets and products 
the primary markets served are the sports  commercial and transportation markets 
the company s net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for professional sports facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales also fluctuate due to other seasonality factors  including the timing of the various sports seasons and the impact of holidays  which primarily impact the company s third quarter 
the company s gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although the company follows the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for larger custom orders  the company nevertheless has experienced fluctuations in operating results and expects that its future results of operations may be subject to similar fluctuations 
the company operates on a to week fiscal year  with fiscal years ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
fiscal years and contained weeks 
fiscal year contained weeks and the first quarter of fiscal year contained weeks as compared to the more typical week year and week quarter 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on the financial results of the company  refer to note of the financial statements of the company  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory and contingencies 
its estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term contracts 
earnings on long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are estimable 
generally  contracts entered into by the company have fixed prices established  and to the extent the actual costs to complete contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when the company revises its estimates 
the company s practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates become known to it 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairments in the customer s ability to pay  the company reviews aging reports  contacts customers in connection with collection efforts and reviews other available information 
as of may   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of approximately million 
warranties 
the company has created a reserve for warranties on its products equal to its estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with its performance under the warranty 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if the company would become aware of an increase in its warranty reserves  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
as of may   the company had a total of approximately million deferred for these costs 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
the company has deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
if the company would become aware of an increase in its estimated costs under these agreements in excess of its deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  the company examines cost trends on the contracts and other information and compares that to the deferred revenue 
as of may   approximately million in additional reserves were provided for 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonable predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  the company estimates market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market  and any necessary charges are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which it occurs 
all other inventory is valued at cost 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in the company s consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended may   may  and april  years ended may  may  april  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year net sales in all three markets of the company increased in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in sports markets was across all components  from smaller institutions  such as high schools and recreation centers  to professional sports facilities 
the most significant area of growth was in the professional sports facilities as a result of a number of large contracts signed by the company during the year and in the prior fiscal year 
although professional sports facilities net sales were up during the year  they are expected to decline in fiscal year from fiscal year the company believes that sales in the sports market increased in fiscal year due primarily to an expanding market as the company s products have become more affordable  additional services offered to customers  such as sports marketing services  and its overall product offerings  which the company believes are the most complete and integrated systems in the marketplace 
in addition  it benefits from its network of sales and service offices located throughout the united states and canada and  beginning in fiscal year  in europe  giving it the ability to serve its customers more effectively 
the company believes that the effects of the economy have a lesser impact on the sports market as compared to its other markets because its products are generally revenue generation tools through advertising for facilities and the sports business in general is a recession resistant business 
finally  during the second half of fiscal year  there were significant changes in the mix of competitors seeking business in the united states sports market  while at the same time  the company aggressively pursued business outside of north america 
overall  the company believes it is still well positioned with respect to its competition 
orders in the sports markets were also up during the year in all areas 
most of the increase in order bookings was concentrated in the professional sports facilities and the smaller sports facilities for substantially similar reasons as described above 
the increase in net sales for the commercial market was the result of an expanding line of products  a growing distribution network and growth in product acceptance  as commercial establishments tend to understand the advantages of electronic displays as an advertising media 
these positive factors are partially offset by the constraints that exist in the marketplace related to obtaining permits to install outdoor electronic displays 
in addition  the company has focused on sales to national accounts  primarily retail organizations and billboard companies 
during the year  sales to this area of the market increased significantly due to increased sales to a limited number of national accounts  and the company believes that this portion of the commercial market will continue to see growth in the future 
the company also believes that sales in the commercial market are expected to continue expanding at rates faster than in other markets  however  growth in this market depends on the state of the economy  which was more favorable in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in orders for the year in this market was due to the same factors affecting net sales 
the increase in sales in the transportation market was due to a number of factors  including the overall product offerings and the company s efforts in previous years to grow and develop its relationships with customers  including departments of transportation and transportation system integrators  resulting in repeat sales 
as a result of current pending legislation in congress related to federal spending on transportation  the company is optimistic that the government will fund significant increases in spending within the intelligent transportation segment of the transportation market  which would benefit the company by providing funds to purchase the company s products 
the increase in orders for the year in this market was due to the same factors affecting sales 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year net sales in all three major markets of the company increased in fiscal year over fiscal year the increases in the sports markets were across all components  from smaller institutions  such as high schools and recreation centers  to professional sports facilities 
the most significant area of growth was in the mid sized institutions  primarily colleges  universities  minor league sports facilities and larger municipal stadiums and arenas 
orders in the sports markets were also up during fiscal year as compared to most of the increase in order bookings were concentrated in the mid sized institutions 
orders related to professional sports facilities were down year over year  however  in the last quarter of fiscal year  the company booked an unusually high level of orders for professional sports facilities which generated net sales in fiscal year the increase in net sales in fiscal year as compared to for the commercial market was the result of an expanding line of products  a growing distribution network and the overall growth in product acceptance  as commercial establishments tend to understand the advantages of electronic displays 
these positive factors were partially offset by declining economic conditions and the constraints that exist in the marketplace related to the obtaining of permits to install electronic displays 
in addition  the company had focused on sales to national accounts  primarily national retail type organizations and billboard companies 
during the year  sales to this area of the market began to decline 
the increase in orders for the year in this market was due to the same factors affecting net sales 
the increase in net sales in fiscal year as compared to in the transportation market was due to a number of factors  including the overall product offerings and the company s efforts in previous years to grow and develop its relationships with customers  including departments of transportation and transportation system integrators  resulting in repeat sales 
the increase in the transportation market was partially offset by a decline in sales in the aviation portion of the market  which is primarily the result of the state of that business overall but is also due to the inclusion in fiscal year of a single large order for a major airline 
no similar order in that portion of the transportation market existed in fiscal year the increase in orders for the year in this market was also due to the same factors affecting net sales 
the company s backlog at the end of fiscal year was approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal year the growth in the backlog as a percent of fiscal year backlog was the highest in the commercial market due to a couple of larger orders booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal year backlog also increased over fiscal year in the transportation market  but was down in sports 
the decline in sports was due to the number of large projects the company was involved in with the national football league during fiscal year that did not exist at the end of fiscal year backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the effects of large orders  and significant variations can be expected as explained previously herein 
in addition  the company s backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also as explained previously 
the company occasionally sells products in exchange for advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display 
these sales represented less than of net sales for each of fiscal year  and the gross profit margin on these net sales has historically been comparable to or higher than the gross profit margin on other net sales of similar sized installations 
gross profit fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above and an improvement in the gross profit as a percent of net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margins as a percent of net sales was due to a number of factors  including lower raw materials costs  the benefits of signing orders in advance of raw material price declines that were not foreseen at the time of booking the orders  improvements in on site project costs as compared to estimates  improvements in the expected margin at contract signing  improved overhead absorption in manufacturing  and an improved mix between higher margin standard products and large contracts 
these improvements were offset by higher freight costs due to the growth in standard product orders and inventory losses due to more conservative inventory management and obsolescence 
the company continues to strive towards higher gross margins as a percent of net sales  although depending on the actual mix and level of futures sales  margin percentages may not increase and are likely to decrease from the level of fiscal year however  as a result of various factors  the actual margin could vary significantly 
the company believes that the gross margin percent in fiscal year will be higher than in fiscal year but less than in fiscal year fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above and an improvement in the gross profit as a percent of net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margins as a percent of net sales was due to a number of factors  including improvements in raw materials costs  an overall improvement in expected margins at contract signing in the sports and commercial markets  and improved overhead absorption due to production volumes and benefits realized from cost reductions in fiscal year the company experienced a decline in the gross margin percentage in the professional sports facilities portion of the sports markets during fiscal year due primarily to the competitive nature of the business in that area 
it also experienced declines in gross margin percentages in its transportation markets 
the increases in gross margin percentages in fiscal year as compared to were offset partially by negative impacts of costs incurred as the company reduced inventory levels  incurring higher costs related to excess and obsolete inventory 
operating expenses fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative and product design and development costs  increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year for fiscal year  all components of operating expenses were affected as a result of the year containing weeks as opposed to the weeks included in fiscal years and in addition  during the fiscal year ended may   the company incurred higher profit sharing plan contributions than in fiscal year  which affected all areas 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  operating expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year overall operating costs were impacted by higher costs of insurance  personnel costs and employee benefit costs 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment expenses  facilities related costs for sales and service offices  and expenditures for marketing efforts  including the costs of collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expense dollars resulted from higher levels of personnel and related infrastructure  higher travel and entertainment costs related to international business and regional support initiatives  greater depreciation costs related to demonstration equipment and finally higher marketing and sales literature costs focused primarily on the larger sports venues as the business became more competitive 
these increases were offset by lower bad debt expense and lower write downs of demonstration equipment  as explained below 
the company expects that selling expenses will improve as a percent of sales in fiscal year but that the dollar amount will increase as net sales increase 
the actual amount of the increase and the percent of sales depends on a number of factors  especially those factors related to the further development of the international sales and marketing teams and the development of the commercial market  which has the most rapid growth expectations 
in addition  the company intends to continue investing in areas to fuel future growth opportunities it sees 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expense dollars resulted from higher levels of personnel and related costs due to the additional infrastructure put in place in connection with the expansion of the sales staff located outside of brookings  south dakota 
also  during fiscal year  the company wrote down the carrying costs of demonstration equipment by approximately million primarily as a result of a change in estimated lives of the equipment primarily due to technology improvements and replacement with newer equipment 
the company also experienced higher postage  marketing  depreciation and various other costs as a result of investments in infrastructure in its sales expansion and the growth in net sales 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  amortization of intangibles and the costs of supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support the growth of the company  higher professional fees associated with international expansion and sales  patent and other intellectual property matters  implementation of portions of the sarbanes oxley act of  employee relations  higher costs of information systems infrastructure  charitable contributions  and insurance rates related to growth of the company 
these costs were offset by a decline in shareholder relations costs 
the company expects that general and administrative costs will rise during fiscal year but decline as a percent of net sales 
the amount of actual increase is primarily dependant on the company s international expansion efforts and information systems infrastructure needs  although other areas could impact this as well 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year related to higher compensation costs  primarily related to incentive compensation for executive management  whose incentive compensation is defined based on earnings targets  higher costs of retirement benefits for executive management  higher depreciation costs related to prior years capital investments  and higher professional fees related to higher audit costs for the fiscal year audit and legal transactional costs in general resulting from the increase in net sales 
these increases were offset by a decline in the amortization costs as the company implemented new accounting standards relating to the amortization of goodwill 
product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  and facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
generally  product design and development expenses increase when the company s engineering resources do not have to be more dedicated to long term contracts  as the same personnel who work on research and development also work on long term contracts 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were of net sales for both fiscal years and in fiscal  the company expects product design and development expenses to be equal to approximately of net sales 
product development activities increased in all four of the company s product families during fiscal and generally focused in the same areas as in fiscal year as the company enhanced and expanded its product offerings 
the transportation products area contained the greatest percentage growth increase  followed by business products 
during fiscal year  the company introduced a number of new products which resulted from its increased product development expenditures  including the galaxy series displays  the v net narrowcasting solution  and the three millimeter prostar series 
it also improved its controllers  displays and software solutions 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses decreased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
as a result of the impact of higher sales consuming more of the costs of labor and overhead of the engineering departments  product development costs declined in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in addition  costs were higher as the company spent more time on product development due to the lower than anticipated net sales and the resulting lack of work on long term contracts required by the product development staff 
the company also experienced an overall reduction in product development infrastructure in fiscal  including lower personnel costs  lower travel and entertainment costs  and lower product management costs 
interest income the company occasionally sells products on an installment basis or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display  both of which result in long term receivables that generate interest income 
it also invests excess cash in short term temporary cash investments that generate interest income 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income resulting from these long term receivables and temporary cash investments increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year interest income was approximately and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was attributable to the growth in long term receivables related to financing of customer transactions and the growth of temporary cash investments created as a result of the increased cash flow during the year 
the company believes that the levels of interest income could increase in the future as it seeks to assist customers more actively in financing purchases of equipment  assuming it can do so with acceptable levels of credit risk and interest rates 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income resulting from these long term receivables and temporary cash investments declined to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year interest income was approximately and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
interest expense the company has various amounts of debt outstanding  primarily on term loans but at times including lines of credit  which result in interest expense 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was the result of lower overall levels of debt outstanding under term loans 
the company expects that it will be able to reduce debt further in fiscal year  reducing interest expense 
this expectation could change if the company decides to make strategic investments in the future or in the event it utilizes borrowings under available lines of credit 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was the result of lower overall levels of debt outstanding under term loans and the reduction in the average amount outstanding under the company s line of credit 
income taxes fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was principally due to the higher net income on a pre tax basis 
the effective rate of for fiscal year compares to in fiscal year the change in the effective rate is primarily due to the level of international sales which generate a tax deduction for the company as well as lower anticipated state income taxes due to the mix of business by state 
the deduction related to foreign sales currently is the subject of debate in congress and is likely to change in the future  which may result in an increase in the effective rate 
therefore  the company expects that the effective income tax rate will be higher in fiscal year the key items reconciling the effective income tax rate to the statutory rates are contained in the financial statements included in this report 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was principally due to the higher net income on a pre tax basis 
the effective income tax rate was and for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of lower state income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at may  compared to million at may  the company historically has financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
cash provided by operations for fiscal year was million 
net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of approximately million and increases in both accounts payable and accrued expenses were offset by increases in accounts receivables  long term receivables  inventories  advertising rights and income taxes receivable 
cash used by investing activities consisted of million used to purchase property and equipment 
during fiscal year  the company invested approximately million in equipment to be used as demonstration equipment  primarily related to new product introductions  including its new three millimeter prostar video display  approximately million in rental equipment  approximately million on information systems hardware and software  approximately million in manufacturing equipment  and approximately million in various other items  including transportation equipment and building improvements 
these purchases were made to support the company s continued growth and to replace obsolete equipment 
cash used by financing activities included approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and in additional long term debt obligations related to the company s sports marketing business  offset by approximately million used to pay down the company s long term debt 
included in receivables as of may  was approximately million of retainage on long term contracts  all of which is expected to be collected in one year 
the company has used and expects to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  as necessary  bank borrowings to meet its short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
the company often receives a down payment or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  the company uses working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
the company s product development activities include the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products from existing technologies 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million  and million  respectively

at may   the company had million of bonded work outstanding against this line 
the company believes that if its growth extends beyond current expectations or if it makes any strategic investments  it may need to increase the amount of its credit facility 
the company anticipates that it will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from its current lender or other sources 
the company believes that its working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of its operations in the foreseeable future 
during fiscal year  the company acquired the remaining minority interest in daktronics canada  inc  formerly its majority owned subsidiary  in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the value of the stock on the date of purchase was approximately million and resulted in additional goodwill 
contractual obligations and commitments as of may   the company s debt  lease and purchase obligations were as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations   contractual cash obligations    other commercial commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments   inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations or its financial condition  although it could in the future 
business risks and uncertainties a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact the company s future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  the company s success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products  and other factors  including those set forth below 
competition could result in lower sales and decreased margins 
the company operates in highly competitive markets that  in certain portions of the business  are highly fragmented 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  the company s products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also a reduction in the prices charged by the company for its products 
to remain competitive  the company must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to its customers needs and enhance and upgrade its existing products and services to meet those needs but also continue to price its products competitively 
competitors of the company may develop cheaper  more efficient products or may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and resources than the company and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements 
the company s business may suffer if it is not successful in its efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
the company s future success in addressing the needs of its customers will depend in part on its ability to continue to make timely and cost effective product innovations and developments 
the company enters into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis 
if actual costs exceed original estimates on these contracts  profits will be reduced 
the majority of contracts the company enters into are on a fixed price basis 
although it benefits from cost savings  it has a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform 
these factors could delay delivery of products  and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs that cannot be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond the company s control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions which permit the recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit in the event a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  the company may not realize the full amount of revenues included in its backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected  and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
if the company receives relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
the company s ability to conduct business outside the united states may be adversely affected by factors outside of its control and  as such  net sales and profits from international sales could be adversely impacted 
for fiscal year  revenue outside the united states represented approximately of consolidated net sales 
in fiscal  approximately of consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside the united states 
the company s operations and earnings throughout the world have been  and may in the future be  affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and adverse tax consequences 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the company vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect the company s ability to expand its business outside of the united states 
the company s financial performance may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making it difficult to estimate future revenue 
the company s quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts entered into by the company generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects them to many factors beyond the company s control 
furthermore  as a significant portion of the company s operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on the company s quarterly operating results 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations  and operating performance in one quarter may not be indicative of future performance 
the company s products are covered by warranties 
unanticipated warranty costs for defective products could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
the company provides warranties on its products generally for terms of five years or less in the case of standard products and one year or less in the case of custom orders 
in addition  in response to customer needs  it regularly offers extended warranties 
these warranties require the company to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
while the company continually monitors its warranty claims and provides a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on operations 
in some cases  the company may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect the company s reputation 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage to protect it in the event of such a claim  its coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the company s reputation and reduce the demand for its products 
large contracts represent a significant portion of the company s accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the company closely monitors the credit worthiness of its customers and has not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of its sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
the company mitigates its exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  as some of the exposure is outside of the company s control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on its operating results 
the terms and conditions of the company s credit facility impose restrictions on the company s operations  and the company may not be able to raise additional capital  if needed 
the terms and conditions of the company s million revolving credit facility impose restrictions that limit  among other things  the company s ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions and create or incur liens 
availability of the credit facility is also subject to certain covenants as explained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
the company s ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond the company s control  and it cannot assure that it will achieve operating results meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of the credit facility and term debt  all accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
as of may   the company was in compliance with all financial and other covenants of its credit facility 
the company s ability to satisfy any debt obligations will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
it is anticipated that borrowings from the existing credit facility and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  in the event that additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the company s business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war may disrupt the company s operations as well as the operations of its customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  could create additional uncertainties forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of the company s common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of the company s common stock may not meet shareholders expectations  and the prices at which it trades may be volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception that such sales could occur 
the company may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  including technical engineering talent  which could negatively impact its operating results 
the company depends on the performance of its senior management team and other key employees  including engineering talent in product design 
the loss of certain member of its senior management  including its chairman or chief executive officer  could negatively impact its operating results and ability to execute its business strategy 
the future success of the company will also depend in part upon its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
the company does not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees but does maintain key person life insurance on the chairman of the board  the chief executive officer and the vice president sales 
provisions in the company s charter documents and under south dakota law might deter acquisition bids for the company 
there are provisions in the company s charter and other provisions under south dakota law that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company  even if doing so would benefit the stockholders 
the company is governed by the provisions of the south dakota business corporation act sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock  which in turn may have a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions that prohibit a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination  as defined in the sd act  with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the company may be unable to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company relies on a variety of intellectual property rights that it uses in its products and services 
it may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which the company s products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the company could materially and adversely affect its competitive position 
in addition  even if the company is successful in protecting its intellectual property rights or definding itself against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming 
the company maintains inventory that is subject to obsolescence and writedowns to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of the company s products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by the company is subject to the risk of obsolescence and excess levels that may not be saleable 
losses incurred as a result could have a material impact on future profits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through may   most of the company s net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has not been significant 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal year were approximately of total net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars through the company s canadian subsidiary  and a smaller portion was denominated in euros 
it is expected that in fiscal  net sales to international markets may increase as a percentage of net sales and that a greater portion of this business will be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that the company engages in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products less competitive in international markets 
the company will continue to monitor and minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s financial results in the future 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt and long term accounts receivable 
the company maintains a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of may   the company s outstanding debt approximated million  substantially all of which was in fixed rate obligations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of may  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affects its fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of certain display systems  the company has entered into various types of financing orders with customers 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of may   the company s outstanding long term receivables were approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
principal notional amount by expected maturity in thousands fiscal year ending there after assets long term receivables  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate liabilities long and short term debt fixed rate average interest rate the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet for long term receivables and long and short term debt approximate their fair values 
substantially all of the company s cash balances are denominated in united states dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances maintained in accounts of the company s canadian subsidiary 
these balances are immaterial to the company as a whole
