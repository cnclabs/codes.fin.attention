overview of the advertising environment during was difficult and challenging for many broadcasters 
economic uncertainty during both the months leading up to and during the military conflict in iraq depressed advertising demand and limited industry wide revenue growth 
in the markets in which we operate  we estimate that total market revenues generated by radio decreased by versus the prior year 
total local advertising spending in the markets in which we operate was down an estimated and national radio advertising was down for the year 
despite the down turn in total market revenues  our net revenues grew marginally on a pro forma basis as our station assets continued to mature and we continued to capture market revenue share both from our direct radio competition and from other media 
we estimate that for  our total market revenue share grew by versus the prior year 
for the year  we experienced solid revenue share growth in locally derived business  which represents approximately of our revenue 
however  our national revenue share  which declined for the year  somewhat muted our total revenue share growth 
for  our share of local revenue in the markets in which we operate grew while our national revenue share declined 

table of contents given the difficult revenue environment  the company remained strictly focused on cost control during for the year  station operating expenses  pro forma for the company s pending acquisitions  were flat versus the prior year 
the company realized savings in programming  promotions and general and administrative costs at the station level for the year as a result of overall headcount control and elimination of certain planned promotions and scheduled programming research 
these savings were offset by higher sales costs for the year as a direct result of efforts during the third and fourth quarter of to increase and strengthen our sales force 
we estimate that compared with and excluding the effects of acquisitions  we increased our total sales force by sellers  or approximately  in the company expects that these higher sales costs will stabilize during the first and second quarters of as newly hired sellers become fully trained and productive 
in preparation for a return to growth in advertising spending  we took various steps during to optimize our capital structure 
utilizing the proceeds of our may equity offering  borrowings under our credit facilities and our cash flows from operations  we successfully repurchased all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due the notes and our series a cumulative exchangeable redeemable preferred stock due the series a preferred stock 
by repurchasing these expensive debt instruments  we simplified our capital structure and reduced outstanding debt to levels that we consider prudent based on our cash flow and percentage of debt to equity 
as of december   our average cost of debt was  a significant improvement from the as of the end of the prior year 
both our lower leverage levels and lower cost of debt have significantly improved our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
we believe that by strengthening and simplifying our balance sheet  the company is well positioned to continue its growth through our operating and acquisition strategies 
cumulus also continues to be a leading acquirer of radio stations in our target sized markets 
during  the company completed million of acquisitions  adding radio stations to our platform and increasing our market presence to mid sized markets 
acquisitions completed in not only increased our total market presence but  in certain markets  increased the number of stations in a market  thus strengthening our competitive position 
our business for the period from our inception through december   we have acquired or entered into local marketing  management and consulting agreements with radio stations throughout the united states and the caribbean 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of these acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
as of december   we owned and operated stations in mid sized us media markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements to stations in us markets  pending fcc approval of the acquisition of these stations 
we also currently own five stations and have obtained a license to commence operations on one station in the caribbean market 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations 
we believe we are the eighth largest radio broadcasting company in the united states by net revenues  based on our pro forma net revenues 
we will own and operate a total of radio stations in us markets upon fcc approval and consummation of all pending acquisitions and divestitures exclusive of new market move in opportunities 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong 
table of contents listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
we are currently under contract with arbitron and receive ratings materials in a majority of our markets 
our existing five year contract with arbitron will expire on march  and we are currently in negotiations with them to renew our contract 
the use of arbitron s ratings surveys is an important part of our sales process in many markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate a contract with arbitron on terms that are satisfactory to us  nor can we predict whether or to what extent the resulting loss of arbitron s services could have an adverse effect on our ability to generate advertising revenue 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting rating is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
our use of trade agreements resulted in immaterial operating income expense during the years ended december   and of  million and million  respectively 
we continually seek to minimize our use of trade agreements 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during the years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage interep national radio sales  inc  a national representative company 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income 
see the quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  that follows in this section

further  we use station operating income  as defined above  as one of the key measurements of operating efficiency and profitability 
station operating income measures the amount of income generated each period solely from the operations of the company s stations to be used to service debt and fund acquisitions 
nevertheless  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income loss  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
as station operating income is not a measure 
table of contents calculated in accordance with gaap  this measure may not be compared to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
see the preceding quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to operating income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
pro forma net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to current year strength in local and national advertising spending 
pro forma station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  pro forma expenses were substantially unchanged year over year due to management control of operating level expenses and cost savings initiatives 
seasonality the company expects that its operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of the company s business reflects the adult orientation of the company s formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in the company s quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of the company s cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations and  to a lesser extent  working capital needs  capital expenditures  repurchases of our outstanding notes and series a preferred stock  and interest and debt service payments 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from offerings of our securities and borrowings under credit facilities 
our principal need for funds in the future is expected to include the need to fund future acquisitions  interest and debt service payments  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we believe that our presently projected cash flow from operations and present financing arrangements  including availability under our existing credit facilities  or borrowings that would be available from future financing arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our future capital needs  including the funding of pending acquisitions  operations and debt service 
however  our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or audience tastes  and borrowings under financing arrangements are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
as such  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
see risk factors 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations increased by approximately for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in operating income and a decrease in interest expense  both as compared with the year ended december  the year over year comparison of cash provided by operating activities was also effected by the timing of interest payments related to the notes 
the company has historically made its semi annual interest payments on the notes on june and december and  as a result  its interest expense on the notes has typically matched the associated cash flows 
however  during fiscal the company made only one semi annual interest payment on the notes during the period  which inflated net cash provided by operating activities for the year as compared with prior years 
the payment  which was for the interest 
table of contents accrued for the six month period ended june   totaled million 
interest which accrued for the second half of  which totaled million  was paid on january  cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities increased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  for fiscal  cash outlays related to acquisitions were consistent with the prior year 
however  in the company realized approximately million of proceeds from the sale of stations  which accounts for a lower amount of cash utilized in investing activities in the prior year 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities decreased million  to million  from million during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in the current year was primarily the result of net borrowings under the company s credit facilities million  offset by cash paid to repurchase  shares our series a preferred stock million and cash paid to repurchase million in aggregate principal of the notes million 
net cash provided by financing activities in the prior year was primarily the result of net borrowings under the company s credit facilities million and the proceeds of the company s offering of shares of its class a common stock on may  million 
cash provided by financing activities in the prior year was partially offset by a cash paid to repurchase  shares of our series a preferred stock million  b cash paid to repurchase million in aggregate principal of the notes million and c cash dividends paid on our series a preferred stock million 
historical acquisitions 
we completed the acquisition of radio stations during the year ended december  of the million required to fund these acquisitions  million was paid in the form of shares of class a common stock  million was funded in cash  million was satisfied through the issuance of a promissory note  million represented capitalizable acquisition costs and million had been previously funded as escrow deposits on the pending acquisitions 
pending acquisitions 
as of december   the company was a party to various agreements to acquire stations across markets 
the aggregate purchase price of those pending acquisitions is expected to be approximately million  of which million would be paid in cash and million would be paid in shares of the company s class a common stock 
we intend to fund the cash portion of the pending acquisitions with cash on hand  cash flow from operations  the drawings under our credit facility or future credit facilities  or sources that may be available in the future 
as of december   million of escrow deposits was outstanding related to pending transactions 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain financing necessary to consummate those remaining pending acquisitions  the company could be liable for approximately million in purchase price 
we expect to consummate most of our pending acquisitions during and  although there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated within that time frame  or at all 
in three of the markets in which there are pending acquisitions petitions to deny have been filed against the company s fcc assignment applications 
all such petitions and fcc staff inquiries must be resolved before fcc approval can be obtained and the acquisitions consummated 
in addition  from time to time the company completes acquisitions following the initial grant of an assignment application by the fcc staff but before such grant becomes a final order  and a petition to review such a grant may be filed 
there 
table of contents can be no assurance that such grants may not ultimately be reversed by the fcc or an appellate court as a result of such petitions  which could result in the company being required to divest the assets it has acquired 
the ability of the company to make future acquisitions in addition to the pending acquisitions is dependent on the company s ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing 
sources of liquidity 
we have historically financed our acquisitions primarily through the proceeds from debt and equity financings  the proceeds from asset divestitures and using cash generated from operations 
we financed the cash components of our acquisitions primarily with proceeds of borrowings under our million credit facility 
on april  the company completed an amendment and restatement of its then existing credit agreement  which  among other things  increased the aggregate principal borrowing availability from million to million 
under the amended and restated agreement  we received financing in the form of a new eight year term loan facility of million 
we used the proceeds from the eight year term loan to pay the consideration pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding notes discussed further below  and to repay the existing eight year term loan facility of million outstanding and million of outstanding revolving loan borrowings  under our existing credit facilities 
the credit facility consists of a seven year revolving commitment of million  a seven year term loan facility of million and an eight year term loan facility of million 
the amount available under the seven year revolving commitment will be automatically reduced by of the initial aggregate principal amount million in fiscal year  in fiscal year  in fiscal  in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year during  the company made scheduled principal payments of million on the seven year term loan facility and million on the eight year term loan facility 
in connection with various acquisitions completed in  the company drew down a total of million under its seven year revolving loan commitment and subsequently repaid a total of million of those borrowings during the year 
as of december   million was outstanding under the seven year term loan facility  million was outstanding under the eight year term loan facility and million was outstanding under the seven year revolving loan facility 
subsequent to december  and through february   the company repaid million of its outstanding seven year revolving loan 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of its assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted including fcc licenses held by its subsidiaries  including  without limitation  intellectual property  real property  and all of the capital stock of the company s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries except the capital stock of bsi and of the capital stock of any first tier foreign subsidiary 
the obligations under the credit facility are also guaranteed by each of the direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries  except bsi  and are required to be guaranteed by any additional subsidiaries acquired by the company 
both the revolving commitment and the term loan borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a rate equal to the alternate base rate as defined under the terms of our credit agreement  as of december  plus a margin ranging between to  or the adjusted libo rate as defined under the terms of the credit agreement  as of december  plus a margin ranging between to in each case dependent upon the leverage ratio of the company 
at december  the company s effective interest rate  excluding the effects of the interest rate swap agreement discussed below  on loan amounts outstanding under our credit facility was 
in march  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of its current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
as a result and including the fixed component of the swap  at december   the company s effective interest rate on loan amounts outstanding under our credit facility is 

table of contents a commitment fee calculated at a rate ranging from to per annum depending upon the company s utilization rate of the average daily amount available under the revolving lines of credit is payable quarterly in arrears  and fees in respect of letters of credit issued under the credit agreement equal to the interest rate margin then applicable to eurodollar rate loans under the seven year revolving credit facility are payable quarterly in arrears 
in addition  a fronting fee of is payable quarterly to the issuing bank 
the seven year term loan borrowings have been repayable in quarterly installments since june  the scheduled annual amortization is million for fiscal  million for fiscal  million for fiscal  million for each of fiscal  and and million for fiscal the eight year term loan also has been repayable in quarterly installments since june  the scheduled annual amortization is million in fiscal  million in each of fiscal years      million in fiscal and million in fiscal the amount available under the seven year revolving commitment will be automatically reduced in quarterly installments as described above and in the credit facility agreement 
certain mandatory prepayments of the term loan facilities and reductions in the availability of the revolving commitment are required to be made including i of the net proceeds from the incurrence of certain indebtedness  and ii of the net proceeds from certain asset sales 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company is subject to certain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including but not limited to maximum leverage covenants  minimum interest and fixed charge coverage covenants  limitations on asset dispositions and the payment of dividends 
the failure to comply with the covenants would result in an event of default  which in turn would permit acceleration of debt under those instruments 
at december   the company was in compliance with such financial and operating covenants 
the terms of the credit agreement contain events of default after expiration of applicable grace periods  including failure to make payments on the credit facility  breach of covenants  breach of representations and warranties  invalidity of the credit agreement and related documents  cross default under other agreements or conditions relating to indebtedness of the company or its restricted subsidiaries  certain events of liquidation  moratorium  insolvency  bankruptcy or similar events  enforcement of security  certain litigation or other proceedings  and certain events relating to changes in control 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of the credit agreement  the majority of the lenders are able to declare all amounts under our credit facility to be due and payable and take certain other actions  including enforcement of rights in respect of the collateral 
the majority of the banks extending credit under each term loan facility and the majority of the banks under each revolving credit facility may terminate such term loan facility and such revolving credit facility  respectively  upon an event of default 
on january  the company completed an amendment and restatement of its existing credit agreement  which reduced the margin applicable to both alternate base rate and adjusted libo rate borrowings under its million eight year term loan facility 
the january  amendment and restatement did not change any other material terms or restrictive covenants under the credit agreement 
we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our notes in during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company completed the repurchase of million in aggregate principal of the notes 
related to the million in aggregate principal of the notes purchased during the first quarter of  the company paid a premium of million 
in april  the company completed a tender offer and consent solicitation relating to its outstanding notes 
in the tender offer  million in principal amount of the notes were repurchased by the company and canceled  leaving million of the notes outstanding 
the company paid million in redemption premiums related to the notes tendered 
pursuant to the consent solicitation  substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes were eliminated 
as permitted by the terms of indenture governing the notes  the company called for and completed the redemption of all of the outstanding notes on july  the notes were redeemed at a redemption price of of the principal amount million in redemption premium  plus accrued interest through july  
table of contents we issued million of our series a preferred stock in connection with our initial public offering on july  the holders of the series a preferred stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an annual rate equal to of the liquidation preference per share of series a preferred stock  payable quarterly  in arrears 
on or before july   we could have  at our option  paid dividends in cash or in additional fully paid and non assessable shares of series a preferred stock 
from july  until march   we issued an additional million of shares of series a preferred stock as dividends on the series a preferred stock 
prior to the redemption of all of the outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock on july   as discussed below  all of the dividends on the series a preferred stock were paid in shares  except for million of cash dividends paid in fiscal million of cash dividends paid in fiscal and million of cash dividends paid in fiscal during the third and fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company negotiated and completed the repurchase of  shares of its series a preferred stock for million in cash 
a redemption premium of million associated with the repurchases of  shares during the three months ended march  has been included as a component of preferred stock dividends and redemption premiums in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
on july  the company completed the redemption of all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock 
the  shares outstanding were redeemed at a redemption price of million in redemption premiums plus accrued dividends through july   all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the stock designations governing the series a preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board of directors  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed and evaluated on a pooled basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company has significant intangible assets recorded in its accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill assets acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be amortized 
instead  these assets 
table of contents will be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the fair value of these assets is dependent upon the performance of our stations 
in assessing the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 which could result in our being required to write down the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill in future periods 
for  we completed the intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment test for broadcast licenses and determined that their fair value exceeded their carrying amount and  as such  did not record an impairment charge 
as a result of our transitional intangible assets with indefinite lives test completed in connection with the adoption of the statement in  we recorded to the statement of operations  a million impairment charge  net of deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
for  we also completed the impairment test of goodwill and determined that the carrying amount for each of our reporting units did not exceed the fair value and  as such  did not record a goodwill impairment charge 
no goodwill impairment charge was recorded for in connection with adopting the statement 
as of december   we had recorded billion in intangible assets and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of the company s deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within the company s net operating loss carry forward period 
as a result  the company determined it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets and recorded a million non cash charge to income tax expense for the three months ended march  the company has also recorded additional deferred tax expense of million and million to establish a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards generated during the year ended december  and  respectively  resulting from amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses that is deductible for tax purposes  but is no longer amortized in the financial statements 
should the company determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applied immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  in october  the fasb announced that the effective date of fin was deferred from july  to periods ending after december  for vies created prior to february  that are special purpose entities  as defined the standard 
all other entities are applicable as of march  fin requires existing unconsolidated vies to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among the parties involved 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vie 
the company has assessed the impact of this interpretation and has determined that several entities with which it has existing contractual relationships under lma s qualify as vies 
during various periods during  the company operated stations under local marketing agreements 
these stations were owned and licensed to ten separate entities qualifying as vies 
under these agreements  the licensee of the stations does not have the right to access the company s assets to pay general creditors 
the company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of each of the vies and  as such  these entities must be consolidated into the company s financial statements 
as of december   the company operated four radio stations under local marketing agreements  which were owned and licensed to four entities qualifying as vies 
due to the nature of the local marketing agreements  the company s historical practice has been to consolidate the operations of these entities 
as a result  the adoption of fin did not require any changes to the company s existing accounting practices  nor did it have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
during the year ended december   the stations operated under lma s contributed million to the consolidated net revenues of the company 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
on july  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results 
table of contents of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 

table of contents risk factors many statements contained in item and elsewhere in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations

risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment 
radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business 
our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  cable and broadcast television  outdoor advertising  the internet and direct mail 
in addition  many of our stations compete with groups of two or more radio stations operated by a single operator in the same market 
audience ratings and market shares fluctuate  and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of stations located in that market 
while we already compete with other stations with comparable programming formats in many of our markets  any one of our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or revenue and could require increased promotion and other expenses  and  consequently  could have a lower station operating income  if another radio station in the market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to our station or launch aggressive promotional campaigns  a new station were to adopt a competitive format  or an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations 
the telecom act allows for the consolidation of ownership of radio broadcasting stations in the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
some competing consolidated owners may be larger and have substantially more financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  increased consolidation in our target markets may result in greater competition for acquisition properties and a corresponding increase in purchase prices paid for these properties by us 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of competition from new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
various new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face many unpredictable business risks that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our operations are subject to many business risks  including certain risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these include changing economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry in particular  shifts in population  listenership  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition from existing or future technologies for advertising revenues  including  but not limited to  other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations  newspapers  the internet  and other entertainment and communications media  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the us department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these risks will have on our future operations 
there are risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue to grow through internal expansion and by acquiring radio station clusters and individual radio stations primarily in mid size markets 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing these acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions will be 
consummation of our pending acquisitions and any acquisitions in the future are subject to various conditions  such as compliance with fcc and antitrust regulatory requirements 
the fcc requirements include approval of license assignments and transfers  limits on the number of stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market  and other rules or policies  such as the ownership attribution rules  that could limit our ability to acquire stations in certain markets where one or more of our stockholders has other media interests 
the antitrust regulatory requirements include filing with the us department of justice and the federal trade commission under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  referred to as the hsr act  where applicable  expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act  and possible review by the us department of justice or the federal trade commission of antitrust issues under the hsr act or otherwise 
we cannot be certain that any of these conditions will be satisfied 
in addition  the fcc has asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process  even where proposed assignments would comply with the numerical limits on local radio station ownership in the fcc s rules and the communications act of  referred to as the communications act 
our acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks  including risks associated with identifying acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations  diverting management s attention from other business concerns  potentially losing key employees at acquired stations  and the diminishing number of properties available for sale in mid size markets 

table of contents we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions or manage the resulting business effectively  or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate 
in addition  we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous acquisitions 
depending upon the nature  size and timing of potential future acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional financing in order to consummate additional acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our debt agreements will permit the necessary additional financing or that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that financing would be on terms acceptable to our management 
because a significant portion of our total assets is represented by intangible assets and goodwill that is subject to mandatory  annual impairment evaluations  we have written off  and could in the future be required to write off  a significant portion of these assets  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have acquired businesses that have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase prices for these businesses was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets  principally fcc broadcast licenses  based on estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions 
any excess purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
prior to january   the cost of fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
effective january   upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
as required by the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we compared the estimated fair values of our fcc broadcast licenses to the book values by market and  as a result of the comparison  took a charge in the first quarter of of million  net of taxes 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we were required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we were required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit within six months of january  to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
based on the results of its first step test  we were not required to perform the second step test on any of our reporting units 
we completed our annual impairment evaluation of existing broadcast licenses during the fourth quarter of the fair values of all broadcast licenses exceeded their carrying values and  as a result  no impairment existed 
the company also completed its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and  as a result  no impairment existed 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be adjustments for impairment of either broadcast licenses or goodwill in future periods 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of the cost of our broadcast licenses for financial reporting purposes upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
as a result  we determined it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and we recorded a million non cash charge to income tax expense during the first quarter of in addition to this charge  we established a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets created when certain broadcast licenses were written down as a result of the transitional impairment test for broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
the company has also recorded additional deferred tax expense of million and million to establish a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards generated during the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting from amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses that is deductible for tax purposes  but is no longer amortized in the financial statements 
our management has determined that it is more likely than 
table of contents not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances  at december  our ability to generate revenue could be affected by economic recession 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recessions or downturns 
furthermore  because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers  our ability to generate advertising revenue in specific markets is directly affected by local or regional economic conditions 
a continued recession  or a downturn in the us economy  or in the economy of any individual geographic market in which we own or operate stations  could have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel  and our loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand  train and manage our employee base 
we have entered into employment agreements with some of our key management personnel that include provisions restricting their ability to compete with us under specified circumstances 
we also employ several on air personalities with large loyal audiences in their individual markets 
the loss of one or more of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share in that particular market 
the broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must also comply with the extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  the signals transmitted by our radio stations could be impaired by other radio stations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we are required to obtain prior fcc approval for each radio station acquisition 
the consummation of radio station acquisitions requires prior approval of the fcc with respect to the transfer of control or assignment of the broadcast licenses of the acquired stations 
the fcc could prohibit or require the restructuring of our future acquisitions  or could propose changes in its existing rules that may reduce the number of stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets 
in addition  where acquisitions would result in certain local radio advertising revenue concentration thresholds being met  the fcc staff has a policy of reviewing applications for proposed radio station acquisitions with respect to local market concentration concerns  and specifically invites public comment on these 
table of contents applications 
this policy may help trigger petitions to deny and informal objections against fcc applications for our pending acquisitions and future acquisitions  as well as fcc staff requests for additional information 
there can be no assurance that the fcc will approve potential future acquisitions 
risks related to our indebtedness we have substantial indebtedness that could have a material adverse effect on us 
as of december   our long term debt  including the current portion  was million  representing approximately of our stockholders equity 
our credit facilities have interest and principal repayment and redemption obligations that are substantial in amount and would have a substantial impact on our stockholders 
the level of our indebtedness could have several important consequences to you 
you should note that a substantial portion of our cash flow is  and will be  dedicated to debt service and is not  and will not be  available for other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future  certain of our borrowings are  and will be  at variable rates of interest  which may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  our leveraged position and the covenants contained in our credit agreement could limit our ability to compete  expand or make capital improvements  and our level of indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
our ability to fulfill our debt obligations could be adversely affected by many factors 
our ability to repay our debt obligations will depend upon our future financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  competitive  technological  legislative and regulatory factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to repay our debt in the future 
in the absence of sufficient operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be required to reduce or delay planned acquisitions  expansions and capital expenditures  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional equity capital  or restructure our debt 
if liquidity problems require us to take any of these actions  we cannot provide you any assurance as to the timing of any sales or the proceeds that we could realize from these sales  our ability to obtain additional equity capital or successfully complete a restructuring of our debt  or whether these sales  additional equity capital or restructuring of debt could be effected on terms satisfactory to us or at all 

table of contents our credit facilities impose significant restrictions on us 
our credit facilities restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make particular types of investments or make other restricted payments  enter into some types of transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with any other person  or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  our credit facilities also restrict our ability to incur liens or to sell some assets 
our credit facilities also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot be sure that we will maintain those ratios or meet those tests 
a breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default under our debt agreements 
our lenders have taken security interests in substantially all of our consolidated assets  and we have pledged the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if an event of default under our credit facilities occurs  our credit facility lenders could declare all amounts outstanding  including accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
if we could not repay those amounts  those lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure that indebtedness 
if our credit facility indebtedness were accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
our ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities will depend upon our future performance and various other factors  such as business  competitive  technological  legislative and regulatory factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our existing credit facilities  our lenders could declare all amounts owed to them immediately due and payable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
this agreement is intended to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  which are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk as a result of the acquisition of caribbean communications company ltd  ccc  the company has operations in five countries throughout the english speaking caribbean 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company has operations 
the company maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations generated net income of less than million for the year ended december  
table of contents it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the eastern caribbean dollar or the trinidad and tobago dollar would change net income for the year ended december  by an amount less than million
