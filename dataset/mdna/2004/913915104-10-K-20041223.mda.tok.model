item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under cautionary factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report on form k 
general overview we are a leading provider of post secondary education for students seeking careers as professional automotive  diesel  collision repair  motorcycle and marine technicians 
we offer undergraduate degree  diploma or certificate programs at eight campuses across the united states  and manufacturer sponsored advanced programs at dedicated training centers 
we have provided technical education for nearly years 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide and are presented as net revenues after reductions related to guarantees and scholarships we sponsor and refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates 
we recognize tuition revenue and fees ratably over the terms of the various programs we offer 
we supplement our core revenues with additional revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies  student housing provided by us and other revenues  all of which are recognized as sales occur or services are performed 
in aggregate  these additional revenues represented less than of our total net revenues in each fiscal year in the three year period ended september  tuition revenue and fees generally vary based on the average number of students enrolled and average tuition charge per program 
average student enrollments vary depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but decide to re enroll during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
we believe that our average student enrollments are influenced by the number of graduating high school students  the attractiveness of our program offerings to high school graduates and potential adult students  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts  the depth of our industry relationships  the strength of employment markets and long term career prospects  the quality of our instructors and student services professionals  the persistence of our students  the length of our education programs  the availability of federal funding for our programs  the number of graduates of our programs who elect to attend the advanced training programs we offer and general economic conditions 
our introduction of additional program offerings at existing schools and establishment of new schools either through acquisition or start up are expected to significantly influence our average student enrollment 
our average undergraduate student enrollments 
table of contents have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of over the past three full fiscal years 
this growth can largely be attributed to the demand for our graduates and the expansion of our capacity 
we currently offer start dates at our campuses that range from every three to six weeks throughout the year in our various undergraduate programs 
the number of start dates of advanced programs varies by the duration of those programs and the needs of the manufacturers who sponsor them 
our tuition charges vary by type or length of our programs and the program level  such as undergraduate or advanced training 
tuition has increased by approximately to per annum in each fiscal year in the three year period ended september  tuition increases are generally consistent across our schools and programs  however  changes in operating costs may impact price increases at individual locations 
we believe that we can continue to increase tuition as the demand for our graduates remains strong and tuition at other post secondary institutions continues to rise  although any of those increases may be less than past increases 
most students at our campuses rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in our fiscal year  approximately of our net revenues were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we extend credit for tuition and fees to the majority of our students that are in attendance at our campuses 
our credit risk is mitigated through the students participation in federally funded financial aid programs unless students withdraw prior to the receipt by us of title iv funds for those students 
any remaining tuition receivable is comprised of smaller individual amounts due from students across the united states 
we categorize our operating expenses as i educational services and facilities and ii selling  general and administrative 
major components of educational services and facilities expenses include faculty compensation and benefits  compensation and benefits of other campus administration employees  facility rent  maintenance  utilities  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the provision of educational services  royalties payable to licensors under our licensing arrangements and other costs directly associated with teaching our programs and providing educational services to our students 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits of employees who are not directly associated with the provision of educational services such as executive management  finance and central accounting  legal  human resources and business development  marketing and student enrollment expenses including compensation and benefits of personnel employed in sales and marketing and student admissions  costs of professional services  bad debt expense  costs associated with the implementation and operation of our student management and reporting system  rent for our home office  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that is not used in the provision of educational services and other costs that are incidental to our operations 
all marketing and student enrollment expenses are recognized in the period incurred 
costs related to the opening of new facilities  excluding related capital expenditures  are expensed in the period incurred 
costs associated with the implementation of our student management and reporting system have increased over the last several years as we installed a new integrated information network that tracks inquiries from potential students and supports our student enrollment and processing of data as it relates to our student activities 
we anticipate that we will need to further upgrade our student management and reporting system and expect additional costs will be incurred in connection with such an upgrade 
we believe that the investment in our student management and reporting system has improved services to students and our ability to track student inquiries and may facilitate the integration of new schools into our operations  if and when new schools are opened or acquired 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock in an initial public offering for approximately 
table of contents million in net cash proceeds  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses of approximately million 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  we effected a  to one stock split 
certain stockholders sold  shares of our common stock in the initial public offering 
in addition  our outstanding series d preferred stock automatically converted to common stock upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
accordingly  the approximately  outstanding shares of series d preferred stock representing a liquidation value of million were converted into an equivalent number of shares of our common stock which  upon giving effect to the stock split  amounted to  shares of common stock 
also in december  we consummated an exchange offer pursuant to which we offered to exchange the then outstanding shares of our series a  series b and series c preferred stock for shares of our common stock at an exchange price per share equal to our initial public offering price of 
an aggregate of  shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock  representing a liquidation value of approximately million  were presented for exchange and we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in connection with that exchange 
we used million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to redeem all of the outstanding shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock that were not exchanged for shares of common stock and to pay all the accrued and unpaid dividends on all the series of our preferred stock  whether or not exchanged 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  property and equipment  long lived assets  including goodwill  income taxes and contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
net revenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for guarantees and scholarships we sponsor 
tuition and fee revenue is recognized on a pro rata straight line basis over the term of the course or program offered 
if a student withdraws from a program prior to a specified date  any paid but unearned tuition is refunded 
approximately of our net revenues for the fiscal year  of our net revenues for the fiscal year and of our net revenues for the fiscal year  consisted of tuition 
our net revenues vary from period to period in conjunction with our average student population 
the majority of our undergraduate programs are typically designed to be completed in to months and our advanced training programs range from to weeks in duration 
we supplement our core revenues with sales of textbooks and program supplies  student housing provided by us and other revenues 
sales of textbooks and program supplies  revenue related to student housing and other revenue are each recognized as sales occur or services are performed 
deferred tuition represents the excess of tuition payments received as compared to tuition earned and is reflected as a current liability in our consolidated financial statements because it is expected to be earned within the following twelve month period 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expenses not covered by financial aid programs which are unsecured and not guaranteed 
management analyzes accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts  customer credit worthiness  when applicable  and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we use an internal group of collectors  augmented by third party collectors as deemed appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial 
table of contents condition of our students deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased selling  general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made 
healthcare and workers compensation costs 
claims and insurance costs which primarily relate to health insurance and workers compensation are accrued using current information and  in the case of healthcare costs  future estimates provided by consultants to reasonably measure the current cost incurred for services provided but not yet invoiced 
although we believe our estimated liability recorded for healthcare and workers compensation costs are reasonable  actual results could differ and require adjustment of the recorded balance 
bonus costs 
we accrue the estimated cost of our bonus programs using current financial and statistical information as compared to targeted financial achievements and actual student graduation outcomes 
although we believe our estimated liability recorded for bonuses is reasonable  actual results could differ and require adjustment of the recorded balance 
tool sets 
we accrue the estimated cost of promotional tool sets offered to students at the time of enrollment and provided at a future date based upon satisfaction of certain criteria  including completion of certain course work 
we accrue these costs based upon current student information and an estimate of the number of students that will complete the requisite coursework 
although we believe our estimated liability for tool sets is reasonable  actual results could differ and require adjustment of the recorded balance 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate these assets to determine if their current recorded value is impaired by examining estimated future cash flows 
these cash flows are evaluated by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying value of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
at september   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets  or million  and was a result of our acquisition of the parent company of our mmi operation in january although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
several companies recently elected to change their accounting policies and record the fair value of 
table of contents options as an expense 
we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee stock option exercise price or restricted stock purchase price equals or exceeds the deemed fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
if we had estimated the fair value of the options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and then amortized this estimated fair value over the vesting period of the options  our net income loss would have been adversely affected  as shown in the table below 
year ended september  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss available to common shareholders as reported add stock based compensation expense included in reported net income  net of taxes deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined using the fair value based method  net of taxes net income loss pro forma earnings per share basic as reported earnings per share diluted as reported earnings per share basic pro forma earnings per share diluted pro forma accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in our statement of operations as a provision for or benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   we had a valuation allowance of million to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that management believes is more likely than not realizable 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to a deferred tax asset arising from a capital loss carryforward from the sale of a discontinued business and expires in should we incur capital gains in the future  we would be able to realize all or part of the capital loss carryforward against which we have applied the valuation allowance 
in that event  our current income tax expense would be reduced or our income tax benefits would be increased  resulting in an increase in net income or a reduction in net loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin r replaces the same titled fin that was issued in january fin r provides guidance on when certain entities should be consolidated or the interest in those entities should be disclosed by enterprises that do not control them through majority voting interest 
under fin r  entities are required to be consolidated by enterprises that lack majority voting interest when equity investors of those entities have insignificant capital at risk or they lack voting rights  the obligation to absorb expected losses  or the right to receive expected returns 
entities identified with these characteristics are called variable interest entities  or vies  and the interests that enterprises have in these entities are called variable interests 
these interests can derive from certain guarantees  leases  loans or other arrangements that result in risks and rewards that are disproportionate to the voting interests in the entities 

table of contents the provisions of fin r must be applied for vies created after january  and for variable interests in entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
for all other vies  implementation is required by march  our adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recording of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective for all awards granted or modified after june  and provides transition guidance for recording expense related to employee service for the fair value of awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and measured in accordance with the previously issued sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we estimate that the effect of adopting sfas no 
r  based upon outstanding equity awards as of september  will be approximately million for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
this estimate does not include the impact of additional equity awards which may be granted or forfeitures which may occur subsequent to september  and prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended september  net revenues operating expenses educational services and facilities selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense interest expense related parties other expense income total other expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues 
our net revenues for the year ended september  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to net revenues of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the average undergraduate full time student enrollment and an increase in the average tuition charge per student resulting from tuition increases of between and  depending on the program 
for the year ended september   the average undergraduate full time student enrollment was  compared with  for the year ended september  we have accommodated the increase in average student enrollment by improving the utilization of our existing facilities  opening our new exton  pennsylvania campus in july and expansion efforts at four of our existing facilities 
educational services and facilities expenses 
our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended september  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to educational services and facilities expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to incremental education expenses related to higher average student enrollments  including additional costs of million incurred in connection with the start up and operation of our new exton  pennsylvania campus that we opened in july  an additional charge of approximately million for depreciation related to a change in the estimated useful life of leasehold improvements and a million charge for the early exit of a lease for a campus that we relocated in september to provide additional capacity 
the increases in educational services and facilities expenses is partially offset by a million reduction in estimated tool set expenses 
educational services and facilities expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended september  as compared to for the year 
table of contents ended september  the decrease in educational services and facilities expenses as a percentage of net revenues is attributable to increased revenues and operating efficiencies resulting from increased average student enrollments at our existing facilities and a favorable adjustment of our estimated tool set expense  partially offset by the costs attributable to the opening and operation of the new exton  pennsylvania campus and accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements related to a campus relocation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to incremental compensation and fringe expenses related to additional sales representatives to support new applicants and administrative personnel to support the growth in operations  advertising expenses associated with student leads  administrative expenses for operations as a public company  legal costs and employee training initiatives 
this increase also includes approximately million in costs associated with the start up of our new exton  pennsylvania campus 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat at for the years ended september  and september  interest expense 
our interest expense for the year ended september  was million  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the average debt balance outstanding as a result of our early repayment of approximately million in term debt using proceeds received from our initial public offering in december other expenses 
our other expenses for the year ended september  represent the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately million related to the early repayment of the term loans under our senior credit facilities with proceeds received from our initial public offering completed in december and the termination of our credit facility at september  income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended september  was million  or of pretax income  compared to million  or of pretax income  for the year ended september  the higher effective tax rate for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to the non deductible costs related to the secondary offering of our common stock and an increase in tax reserves 
income from continuing operations 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported income from continuing operations for the year ended september  of million  as compared to income from continuing operations of million for the year ended september  fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues 
our net revenues for the year ended september  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to net revenues of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the average undergraduate full time student enrollment during the year ended september  and an increase in the average tuition charge per student resulting from tuition increases of between and  depending on the program  and a shift in the mix of average student enrollments toward higher priced programs  particularly following the introduction of our higher priced nascar programs at our new mooresville  north carolina nti campus opened in july for the year ended september   the average undergraduate full time student enrollment was  compared with  for the year ended september  we have been able to accommodate the increase in student enrollments by improving the utilization of our existing facilities  opening our new nti campus in july and expanding many of our existing facilities 
educational services and facilities expenses 
our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended september  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to educational services and facilities expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due 
table of contents to incremental education expenses related to higher average student enrollments  including additional costs of million incurred in connection with the start up and operation of our new nti campus that we opened in july educational services and facilities expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to of net revenues for the year ended september  from for the year ended september   primarily due to cost and operating efficiencies resulting from increased enrollments at our existing campuses  partially offset by the costs attributable to the opening and operation of the new nti campus 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  this increase was due in large measure to the incremental increase in marketing and student enrollment expenses in the period to support future growth in student enrollments  which includes additional costs of million relating to the new nti campus that we opened in july selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to of net revenues in the year ended september  compared to of net revenues in the year ended september  this decrease is primarily due to operating efficiencies resulting from increased enrollments at our existing facilities  partly offset by the costs attributable to the opening of our new campus 
interest expense 
our interest expense for the year ended september  was million  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended september  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the average debt balance outstanding and a decrease in the average interest rate paid on our indebtedness to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the reduction in the average debt balance outstanding was principally due to the repayment of million of subordinated notes and repayment of million of long term debt under our existing senior credit facilities with proceeds received from the issuance of our series d convertible preferred stock in april  as well as scheduled repayments under the senior credit facilities and repayment of million of long term debt under our existing senior credit facilities with available cash on hand during july we also repaid approximately million of a subordinated convertible promissory note at a discount in august the decrease in the average rate of interest we paid on our indebtedness was primarily attributable to the repayment of the subordinated notes that carried a higher fixed interest rate  decreases in the libor rates and a reduction in the applicable interest margin under our senior credit facilities as a result of our improved financial condition and the amendment of our senior credit facilities 
other expenses 
our other expenses for the year ended september  represent the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately million as a result of the amendment of our senior credit facilities in april income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended september  was million  or of pretax income  compared to million  or of pretax income  for the year ended september  the increase in the effective rate is primarily attributable to higher state taxes for the year ended september   as all available state net operating loss carryforwards were utilized in the year ended september  in addition  a higher federal statutory rate applied to the year ended september   as well as an increase in our state tax rates that primarily impacted deferred tax items for the year ended september  income from continuing operations 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported income from continuing operations for the year ended september  of million  as compared to income from continuing operations of million for the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources we finance our operating activities and our internal growth through cash generated from operations 
our net cash from operations was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents a majority of our net revenues are derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year thirty week periods 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in two disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received days after the start of a student s academic year and the second disbursement is typically received at the beginning of the sixteenth week from the start of the student s academic year 
certain types of grants and other funding are not subject to a day delay 
our undergraduate programs are typically designed to be completed in to months 
these factors  together with the timing of when our students begin their programs  affect our operating cash flow 
net cash from operations increased million  or  from million to million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to increased operating performance of approximately million  which includes the effect of increased depreciation expense and other non cash charges  the timing of tuition funding and other working capital changes 
the timing of tuition funding resulted in an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million resulting in a combined positive cash flow of approximately million 
this represents an increase in cash flow of approximately million from the comparable year ended september  and is attributable to an increase in average student enrollments partially offset by the increase of approximately million related to our new exton  pennsylvania campus as we await title iv approval for this location 
in addition to the timing of tuition funding and increased operating performance  cash flow from operations was also impacted as a result of providing million in cash to collateralize our issued letter of credit to ed  offset partially by increased accounts payable and accrued expenses attributable to the increased level of operations necessary to support average student growth 
net cash from operations increased approximately million  or  from million to million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to increased operating performance  accounts payable  accrued expenses related to the purchase of supplies and equipment as a result of the increase in average student enrollments  accrued salaries and related benefits and accrued health care benefits from a self insured benefit plan 
capital expenditures our cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment and capital improvements 
our capital expenditures primarily result from the addition of new and the expansion of existing facilities  ongoing replacements of equipment related to student training  our computer network and student management and reporting systems 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal year was primarily attributable to a new facility  relocation and expansion efforts  investment in tools  classroom technology and other equipment that support our programs 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures to equip classrooms  labs and administrative office space at our new exton  pennsylvania campus  approximately million in capital improvements as we completed expansion efforts at our glendale heights  illinois campus and approximately million in capital expenditures related to leasehold improvements and training equipment for the addition of an automotive training program at our existing orlando  florida campus 
the increase in cash flow used in investing activities during the fiscal year was primarily attributable to the acquisition of additional training aids and equipment related to student training to support the growth of our student population  including approximately million related to our campus in mooresville  north carolina which was opened in july capital expenditures are expected to increase as we upgrade and expand current equipment and facilities or open new facilities to meet increased student enrollments 
we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 

table of contents the following is a summary of our current material capital expenditure commitments in september  we entered into a real estate purchase agreement and an agreement to retrofit the existing building for a campus to be located in the boston suburb of norwood  massachusetts 
a new undergraduate automotive technician training program is planned to be offered at this campus 
the purchase price is approximately million and approximately million to million is expected to be spent to retrofit the existing building prior to the planned opening in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
the campus is planned to provide approximately  square feet of classroom and lab space on a total of acres 
the campus is planned to accommodate approximately  students at maturity 
in the next fiscal year  we will continue to equip our new exton  pennsylvania and orlando  florida automotive programs 
in addition  we intend to expand certain of our existing programs 
capital expenditures related to these activities are estimated to be million 
our strategy includes considering strategic acquisitions in the future 
to the extent that potential acquisitions are large enough to require financing beyond cash from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  we may incur additional debt  resulting in increased interest expense 
debt service our total debt was million as of september   million as of september  and thousand as of september  the following schedule sets forth our long term debt obligations as of the fiscal years ended september   and year ended september  in thousands revolving credit facility term a loan facility payable to bank term b loan facility payable to bank mandatory redeemable series a preferred stock mandatory redeemable series b preferred stock mandatory redeemable series c preferred stock subordinated promissory note payable to shareholders and related parties subordinated convertible promissory note payable capital leases total debt less current portion total long term debt on september   we terminated our million revolving credit facility and on october  replaced it with a new million revolving credit facility and a million standby letter of credit facility 
on december   we used proceeds received from our initial public offering to repay all of the then outstanding term debt totaling million 

table of contents we adopted sfas accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective july  accordingly  we reclassified as a liability the mandatory redeemable series a  series b and series c preferred stock totaling million at september  on december   in connection with our completed initial public offering  we either redeemed this preferred stock or exchanged such stock for shares of common stock 
effective september   we terminated our revolving credit facility which had previously provided us the availability of million to be used for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit issued under the facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had an outstanding letter of credit of million issued to ed at the time of termination 
in connection with the termination of the credit facility  we provided million in cash collateral for the million letter of credit  which expired on november  on october   we entered into a new credit agreement with a bank for a revolving line of credit in the amount of million and a standby letter of credit facility for up to million 
we have the option to issue letters of credit either under the revolving line of credit  which reduces our borrowing ability or under the standby letter of credit facility 
the standby letter of credit facility is collateralized by a cash collateral account equal to the advance rate  as defined and dependent upon the underlying collateral investment  multiplied by the issued and outstanding letters of credit 
effective november   we issued a letter of credit in the amount of million in favor of ed to replace the previously issued million letter of credit maturing on november  the new letter of credit is collateralized in the amount of million held in us government guaranteed bonds 
the increase in the letter of credit is attributable to the increase in title iv funds that we received during our fiscal year as a result of the growth in our average student enrollment 
the new credit agreement requires interest to be paid quarterly in arrears on outstanding amounts borrowed under the revolving line of credit 
the interest rate is based upon the lender s prime interest rate less per annum or libor plus per annum  at our option 
the revolving line of credit also requires an unused commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears equal to per annum 
issued letters of credit bear fees of per annum under the revolving line of credit and per annum under the standby letter of credit facility 
fees for issued letters of credit are payable quarterly in advance 
our new credit agreement contains various financial and non financial covenants 
the facility  among other things  restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens or other security interest  make certain investments  become liable for contingent obligations or dispose of assets or stock of our subsidiaries 
our new credit agreement also requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  which are adjusted over time  as follows we are required to have minimum quarterly net income of million we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth equal to our tangible net worth at september   which was million 
we are required to maintain a total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  as defined in the agreement  of to at december   which decreases to to at september  and to at september  and thereafter 
we are required to maintain a current ratio of to at december   which increases to to at september  and to at september  and thereafter 
furthermore  our new credit agreement contains customary events of default as well as an event of default in the event that any of our institutions loses any accreditation necessary for title iv program eligibility  or the ability of any

table of contents seasonality our net revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in total student population and costs associated with opening or expanding our campuses 
student population varies as a result of new student enrollments  graduations and student attrition 
historically  our schools have had lower student populations in our third fiscal quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with changes in student population and net revenues and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the second and third quarters of our fiscal year ended september  were favorably impacted by an increase in student population at our nti campus  which resulted in increased revenue and operational efficiencies during those two quarters 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new school openings  new program introductions and increased enrollments of adult students 
in addition  our net revenues for the first fiscal quarter are adversely affected by the fact that we do not recognize revenue during the calendar year end holiday break  which falls primarily in that quarter
