item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the expressed purpose of availing itself of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all of such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements describe future plans or strategies and include the corporation s expectations of future financial results 
the corporation s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain and the corporation can give no assurance that those results or expectations will be attained 
factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to i general market rates  ii changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  iii general economic conditions  iv real estate markets  v legislative regulatory changes  vi monetary and fiscal policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve  vii changes in the quality or composition of the corporation s loan and investment portfolios  viii demand for loan products  ix the level of loan and mbs repayments  x deposit flows  xi competition  xii demand for financial services in the corporation s markets  and xiii changes in accounting principles  policies or guidelines 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the corporation does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that require the use of judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgment as well as other systematic objective and quantitative methods 
assets are evaluated at least quarterly and risk components reviewed as a part of that evaluation 
see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies allowances for loan losses for a discussion of risk components 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the use of judgment 
mortgage servicing rights are established on loans that are originated and subsequently sold 
a portion of the loan s book basis to mortgage servicing rights is allocated when a loan is sold 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from the servicing relationship using current market assumptions for prepayments  servicing costs and other factors 
as the loans are repaid and net servicing revenue is earned  mortgage servicing rights are amortized into expense 
net servicing revenues are expected to exceed this amortization expense 
however  if actual prepayment experience exceeds what was originally anticipated  net servicing revenues may be less than expected and mortgage servicing rights may be impaired 
judgment is also used in the valuation of other intangible assets core deposit intangibles 
core deposit intangibles have been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that have been acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit intangible assets have been recorded using the assumption that they provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replace by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
the current estimate of the underlying lives of the core deposits is seven to fifteen years 
if it is determined that these deposits have a shorter life  the asset will be adjusted to reflect an expense associated with the amount that is impaired 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment  which requires judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of an acquisition in which purchase price exceeded fair value of net assets acquired 
the price paid for the acquisition is analyzed and compared to a number of current indices 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
the following discussion is designed to provide a more thorough discussion of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations as well as to provide additional information on the corporation s asset liability management strategies  sources of liquidity and capital resources 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this decrease in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a decrease of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
in addition  non interest expense increased million 
exclusive of the effects of the implementation of fin  non interest income increased million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non interest income of million and a decrease in tax expense of  exclusive of the effects of the implementation of fin  non interest expense increased million 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million during fiscal due to a smaller increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in the rates of interest earning assets as compared to the decrease in the rates of interest bearing liabilities 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread decreased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds  offset by a larger decrease in yields on loans as interest rates continue to decrease 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the decrease of million in net interest income stemmed from net rate volume decreases in interest earning assets of million which were greater than net rate volume decreases of interest bearing liabilities of million 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
although there was a decrease in net charge offs of  in fiscal  primarily due to increased mortgage and commercial business loan recoveries and decreased mortgage loan charge offs  there was an increase in non accrual loans  particularly in commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented 
of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon management s assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimable future losses 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowance as they carry a higher risk of loss 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the addition of real estate investment partnership revenue of million for fiscal as a result of the implementation of fin during the period 
exclusive of the effects of fin  non interest income increased million primarily as a result of the increase of loan servicing income of million and the increase of net gain on sale of investments and mortgage related securities of million for fiscal the gain on sale of securities was largely due to the sale of a group of mortgage backed securities that were sold to reach their maximum profit potential in relation to the changing interest rate environment 
the increase in loan servicing income was primarily due to an increase in fee income from sales in fhlb mortgage partnership finance and a decrease in the amortization of omsr s due to a decrease in loan sales in latter fiscal service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits and insurance commissions increased  due to increased sales for fiscal partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
net gain on sale of loans decreased million largely due to the increasing interest rate environment which resulted in significantly lower levels of refinancing activity 
loan refinance activity and the ability to recognize gains from the sale of fixed rate loans is significantly dependent on decreasing interest rates and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the level of loan refinance activity and gains from the sale of loans recorded in prior periods can be sustained in future periods 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  decreased  and other revenue expense from real estate operations decreased  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the addition of rei partnership cost of sales of million  other expenses from real estate partnership operations of million and minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations of million for fiscal as a result of the implementation of fin during the period 
exclusive of the effects of fin  non interest expense increased million primarily due to the increase in compensation expense of million 
the increase in compensation expense was largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production earlier in the fiscal year 
occupancy expense increased  due to increased maintenance and repairs  increased leasehold rental  and increased depreciation 
in addition  furniture and equipment expense increased  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs and increased depreciation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in data processing expense and a decrease of  in other non interest expense in fiscal for more information on the effects of the implementation of fin on the consolidated operations of the corporation  see item note  real estate held for development and sale and variable interest entities

loan servicing income decreased million due to increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
net income from operations of real estate investments also decreased  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
the majority of the increase was attributed to an increase in compensation expense of million  largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production 
occupancy expense increased million due to increased maintenance and repairs and increased depreciation 
data processing expense increased  and other non interest expense increased  due to increases in postage and other expenses 
in addition  furniture and equipment expense increased  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs and increased depreciation expense  and marketing expense increased  during this fiscal year

financial condition general 
total assets of the corporation increased million  or  from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was primarily funded by net increases in federal home loan bank and other borrowings of million and by net increases in deposits of million 
these funds were generally invested in loans receivable which increased by million 
mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity decreased million as a net result during the year of i purchases of million  ii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iii sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million of mortgage backed securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity and million of mortgage derivative securities million were available for sale and  were held to maturity at march  the decrease of mortgage related securities was largely due to the sale of a group of mortgage backed securities that were sold to reach their maximum profit potential in relation to the changing interest rate environment 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security  and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable 
total net loans including loans held for sale increased million during fiscal from billion at march  to billion at march  the activity included i originations of billion  ii sales of billion  and iii principal repayments and other reductions of billion 
see note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements included in item for more information 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased to million or of total assets at march  from million  or  of total assets at march non performing assets are summarized as follows for the dates indicated at march  dollars in thousands non accrual loans single family residential      multi family residential commercial real estate    construction and land consumer commercial business    total non accrual loans      real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  net    total non performing assets      performing troubled debt restructurings   total non accrual loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to total non accrual loans allowance for loan and foreclosure losses to total non performing assets non accrual loans increased million in fiscal to million at march  this increase was largely attributable to a million increase in non accrual commercial real estate loans and was partially offset by decreases in non accrual single family  multi family  commercial business and consumer loans 
the increase in non accrual commercial real estate loans was largely attributable to three loans 
one was a million loan secured by a unit hotel in kenosha  wisconsin 
the second was a million loan secured by retail property located in dallas  texas 
the third was a million loan secured by a unit student housing apartment building located in minneapolis  minnesota 
at march   there were two other non accrual commercial loans with carrying values greater than million 
one was a million commercial business loan secured by a milling machining company located in montello  wisconsin which was added to non accrual loans in the fiscal year ended march  the second was a commercial real estate loan which is secured by a unit motel located in schiller park  illinois  with a carrying value of million at march  loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
non performing real estate held for development and sale decreased slightly by  during fiscal at march   there were no properties in non performing real estate held for development and sale with a carrying value greater than million 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  in fiscal this increase was not attributable to any one property 
the total of performing troubled debt restructurings at march  increased by  and includes one loan with a carrying value greater than million 
the troubled debt restructuring is a commercial real estate loan secured by a room lodge located in sonoma  california  with a carrying value of million  which was acquired in the acquisition of ledger capital corp 
on november  allowances for loan and foreclosure losses 
the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  and repossessed assets are evaluated on a continuous basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and losses inherent in the portfolio 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
to determine the level and composition of the loan loss allowance  the loan portfolio is broken out by categories of single family residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate  construction and land  consumer and commercial business 
these categories are then further divided into performing and substandard  which includes performing and non performing groups of loans 
a five year historical trend is applied to each category of performing loans to arrive at the appropriate levels of loss reserves for those respective categories based on the ratio of loss history to overall balance in each respective loan category 
the non performing groups are analyzed using the trends of the current year in which they are being evaluated 
for commercial business loans  a three year historical trend is applied since that category has shown significant growth both in terms of overall balance and loss history associated with that growth 
the corporation has allocated all of its allowance for loan losses to specific categories as a result of more precise analysis of loan portfolio performance 
also  within specific loan categories  certain loans may be identified for specific reserve allocations as well as the whole category of that loan type being reviewed for a calculated general reserve based on the foregoing analysis of trends and overall balance growth within that category 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers

historically  the corporation s non performing and classified assets have fluctuated with economic trends  both locally and nationally 
at march   the bank s present level of classified assets increased million from the year ended march  this increase is in keeping with local and national economic conditions 
management believes that the present level of the allowance at march  is prudent 
loan charge offs were million and million for the fiscal years ending march  and  respectively 
total charge offs for the years ended march  and increased  and decreased  respectively  from the prior fiscal years 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to a increase of  in commercial business charge offs and an increase in consumer charge offs of  offset by a decrease in mortgage charge offs of  the decrease in charge offs of  for fiscal was largely due to a decrease of  in commercial business loan charge offs 
mortgage loan charge offs increased  while consumer loan charge offs decreased  for the year ended march  recoveries slightly offset the charge offs for the year ended march  and such recoveries increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal recoveries increased  during the fiscal year ended march management believes that the decreased level in net charge offs of  for the year ended march  and the decreased level in net charge offs of  for the year ended march  do not represent changes in the quality of the loan portfolio  but instead generally reflect the local and national trends in overall consumer debt levels and bankruptcy filings

management also continues to pursue all practical and legal methods of collection  repossession and disposal  and adheres to high underwriting standards in the origination process in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality 
deposits 
deposits increased million during fiscal to billion  of which million was due to increases in certificates of deposit and million was due to increases in passbook accounts 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in money market accounts and a million decrease in now accounts 
the increases were due to promotions and related growth of deposit households as interest rates begin to edge upward in the latter part of fiscal the weighted average cost of deposits decreased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end borrowings 
fhlb advances increased million during fiscal because the low interest rate environment did not encourage as great an increase in deposits needed to fund mortgage refinances 
at march   advances totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of compared to advances of million with a weighted average interest rate of at march  other loans payable increased million from the prior fiscal year 
other loans payable were largely comprised of other borrowings of the partnerships  of idi s subsidiaries  of million 
per fin  such borrowings are consolidated into the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item stockholders equity 
stockholders equity at march  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets at march  stockholders equity increased during the year as a result of i comprehensive income of million  which includes net income of million and a decrease in net unrealized losses on available for sale securities included as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income of million  ii the exercise of stock options of million  iii the vesting of recognition plan shares of  and iv the tax benefit from certain stock options of million 
these increases were partially offset by i the purchase of treasury stock of million ii the payment of cash dividends of million  iii the common stock held in a rabbi trust of million  and iv the purchase of stock by retirement plans of million 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation 
the bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations relative to its ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that the corporation will not be adversely affected by these dividend limitations and that projected future dividends from the bank will be sufficient to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
in addition to dividends from the bank  the corporation also could sell capital stock or debt issues through the capital markets as alternative sources of funds  as well as obtain loans from outside banks 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank is required by the ots to maintain levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of us government and agency securities and other investments sufficient to ensure its safe and sound operation 
at march  and  the bank s liquidity ratio was and  respectively 
the regulatory requirements for liquidity are discussed in regulation in item in fiscal  operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million of net proceeds from the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and billion for the origination of loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal repayments on loans of billion  proceeds of sales and maturities of investment securities of million  and million of principal repayments received on mortgage related securities 
financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million including a net increase in deposits of million  a net increase in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 
at march   the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans  commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million  and  of loans sold with recourse to the corporation in the event of default by the borrower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item commitments to extend funds typically have a term of less than one year 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march  amounted to million  and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide blocks of funds at specified interest rates for an identified fee 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commitments at march  payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations other long term liabilties total contractual obligations      at march   the bank s capital exceeded all capital requirements of the ots as mandated by federal law and regulations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management 
the primary function of asset and liability management is to provide liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within specified maturities and or repricing dates 
interest rate risk is the imbalance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a given maturity or repricing date  and is commonly referred to as the interest rate gap the gap 
a positive gap exists when there are more assets than liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
a negative gap occurs when there are more liabilities than assets maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
the corporation s strategy for asset and liability management is to maintain an interest rate gap that minimizes the impact of interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
as part of this strategy  the corporation sells substantially all new originations of long term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  invests in adjustable rate or medium term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans  invests in medium term mortgage related securities  and invests in consumer loans which generally have shorter terms to maturity and higher and or adjustable interest rates 
the corporation occasionally sells adjustable rate loans at origination to private investors 
the corporation also originates multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  which generally have adjustable or floating interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity than conventional single family residential loans 
long term  fixed rate  single family mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market are generally committed for sale at the time the interest rate is locked with the borrower 
as such  these loans involve little interest rate risk to the corporation 
although management believes that its asset liability management strategies reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s operations  material and prolonged changes in interest rates would adversely affect the corporation s operations 
the corporation s cumulative net gap position at march  for one year or less was a positive of total assets  as compared to a positive at march  the calculation of a gap position requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
management believes that its assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially
