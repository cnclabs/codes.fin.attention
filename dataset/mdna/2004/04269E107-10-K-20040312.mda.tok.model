item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of small molecule cancer therapeutics 
we also provide fee based chemistry services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to produce novel chemical compounds with drug like characteristics 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million from inception through december  our expenses prior to september related to development activities associated with our chemistry services  the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts  and the cost of acquisitions 
we expect research and development costs to increase in as we pursue development of our cancer programs 
we do not expect to make additional investments in chemistry services during although we have generated positive cash flow from operations for the last five years  we have recorded a net loss for each of those years 
we expect to record a loss for based on our cash position at the end of we will be able to dedicate approximately million per year over the next three years to our act sm research and development 
table of contents program 
this estimate is based upon the assumption that we will continue to operate our chemistry services on a cash flow positive basis  and to invest in cancer related research and development 
our revenue is derived from chemistry services performed for our customers 
revenue  expenses and gross margin fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon contractual deliverables and the timing of the recognition of revenue under our revenue recognition policy see the discussion of this under critical accounting policies and estimates below 
as we increase our activities in cancer related research and development  the timing and extent of these efforts  together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials will further impact the fluctuation of results from operations 
while our focus will be on cancer related research and development  we will continue to pursue revenue opportunities from customers for our chemistry services 
in february  we initiated a restructuring involving a reduction in workforce of people  or of the total workforce 
this was undertaken to better align our resources with our new focus on cancer related research and development  and in response to a decrease in chemistry services activities 
we plan to aggressively hire expertise in the field of drug discovery during  and anticipate no net headcount decrease by the end of the year 
liquidity and capital resources increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
for the total of million was primarily comprised of an operating profit  excluding non cash charges  of million and additional restructuring provisions of million not requiring immediate cash outlays in  which were partially offset by restructuring related payments of million  and million of payments related to liabilities assumed in the acquisition of cyclis 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
the total was million in  compared to million in the increase in was due to million for the cyclis acquisition and million for capital additions  which was partially offset by net proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities of million 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets and the timing of specific investments 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities 
the total was million in  compared to million in the use was comprised of million of principal repayments on our term loan to fleet national bank and million of long term debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of cyclis and subsequently repaid 
this was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  of which million represents an investment by pfizer 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for five consecutive years 
we expect that our available cash and marketable securities of million at december   together with operating revenues and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements for the next three years 
in addition  we are currently considering raising additional capital through a follow on public offering of our securities 
we have filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering securities having an aggregate maximum amount of million 

table of contents our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into any additional corporate collaborations in the future and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  the need for currently unanticipated capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers for our chemistry services  or that such services will produce revenues adequate to fund our operating expenses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
if we experience increased losses  we may have to seek additional financing from public and private sale of our securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or on acceptable terms 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands within within within after total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately million related to unoccupied real estate in california which was accrued as a liability  net of assumed sublease income  as a part of the company s restructuring charges in see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information 
revenue recognition arqule has entered into various chemistry based collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
revenue from these collaborative agreements is recognized as follows non refundable technology transfer fees 
under certain circumstances these are recognized as revenue upon completion of performance of a specified deliverable 
however  where the effort is relatively constant over the performance period of the contract  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period of the contract 
funding of compound development work 
revenue is recognized over the term of the applicable contract using the proportional achievement of deliveries against a compound delivery schedule  or the development labor expended against a total research and development labor plan  as the measure of progress toward completion 
payments based upon delivery of compounds 
payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborator s specified criteria are recognized as revenue once our obligations are complete  the collaborator has accepted the delivery of these compounds and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
if there are no continuing performance obligations  these revenues are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
revenues from milestone payments related to continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of a specified list of conditions are met 
otherwise  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the performance obligations 
we follow these guidelines to measure revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of these policies 
for example  in connection with our pfizer collaboration we have recorded current and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
the estimate of deferred revenue reflects our estimate of the timing and extent of services that we will provide to pfizer 
our services to pfizer  and the timing of those services  are difficult to estimate and are impacted by factors outside of our control 
for example  the timing and quantity of compounds we provide is largely dependent on pfizer s internal needs 
changes to estimates could impact the timing and amount of revenue we recognize in the future 
purchase accounting and in process research and development upon consummation of the cyclis acquisition  we immediately charged to income million representing purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
approximately million of the charge represents the fair value of the ipr d  the remaining million of the charge represents the allocation to ipr d of a portion of the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired 
we believe that this charge represents a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributed to purchased ipr d 
the value assigned ipr d before the step up adjustment was composed of the projected value of three cyclis preclinical drug development projects based on various mechanisms of actions associated with the act sm technology 
the valuation was determined using the income approach 
potential revenue and drug development expenses were projected through based on information obtained from management and from published third party industry statistics for similar drug development businesses 
specifically  we estimated that the development of our current cancer programs through clinical trials to commercial viability will take approximately nine years and cost in excess of million 
the discounted cash flow method was applied to the projected cash flows  adjusted for the probability of success  using a discount rate of 
the discount rate takes into consideration the uncertainty surrounding successful development and commercialization of the ipr d 
since the acquisition  nothing has occurred that would lead us to believe that the original estimates of the cost to develop these compounds  or their revenue potential  is materially different from the estimates used at the time of the acquisition for purposes of purchase accounting 
restructuring charges accruals for abandoned facilities under lease require significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning our ability to sublease certain operating leases for abandoned real estate see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this k 
these estimates of the time required to sublease the facilities and sublease rates the company will receive were based on our analysis of the local real estate markets and general economic conditions in the regions of the abandoned facilities 
if it takes longer to sublease these facilities than the company has estimated  or if the sublease rates are less favorable than estimated  the company may be required to take an additional charge for abandoned real estate of up to million 
conversely  if the space is subleased either earlier than estimated or if the sublease rates actually achieved are more favorable  the company may be required to reverse a portion of its current accrual for abandoned real estate 
investments in non marketable equity securities at december   we performed an assessment of the fair value of our investment in a privately held proteomics company 
this assessment included analysis of that company s current financial condition  its 
table of contents prospects for generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this analysis it was our judgment that an impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was million  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
if this entity is unsuccessful in its efforts to secure additional financing it may cease operations  rendering our investment worthless and necessitating a further write down 
if the value of this investment recovers  we will not write up the investment until it is sold 
lease commitments we lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in medford  massachusetts  the majority of which is used for the pfizer collaboration 
we lease these facilities from cummings properties  llc cummings under two lease agreements  one of which expires on july  and one of which expires on july  the company subleases portions of these facilities pursuant to two sublease agreements 
on august   cummings significantly raised arqule s rent  as outlined in item  legal proceedings 
we made an estimate of the most likely outcome of this contingency and concluded that no provision is required at december  it is our estimation that the most likely settlement at trial would result in no net financial statement loss 
nevertheless  if we are unsuccessful at trial  the company could be required to record an additional expense of up to 
million 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue increase decrease to to in millions revenue as compared to revenue increased by million  or 
revenue from our chemistry collaboration with pfizer increased by million due to an increase in the number of compounds developed under the terms of the contract and our receipt of certain contractual milestone payments on an accelerated basis because we met delivery requirements in ahead of schedule 
this increase was offset by reductions in revenue from bayer of million  solvay of million  and pharmacia of million as the company completed its final contractual obligations with these companies in  and from reductions in revenue from searle of million  wyeth of million and glaxo smith kline of million whose contracts all ended in we expect revenue from our chemical services contracts to decrease in as a result of february amendments to our pfizer agreement that will cause our compound deliveries to pfizer to remain stable at levels  instead of increasing as previously agreed 
in addition  in we completed the bayer  solvay and pharmacia agreements 
as compared to revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to a million increase in custom array library revenues from our agreement with pfizer 
this increase was partially offset by reductions in revenue from wyeth of million  from johnson johnson of million  and from sankyo of million as these collaborations wound down 
cost of revenue and gross margin percentage increase decrease to to cost of revenue gross margin of revenue pts pts 
table of contents as compared to cost of revenue increased due to increased cost of personnel  materials and facility related expenses  including depreciation  necessary to satisfy the increase in activity under the pfizer contract during  partially offset by a reduction in material costs associated with the completion of the bayer contract during the third quarter of gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily as a result of the one time increase in pfizer revenue due to our receipt of certain contractual milestone payments on an accelerated basis because we met delivery requirements in ahead of schedule and to the recognition of previously deferred revenue from bayer as a result of our completing our contractual obligations 
the associated costs for which were incurred in earlier years 
we expect cost of revenue will decrease in as a result of lower revenues and the resultant decrease in direct production and material costs due to the absence of activity under the bayer  solvay and pharmacia agreements  which were terminated in we expect gross margin percentage to decrease in as a result of the lower revenues available to offset fixed overhead and facility related expenses 
as compared to cost of revenue increased due to increased cost of personnel and materials necessary to satisfy the expansion of the pfizer collaboration 
our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased by percentage points due to the increased labor and material costs necessary to fulfill the pfizer and bayer collaborations 
research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development as compared to the million decrease in research and development primarily reflects the cost savings associated with the company s decision in december to cease further development of the camitro predictive modeling technology  to close the related facilities in redwood city  california effective december  and cambridge  united kingdom effective march   and to realign its workforce in order to expedite its transition to a drug discovery and development company 
these cost savings were partially offset by the increased cost associated with the acquisition of cyclis in september  notably the addition of approximately scientists  increased laboratory supply and facility expenses and the cost of preclinical and clinical studies to develop the act sm platform and arq we expect research and development expense to increase in as we expand our oncology discovery pipeline and begin clinical trials 
as compared to the million increase primarily consists of an additional million in personnel and related costs and million of additional third party information system technology as the result of our efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry  biology  predictive and computational modeling capabilities and related proprietary technologies 
in  the company devoted additional personnel and resources to the integration and refinement of the respective technologies in order to advance the objective of a fully integrated drug discovery platform 
marketing  general and administrative increase decrease to to in millions marketing  general and administrative as compared to the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expense is primarily due to the cost savings associated with the severance of marketing  general and administrative employees as part of the company s restructuring actions in december  and the closing of the redwood city and cambridge facilities 
the decrease consists primarily of reductions in employee related expenses of million  professional fees of million and facility related expense of million 
we expect marketing  
table of contents general and administrative expense to decrease in as a result of our restructuring actions in the first quarter of and due to conscious efforts to contain infrastructure spending 
as compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses were essentially flat year over year 
acquisition related charges in millions stock based compensation amortization of core technology amortization of goodwill impairment of core technology impairment of goodwill in process research and development total acquisition related charges acquisition related charges in relate to the september  acquisition of cyclis 
upon consummation of the cyclis acquisition  we immediately charged to income million representing purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
approximately million of the charge represents the fair value of the ipr d 
the remaining million of the charge represents a step up adjustment resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed which was allocated on a pro rata basis to the carrying value of acquired long lived assets 
see critical accounting policies and estimates above for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant estimates 
and acquisition related charges in and all relate to the january acquisition of camitro 
upon consummation of the acquisition in january  we immediately charged to income million representing the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this k 
in  we continued to recognize stock based compensation charges based on the amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of stock options issued below market value and restricted stock to former employees of camitro  in addition to amortizing core technology 
we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in january  and accordingly ceased recording periodic goodwill amortization charges in lieu of performing annual assessments for impairment 
at december   we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of our core technology and goodwill balances and  based on the applicable accounting standards  recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  representing the entire remaining balances of these assets 
see critical accounting policies and estimates above for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant estimates 
restructuring related charges in december  we announced a restructuring of our operations whereby we ceased further development and commercialization of the camitro predictive modeling technology and realigned our workforce to expedite the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company 
the restructuring actions included closing our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom  along with the termination of employees in these facilities and our massachusetts facilities 

table of contents the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million  the components of which are as follows in thousands termination benefits facilities related other charges total restructuring charges termination benefits relate to severance and benefit costs associated with the elimination of managerial and staff positions worldwide  comprising approximately of the workforce 
facility related costs relate to the remaining lease payment obligations associated with the abandonment of our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge and the non cash write off of leasehold improvements and equipment no longer expected to provide future economic benefit at the abandoned facilities  less assumed proceeds from sale 
other charges include a million non cash stock compensation charge  contractual obligations which provided no future value to the company  and other miscellaneous costs associated with closing the california and united kingdom operations 
see item in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at item of this k 
we believe that these actions resulted in savings of approximately million per year in personnel and facility related expenses 
activities against the restructuring accrual which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in and were as follows in thousands restructuring restructuring non cash cash accrual at charge write offs payments december  termination benefits facilities related other charges total restructuring accrual restructuring restructuring accrual at cash accrual at december  provisions payments december  termination benefits facilities related other charges total restructuring accrual the company eliminated positions in december  the remaining were eliminated by march  as of december  virtually all termination benefits had been paid 
california facility costs will be paid out through the remaining lease term of the facility  which extends through  unless we are able to mitigate such costs by subleasing the facility or settling our leasehold position by paying a lump sum payment to the landlord 
in october  arqule completed an agreement with inpharmatica ltd 
to sell certain assets of its former operations in the united kingdom 
as a result  arqule reversed million of restructuring accrual to reflect a change in its original estimate of the remaining leasehold obligations and assumed sublease income in the united kingdom 
throughout the latter half of  arqule was in negotiations with a third party to sublease its facility in california on favorable terms 
those negotiations were terminated in january as a result  the adequacy of the accrual relative to the lease obligation and assumed sublease income for the california facility was reassessed  and based on continued deterioration in the local real estate market  an additional provision of million was recorded
