item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in the report 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company makes judgments regarding revenue recognition and evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  asset impairment and warranty obligations 
we describe these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company considers many factors in the evaluation of revenue recognition  including customer acceptance criteria  complexity of installation and integration into production lines 
the company generally recognizes revenue for machine sales upon shipment and installation for the initial machine model sold to a customer 
revenue is generally recognized for subsequent machine sales to a same customer upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss have transferred and the model  configuration  and application is substantially similar to the original machine installed 
at the time of shipment  the company accrues for any related de minimus and perfunctory installation costs to be incurred 
revenue for manufacturing services  custom factory automation services  engineering design bundled with a machine order  machine accessories  and spare parts are recognized upon shipment of product or deliverable and transfer of title and risk of loss 
revenue for engineering design services are billed upon completion and delivery of design documentation 
billable field service labor revenue is recognized upon completion 
overall revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement in the form of a contract or purchase order  the product has been shipped and or installed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering the customer s financial condition  security deposits  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and the related material usage  field service and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the company can be subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
some of these matters include professional liability  employee related matters  and investigations by governmental agencies regarding our employment practices 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such assessments against the company  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
factors that may affect financial condition and future results the company operates in industries that are highly competitive 
industry participants confront aggressive pricing practices by competitors  continually changing customer demand patterns  and rapid technological developments 
the following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report 
o continued weak global economic conditions or lack of electronics industry manufacturing capacity expansion could adversely impact the company s revenues and growth rate 
o the loss of a major customer listed in business dependence on significant customers and the inability to fill the void with sales to replacement customers 
o the continued transfer of manufacturing offshore could contract the market for labor saving assembly equipment and adversely impact the company s dataplace machine sales 
o the competitive environment in the electronics assembly machine  custom factory automation equipment and contract manufacturing industries place pressure on revenue  gross margins  and market share 
o erosion of the financial condition of customers could adversely affect the company s business 
o the potential for technological obsolescence of the dataplace label identification line 
o the availability of electronic components may be limited due to changes in demand or supply and could adversely affect the company s material costs or ability to fulfill customers order requirements 
o the inability to invest in or acquire a new venture that can absorb excess manufacturing capacity or contribute to the company s return to profitability could adversely affect the company s business 
o the inability of the company to execute management s plans to return to profitability could result in default on the terms of the union bank of california reimbursement agreement  which supports the stand by letter of credit guaranteeing the company s performance on the industrial development bonds 
in the event the company defaults  and is unable to present a viable turn around plan satisfactory to its bank  such event could cause the bank to require the company to seek a substitute guarantor  re finance its manufacturing and office facility in san marcos  california with alternative financing or sell the san marcos  california facility 
the inability of the company to successfully substitute a guarantor or to re finance its building could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
o the inability of the company to sustain the nasdaq minimum closing bid price requirement would result in de listing from the nasdaq small cap market and require the company to seek listing on the otc bulletin board and could adversely affect the company s per share market price 
o the effects of worldwide conflict and instability upon revenues and costs 
o other factors described in item a

results of operations compared to  cont d amistar industrial automation segment aia label identification machine demand increased during resulting in the shipment of nine units in compared to four units in of the units sold in  four of the machines represented the dataplace lp model and five the m model 
during  the company sold four dataplace machines  three lp models and one m model 
compared to the dataplace lp machine  the m is suitable for applications requiring less functionality and sells at a lower price 
beginning in  continuing through  and to a lesser extent in  the company had been severely affected by the overall economic slow down and excess in domestic manufacturing capacity 
the contraction in product volumes compared to manufacturing capacity among the company s label placement machine customer base resulted in a lack of sales of the company s dataplace machine for the first two quarters of during the quarter ended september   the company was able to sell one dataplace machine and the company rented another for a three month evaluation term and  during the quarter ended december   the company sold three machines 
the company took steps during to minimize costs in response to the recession driven decline in demand for its label identification automation equipment 
those steps included the reduction of its sales and field service support staff during the year and reductions in dataplace lp production 
at december   the company had  based on forecasts  an approximate to month supply of dataplace machine inventory 
at december   the company had ten completed dataplace machines included in finished goods inventory at a carrying value of  the carrying value of dataplace work in process was  at december  the aia work in process and raw material inventories consist primarily of the dataplace machine product line 
the company has considered the current and projected state of the machine s technology  its expected future competitive position  and has made estimates of anticipated dataplace demand upon continued economic recovery 
estimates of future demand are highly subjective and subject to material change

sales have increased since the fourth quarter of  when the company resumed its role as the leading north american distributor for i pulse products 
during  the company entered into an increased number of contracts for custom factory automation design and manufacturing services compared to the company served customers in the eye glass lens  luggage tagging  and veterinary supply industries 
certain contracts for custom automation design services have the potential to result in follow on contracts for prototype machine development and production machine manufacturing services 
contract manufacturing services segment continued to exhibit the soft demand for us based manufacturing services experienced in during  sales were negatively impacted by migration of certain customer s production off shore  the effect of which more than offset the increased sales to a new customer in the bank security industry added during the later part of during the period of soft demand  the division focused much of it efforts during improving operations and manufacturing efficiencies  which resulted in improved profitability compared to during  the division reduced its operating loss to  compared to an operating loss of  in results of operations compared to company overall sales overall sales decreased to  from  in  a decrease of 
the decline in sales was related primarily to the decline in ams sales 
no portion of sales was attributable to inflation for the manufacturing services division ams sales decreased to  or from primarily due to decreased shipments to a customer who moved their product manufacturing offshore and due to a customer that chose to produce previously out sourced products in house 
ams sales represented and of the overall sales for and respectively 
aia label identification machine unit shipments were flat in compared to at units each 
of the units sold in  three of the machines represented the dataplace lp model and one the m model  all of which were sold during the last four months of during  the company shipped its first golf shaft labeling machine to a leading golf equipment manufacturer

gross profit gross profit increased  to  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to a  charge taken in to increase inventory reserves for the company s assembly machine products 
in addition  improvements in labor efficiency and factory utilization partially offset by a  charge taken to increase dataplace and ams inventory reserves resulted in improved margins during selling expenses selling expenses decreased  to  in from  in due to aia machine products sales and service staff reductions  consolidation of sales and service offices  lower commission expense  and reduced division marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense decreased  in from the decrease in was primarily due to a  restructuring charge related to the closure of the anaheim  california contract assembly facility  a  increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in  a  decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts in and a  decrease in salary expense for certain executives and administrative staff during engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development efforts in were focused on a laser identification machine and a golf club shaft labeling machine dataplace sbl 
engineering expense was incurred in support of aia custom factory automation sales 
expenses declined in from due to fewer development projects and staff reductions 
other income expense interest income decreased  in  compared to  due to lower average cash balances during and decreases in interest rates earned on money market funds

compared to the dataplace lp machine  the m is suitable for applications requiring less functionality and sells at a lower price 
an expanded discussion of the segment s position in relation to dataplace marketability can be found in the analysis of sales for the company overall 
at december   the company had nine completed dataplace machines included in finished goods inventory at a carrying value of  the carrying values of dataplace work in process and component parts were  and  respectively at december  the aia work in process and raw material inventories consist primarily of the dataplace machine product line 
the company has considered the current and projected state of the machine s technology  its expected future competitive position  and has made estimates of anticipated dataplace demand upon economic recovery 
estimates of future demand are highly subjective and subject to material change 
as a result  the company recorded an inventory write down of dataplace machines totaling  during although the company was able to resume shipments during the last four months of  insufficient demand in the future for the dataplace label identification machines could require additional charges for excess quantities or obsolescence 
during  the aia division continued to expand its offering of engineering and manufacturing services to customers having requirements beyond custom factory automation 
the engineering group provided design and prototype services for a specialty product used in the veterinary industry 
contract manufacturing services segment during  experiencing difficult economic conditions  one of the company s major customers moved their production offshore 
the decline in sales was partially offset by sales growth that came from the company s base of medical product customers who increased orders over in addition  a portion of the ams sales growth came from increased quick turn prototype services to a major test equipment customer 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows provided from operating activities were  during  compared to a usage of cash of  in and a usage of cash of  in the improvement during was primarily due to the reduced loss and decrease in non cash working capital 
working capital decreased  in  and increased  in in  and  investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures to increase the capabilities of the ams division and to improve efficiency 
the company repurchased  as part of an on going initiative    and  shares of its stock on the open market at values of   and  during the years of  and  respectively 
the company financed its  square foot manufacturing and office facility located in san marcos  california through  of bonds issued by the industrial development authority of the city of san marcos in the bonds carry a variable interest rate and mature in december payments of principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by a  irrevocable letter of credit issued by the company s bank 
the terms of the irrevocable letter of credit required the company in to establish a  interest bearing cash collateral account restricted cash in order to meet a required loan to value ratio 
in  the amount of restricted cash was revised to  on february   the company paid  to redeem a portion of the industrial development bonds utilizing the restricted cash balance of  plus an additional  of unrestricted cash 
the company s obligation under the irrevocable letter of credit was reduced accordingly by  effective on february  effective march   the company began making monthly payments of  per month into a sinking fund for redemption of the bonds 
redemption is scheduled to occur in increments of  as the funds accrete to the minimum redemption level 
on february    of the bonds were redeemed using restricted cash 
the terms of the reimbursement agreement require the company to make annual payments of  in january and and the balance of  in december the company s stand by letter of credit reimbursement agreement with its bank maintains certain affirmative financial covenants 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the tangible net worth  debt service and profitability covenants 
the company received waivers relating to these covenants through march  the company has made all required debt service payments on the bonds 
however  based on the uncertainty concerning the company s ability to meet the covenants after the waiver expires  and considering that a covenant violation would constitute an event of default which would allow the bank to call the debt prior to maturity  the entire industrial development bonds balance of  has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet at december  the inability of the company to return to profitability could result in default on the terms of the union bank of california reimbursement agreement  which supports the stand by letter of credit guaranteeing the company s performance on the industrial development bonds 
in the event the company defaults  and is unable to present a viable turn around plan satisfactory to its bank  such event could cause the bank to require the company to seek a substitute guarantor  re finance the san marcos facility with alternative financing or sell the facility 
the company believes it would be able to obtain alternative financing  although at terms less favorable than present 
the inability of the company to substitute successfully a guarantor or to re finance the building could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company will continue to seek waivers for any covenant violations in the future until a modification of the covenants can be negotiated 
management believes that as a result of the reduction in the loss in compared to and the achievement of positive operating cash flow defined as net loss plus depreciation and amortization for  the bank s comfort in the company s ability to continue as a viable company and service its debt has improved greatly and that the bank more than likely will continue to forbear until december  when the bond term expires 
the company expects to refinance the building when the bonds come due in december  with a conventional fully amortized loan from a new lender at rates in line with the current market for such a loan 
the company s primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents and working capital 
if the bank continues to grant waivers on the irrevocable letter of credit reimbursement agreement  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents provided from operations and cash and cash equivalents balances at december  will be adequate to support its operating  investing and financing requirements through in the event the bank chooses to forebear no longer  management would consider several options which include utilizing some portion of cash  re financing the san marcos  california building with alternative financing  a sale leaseback or sale of the san marcos  california facility and relocation to a leased facility 
management believes that it has the ability to execute its alternate plans in the event that payment of the company s industrial bonds would be required in  and the company would have adequate finances to fund its operating  investing and financing activities through under either scenario for repayment of its industrial bonds 
contractual commitments and commercial commitments the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period less than contractual obligations year years years after years minimum lease payments   sublease income   net lease obligations   industrial bonds payments   the company did not have any employee agreements or purchase commitments outside of the company s normal course of business at december  new accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued fasb interpretation no
