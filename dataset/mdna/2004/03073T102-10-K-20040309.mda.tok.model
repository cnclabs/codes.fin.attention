item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a multi state managed health care company focused on serving people who receive health care benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  schip and familycare 
we were founded in december with the objective to become the leading managed care organization in the united states focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
calendar year was our second full year as a public company and our first year trading on the new york stock exchange 
in we increased our total revenues by over our revenue growth came from a number of factors including external growth through acquisitions effective january   we acquired the outstanding stock of php holdings  inc and its subsidiary  physicians healthcare plans  inc 
together  php 
with the acquisition of php  we began providing our products to approximately  additional members located in three florida markets tampa  orlando and fort lauderdale miami 
effective july   we acquired the medicaid contract rights and related assets of st 
augustine which operates in nine counties in the miami fort lauderdale  orlando and tampa markets and served approximately  members 
obtaining rate increases from the states in which we operate in a difficult state budgetary environment  we leveraged our partnerships with our states and received rate increases 
successfully integrating members we received from a competitor exiting a market during the third quarter of  we successfully integrated approximately  members in texas which came to us from a competitor exiting that market 
implementing new product or program expansions we expanded into two new counties in florida 
we successfully insourced our behavioral health benefits servicing approximately  members in four states and the district of columbia 
we believe this strategy optimizes member health status  and reinforces our mission to coordinate our members physical and behavioral health and positions us well for future growth in existing states 
expanding in existing service areas our same store premium revenues increased over recent developments the state of florida oversubscribed its schip or florida healthy kids program and thus faced a state funding shortfall 
the initial response from the state was to create a temporary waiting list 
florida recently announced a plan to possibly fund up to  additional schip members 
the state of texas has announced its intent to award amerigroup a contract for the travis service area  which includes austin and additional counties  bringing the number of counties that we serve in the state to we are currently finalizing the terms with the state and expect operations to begin in summer while initial estimates of growth are modest  this service area complements our long term growth strategy 
currently  these counties are served by only one other health plan 
in  our health benefits ratio was versus in the through effective early case finding  disease management  reductions in membership related to less profitable products and continued improvement in our claims payment efficiencies  our medical costs remain stable and predictable 
technological improvements during the last year helped us to maintain our sg a ratio consistent with the prior year at 
an example of our technological improvements is the increase in usage of our 
table of contents interactive voice response system  which handled million calls in without the interaction of a live representative agent 
over the last several years  our efforts to leverage our expenses have proven successful  resulting in a decreasing sg a ratio 
cash and investments totaled million at the end of a portion of this cash is regulated by state capital requirements 
however  million of our cash and investments was unregulated and held at the parent level 
we expect acquisitions to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy 
over of our membership has resulted from nine acquisitions and we are currently evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
we believe the proceeds from our recent public offering  our undrawn credit facility and our cash flows from operating activities position us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for health benefit services for our members 
we generally receive premiums in advance of arranging for services  and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed premium per member per month is paid to us to arrange for health care benefit services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
in all of our states except florida  we receive supplemental payments for obstetric delivery 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is notified according to our contract 
we recognize revenue in the period that the newborn is delivered and related services were provided to our member 
additionally  in some states we receive supplemental payments for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
any amounts that have not been received from the state by the end of the period are recorded on our balance sheet as premium receivables 
we also generate income from investments 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits  as well as our ability to accurately predict costs incurred in recording the amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to health benefits have two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include fees paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  radiology  dental and vision 
medically related administrative costs include expenses related to services such as health promotion  quality assurance  case management  disease management and hour on call nurses 
direct medical expenses also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical payments related to fees paid on a fee for service basis to our pcps  specialist physicians and other providers  including fees paid to third party vendors for ancillary services 
the balance related to fees paid on a capitation  or per member  basis 
primary care and specialist physicians not paid on a capitated basis are paid on a maximum allowable fee schedule set forth in the contracts with our providers 
we reimburse hospitals on a negotiated per diem  case rate or an agreed upon percent of their standard charges 
in maryland  the state sets the amount reimbursed to hospitals 

table of contents we have used the same methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical liabilities since our inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims and market experience 
as medical utilization patterns and cost trends change from year to year  our underlying claims payments reflect the variations in experience 
our estimates are revised based upon actual claims payments using historical per member  per month claims cost  including provider settlements  changes in the age and gender of our membership and variations in the severity of medical conditions 
these variations are considered in determining our current medical liabilities and adjusted to reflect expected changes in cost or utilization patterns 
there are certain aspects of the managed care business that are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state eg  cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births  and the number of neonatal intensive care babies as well as non medical aspects  such as changes in provider contracting and contractual benefits 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix and growth of members 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including authorization data and prior claims experience 
authorization data is information captured in our medical management system  which identifies services requested by providers or members 
the medical cost related to these authorizations is estimated by pricing the approved services using contractual or historical amounts adjusted for known variables such as historical claims trends 
these estimated costs are included as a component of ibnr 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims  and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in claims payment patterns  membership  products and authorization trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustments are included in current operations 
we utilize the services of independent actuarial consultants  who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
judgments are made based on knowledge and experience about past and current events 
there is a likelihood that actual results could be materially different if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
also included in claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to or from contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
the following table shows the components of the change in medical claims payable for the years ended december   and in thousands medical claims payable as of january medical claims payable assumed from businesses acquired during the year health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years recognized during  and were attributable to lower than anticipated utilization and pricing of medical services 
due to the variable nature of claims  our methodology includes adding a factor to compensate for uncertainty 
the more precisely we have been able to predict claims patterns  the lower the required factor for 
table of contents uncertainty 
the health benefits expenses incurred during the period related to prior years relate almost entirely to revisions in estimates for the immediately preceding year 
the application of our methodology  even in a changing environment  has resulted in reversals of estimated incurred claims related to the prior year in each of the years in the three year period ended december  the resulting impact on operations is a function of the variation of the change in estimate from year to year 
in certain circumstances we adjust claims for overpayments 
a portion of these adjustments may not be collected  so we estimate a historical factor to offset the expected recoupment 
changes in estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
since our estimates are based upon the blended per member  per month claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experience 
these variables include fluctuations in claims payment patterns  changes in membership levels  number and mix of products  benefit structure  severity of illness and authorization trends 
we believe there will be less volatility as we increase in size and gain more maturity in our markets 
we believe that the amount of claims payable is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of claims payable and actual claims payable  net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted rates  including estimated tax rates in states where we do business applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years 
historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and  we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  net of accumulated amortization 
we review our intangible assets with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future utility and cash flows and other internal and external factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios for the years ended december   and all ratios  with the exception of the health benefits ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenues 
premium revenue investment income total revenues health benefits selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income the health benefits ratio is shown as a percentage of premium revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium received and the health benefits provided

our selling  general and administrative expense ratio to revenue was for both the years ended december  and interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase primarily relates to increased average borrowings under our revolving credit facility to partially finance the php acquisition

on october   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  including an over allotment issuance of  shares 
net proceeds from the offering  after fees and expenses  were approximately million 
on october   we used million of proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding balance under our credit facility 
cash flows from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash from operations is primarily due to the impact of an early receipt of premium revenue received in attributable to operations in and increases in depreciation and amortization expense 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an escrow deposit made in connection with the acquisition of php and related costs of million in we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the weighted average maturity is less than six months 
we utilize investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  commercial paper  us government backed agencies  auction rate securities and us treasury instruments

table of contents on october   we entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  wachovia bank  national association  credit suisse first boston and cibc world markets corp 
the credit agreement contains a provision which allows us to obtain  subject to certain conditions  an increase in revolving commitments of up to an additional million 
the proceeds of the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  permitted acquisitions of businesses  assets and technologies 
the borrowings under the credit agreement will accrue interest at one of the following rates  at our option eurodollar plus the applicable margin or an alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for eurodollar borrowings is between and and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings is between and 
the applicable margin will vary depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement is secured by the assets of amerigroup corporation and by the commons stock of its direct  wholly owned subsidiaries 
there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement that ranges from to  depending on the leverage ratio 
the credit agreement terminates on october  our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum statutory capital requirements prescribed by various jurisdictions  including the departments of insurance in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements for the next twelve months 
we believe that internally generated funds and available funds under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months

under certain contracts  we are committed to spend approximately million on software licensing and implementation expenses for our new claims payment system and leasehold improvements relating to a new building under construction in virginia beach  virginia that we will begin leasing in lease guarantee 
in connection with our acquisition of php  we agreed to guarantee a certain lease for office space operated by the former management of php 
the lease term ends in march regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos and one managed care organization  or mco 
hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  state regulatory agencies may require individual hmo s to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries are in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of approximately million 
the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted rules which  to the extent that they are implemented by the states  set new minimum net worth requirements for insurance companies  hmos and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
the change in rules for insurance companies became effective as of december  illinois  texas and the district of columbia adopted various forms of the rules as of december   and  respectively 
since our maryland subsidiary is licensed in both the district of columbia and maryland  the highest risk based capital requirement between the two will prevail 
new jersey and florida have not yet adopted risk based capital as their net worth requirements 
the naic s hmo rules  if adopted by these states in their proposed form  may increase the minimum capital required for our subsidiaries 
effective december   these plans are required to maintain a statutory capital level greater than the state regulations 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost increases 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements include future minimum rental commitments of million and a lease guarantee of million  both of which are disclosed in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships 
compliance costs the federal regulations promulgated under hipaa relating to privacy  standard transactions and security were issued in proposed form in we met the compliance date of april for privacy rules and must comply by october  for transactions and april for security 
the final security rule was issued in february and we have not fully assessed the cost of complying with these regulations 
the fact that either state or federal rules may supersede the other  depending on the nature of the particular requirement  will require interpretations for which there is likely to be little precedent 
we have implemented the programs and systems that were required for compliance with the new privacy regulations by april and continue work for transactions and security compliance 
in order to comply with the requirements  we will have to employ additional or different programs and systems 
we had expenses of approximately million on hipaa compliance in for  we had expenses of approximately million on hipaa compliance 
additional costs will be incurred in in complying with the security regulations which require compliance by april we are in the process of interpreting the security regulations and cannot estimate the cost of compliance at this time 
we expect to be fully compliant by the required dates 
further  compliance with these regulations are requiring changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  we had short term investments of million  long term investments of million and investments on deposit for licensure of million 
these investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities between three and twenty four months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
credit risk is managed by investing in money market funds  us treasury securities  cash escrow accounts  asset backed securities  debt securities of government sponsored entities  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
our investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and our cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
we have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
as of december   a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change in our annual investment income 

table of contents risk factors risks related to being a regulated entity changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders 
changes in existing laws and rules  the enactment of new laws and rules and changing interpretations of these laws and rules could  among other things force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health benefits and administrative costs  impose additional capital requirements  and increase or change our liability 
for example  in texas  our health care operations may be affected by laws passed in the texas legislative session  as well as new regulations adopted by the texas department of insurance  which became effective in october the new laws include a requirement that premium and maintenance taxes apply to medicaid and schip programs  new disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures  more stringent prompt pay requirements that may become applicable to medicaid and schip programs  new requirements for establishing a special investigative unit to investigate fraudulent claims  and new requirements for monitoring and supervising the activities of provider groups 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends  distributions or administrative fees by our subsidiaries to us  it could negatively affect our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
we also have administrative services agreements with our subsidiaries in which we agree to provide them with services and benefits both tangible and intangible in exchange for the payment of a fee 
if the regulators were to deny our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us or restrict or disallow the payment of the administrative fee  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
regulations could limit our profits as a percentage of revenues 
our new jersey and maryland subsidiaries are subject to minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenue 
in new jersey  contractual sanctions may be imposed if these levels are not met 
in addition  our texas plans are required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels 
these regulatory requirements  changes in these requirements and additional requirements by our other regulators could limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues  which could harm our operating results 
we have been required  and may in the future be required  to make payments to the states as a result of not meeting these expense and profit levels 

table of contents our failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties and limitations on our profitability 
violation of the laws or regulations governing our operations could result in the imposition of sanctions  the cancellation of our contracts to provide services  or in the extreme case  the suspension or revocation of our licenses 
for example  in two markets in which we operate we are required to spend a minimum percentage of our premium revenue on medical expenses 
in one market  if we fail to comply with this requirement  we could be required to pay monetary damages 
additionally  we could be required to file a corrective plan of action with the state and we could be subject to further fines and additional corrective measures if we did not comply with the corrective plan of action 
in the other market  our failure to comply could affect future rate determinations 
these regulations could limit the profits we can obtain 
while we have not been subject to any fines or violations that were material  we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to material fines or other sanctions in the future 
if we became subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions were imposed upon us  our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in the past we have been subject to sanctions as a result of violations of marketing regulations and timeliness of the payment requirements 
for example  in august  our illinois plan received a sanction for violations of marketing rules 
in  our florida plan was fined for marketing violations that occurred prior to and shortly after the acquisition of php holdings  inc and its subsidiary  physician healthcare plans  inc  together php 
in new jersey  from time to time  we are fined for failing to meet the timeliness of payment requirements 
additionally  in july  our new jersey subsidiary received a notice of deficiency for failure to maintain provider network requirements in one new jersey county as required by our medicaid contract with new jersey 
we submitted to the state a corrective action plan and a request for a waiver of certain contractual provisions on august  on october   the state of new jersey denied our request for a waiver  but granted an extension until november  to correct the network deficiency 
prior to the expiration of this extension  amerigroup requested and received an additional extension to january  at which time amerigroup requested a waiver to certain network requirements 
amerigroup is awaiting a determination by the state of new jersey on its requested waiver 
there can be no assurances that such a waiver will be granted 
on october   we responded to a civil investigative demand  or cid  of the hmo industry by the office of the attorney general of the state of texas relating to processing of provider claims 
we understand from the office of the attorney general that responses were required from the nine largest hmos in texas  of which we are the ninth 
the other eight are hmos that primarily provide commercial products 
the cid is being conducted in connection with allegations of unfair contracting  delegating and payment practices and violations of the texas deceptive trade practices consumer protection act and article of the texas insurance code by hmos 
in meetings with representatives of the attorney general  they agreed that our required response would be limited to providing information relating to our payment of hospital claims only 
in addition  based upon our discussions with the office of the attorney general  it is our understanding that we are not currently the target of any investigation by that office 
on october  we filed our response to the cid including all information that we believed was required to be produced 
on october   we received a request from the office of the attorney general that we clarify and supplement certain of our responses 
we responded with a second filing on december  and supplemental filings thereafter 
these additional filings were materials provided for clarification of the original submission and were not the result of an expansion of the scope of the cid 
the office of the attorney general could request additional information or clarification that could be costly and time consuming for us to produce 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to health care companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa establishes new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including a whistle blower program 
further  a new regulation promulgated pursuant to hipaa imposes civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with the health records privacy standards set forth in the regulation 
the department of health and human services  or hhs  press release related to the new regulation calls on congress to enact legislation to fortify penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa 

table of contents although no such penalties or private cause of action have yet been created  we do not know when or if such sanctions may be enacted 
hhs also issued its interim fiscal rule on enforcement of the privacy regulations in april enforcement of the privacy regulations is handled under the office of civil rights 
the federal government has enacted  and state governments are enacting  other fraud and abuse laws as well 
our failure to comply with hipaa or these other laws could result in criminal or civil penalties and exclusion from medicaid or other governmental health care programs and could lead to the revocation of our licenses 
these penalties or exclusions  were they to occur  would negatively impact our ability to operate our business 
compliance with new federal and state rules and regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures 
in august  hhs issued a new regulation under hipaa requiring the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
we and the other health organizations that filed a written compliance plan by october were required to comply with the new transactions regulation by october  in july  cms issued its guidance on the october compliance deadline for the hipaa transactions and code set rules  stating that enforcement by cms will be on a complaint driven basis 
also in august  hhs proposed a regulation that would require health care participants to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
this security regulation  finalized in february  requires compliance by april in december  hhs issued a new regulation mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality protections under hipaa  which became effective on april  and which required full compliance on or before april  to the extent that state laws impose stricter privacy standards than the hipaa privacy regulations or to the extent that a state seeks and receives an exception from hhs regarding certain state laws  such laws will not be preempted 
the states ability to promulgate stricter rules regarding privacy and uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult 
our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with these new regulations 
we have implemented the programs and systems that are required for compliance with the new privacy regulations 
in order to comply with the regulatory requirements  we were required to employ additional or different programs and systems 
we had expenditures of approximately million and million on hipaa compliance in and  respectively 
additional costs may be incurred in in complying with the security regulations which require compliance by april and with the transaction standards regulations  which are currently being implemented in accordance with our contingency plans 
we are in the process of interpreting the security regulations and cannot estimate the cost of compliance at this time 
we expect to be fully compliant by the required dates 
further  compliance with these pervasive regulations will require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states 
the new regulations and related costs to comply with the new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  failure to comply with the new regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
in january  cms published new federal regulations regarding medicaid managed care 
on june   cms published final regulations that replaced the january regulations in their entirety 
the final regulations implement requirements of the balanced budget act of that are intended to give states more flexibility in their administration of medicaid managed care programs  provide certain new patient protections for medicaid managed care enrollees  and require states rates to meet new actuarial soundness requirements 
the effective date for compliance with the regulation was august   with an extension provided to states operating under an demonstration waiver with a three year bba extension 
if states fail to comply with the new regulations they could lose their funding from the federal fund matching program 
the new regulations have been reflected in amendments in our contracts or new contracts with the medicaid agencies in our various markets  with the exception of the maryland market which currently operates under the demonstration waiver with the bba extension 
compliance with these new provisions have required changes to many of the 
table of contents procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
changes in health care laws could reduce our profitability 
numerous proposals relating to changes in health care law have been introduced  some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business 
although some of the recent changes in government regulations  such as the removal of the requirements on the enrollment mix between commercial and public sector membership  have encouraged managed care participation in public sector programs  we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will continue to favor or hinder the growth of managed health care 
an example is state and federal legislation that would enable physicians to collectively bargain with managed health care organizations 
the legislation  as currently proposed  generally contains an exemption for public sector managed health care organizations 
if legislation of this type were passed without this exemption  it would negatively impact our bargaining position with many of our providers and might result in an increase in our cost of providing medical benefits 
we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the effect which they might have on us 
legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements could seriously harm our operations and financial results 
changes in federal funding mechanisms could reduce our profitability 
as part of the current administration s budget submission to congress  hhs announced principles for medicaid reform 
hhs s proposal would have established two capped allotments for the states combining both medicaid and schip funds  one for acute care and one for long term care 
under this proposal  all mandatory populations and benefits would continue to be covered as required under current law 
states  however  would be given flexibility for optional populations and benefits 
the proposal would be revenue neutral over a ten year period  although states would receive an additional billion over the first seven years  with corresponding funding reductions in years eight through ten 
the proposal was meant to provide increased flexibility to the states in managing their medicaid and schip programs  in particular in the design of benefit packages for optional populations 
governors working in concert with hhs were unable to reach agreement on these principles and the proposal was set aside for the time being 
it is uncertain as to when  if at all  this proposal  or a variation thereof  will be enacted 
congress instead passed a billion fiscal relief program for the states  which included a billion increase in the share of medical assistance expenditures under each state s medicaid program  known as fmap 
if hhs s proposal is ultimately adopted and the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip decreases in the states in which we operate or the volume of health care services provided is reduced  our growth  operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 
reductions in medicaid funding by the states could substantially reduce our profitability 
most of our revenues come from state government medicaid premiums 
the base premium rate paid by each state differs  depending on a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility categories 
future levels of medicaid premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 
changes to medicaid programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
we believe that additional reductions in medicaid payments could substantially reduce our profitability 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state 
table of contents in the event of unavailability of state funds 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
state governments generally are experiencing budgetary shortfalls 
budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in limited increases or even decreases in the premiums paid to us by the states 
the state of illinois  which accounts for approximately of our total enrollment as of december   reduced the medicaid premiums it pays to us by approximately in and in  due to state budgetary concerns 
if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us  or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
if state governments do not renew our contracts with them on favorable terms  our business will suffer 
as of december   we served members who received health care benefits through contracts with the regulatory entities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
five of these contracts  which are with the states of texas  florida  maryland and new jersey individually accounted for or more of our revenues for the year ended december   with the largest of these contracts representing approximately of our revenues 
if any of our contracts were not renewed on favorable terms or were terminated for cause or if we were to lose a contract in a re bidding process  our business would suffer 
all our contracts have been extended until at least mid termination or non renewal of any single contract could materially impact our revenues and operating results 
some of our contracts are subject to a re bidding process 
for example  we are subject to a re bidding process in each of our three texas markets and for our schip contracts in each of our three florida markets 
our texas markets are re bid every six years and the re bidding process is scheduled to occur in in florida  six of eight counties currently under contract were re bid in april our re bid resulted in the retention of four current counties and our selection as a new carrier in two additional counties 
the florida schip contracts are re bid every two or four years 
if we lost a contract through the re bidding process  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease 
states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state s application for renewal  our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 
we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the state government 
inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 
premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by the state government 
from time to time  states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
alternatively  a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 
if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 
our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos and one managed care organization  or mco 
hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state 
additionally  state regulatory agencies may require  at their discretion  individual hmo s to maintain statutory capital levels higher 
table of contents than the state regulations 
if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries  we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary 
any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 
risks related to our business receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively impact our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract period to facilitate access to health care services as established by the state governments 
we have less control over costs related to the provision of health care than we do over our selling  general and administrative expenses 
historically  our expenses related to health benefits as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated 
for example  our expenses related to health benefits were of our premium revenue in  and of our premium revenue in if premiums are not increased and expenses related to health benefits rise  our earnings could be impacted negatively 
in addition  our actual health benefits costs may exceed our estimated costs 
the premiums we receive under our current contracts may therefore be inadequate to cover all claims  which could cause our profits to decline 
maryland sets the rates that must be paid to hospitals by all payors 
it is possible for the state to increase rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
if this were to occur  or if other states were to take similar actions  our profitability would be harmed 
premiums are contractually payable to us before or during the month for services that we are obligated to provide to our members 
our cash flow would be negatively impacted if premium payments are not made according to contract terms 
our inability to manage medical costs effectively would reduce our profitability 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
changes in health care regulations and practices  level of use of health care services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of health care services 
although we have been able to manage medical costs through a variety of techniques  including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  medical management and quality management programs  our information systems and reinsurance arrangements  we may not be able to continue to manage costs effectively in the future 
it is possible that claims previously denied and claims previously paid to non network providers will be appealed and subsequently reprocessed at different amounts 
this would result in an adjustment to claims expense 
if our costs for medical services increase  our profits could be reduced  or we may not remain profitable 
our limited ability to predict our incurred medical expenses accurately could negatively impact our reported results 
our medical expenses include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
we estimate our ibnr medical expenses based on a number of factors  including authorization data  prior claims experience  maturity of markets  complexity and mix of products and stability of provider networks 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change 
we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted on a regular basis to calculate and review the adequacy of our medical liabilities  in addition to using our internal resources 
we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to such ibnr estimates will not harm our results of operations 
further  our inability to accurately estimate ibnr may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further exacerbating the extent of the harm on our results 

table of contents we maintain reinsurance to protect us against severe or catastrophic medical claims  but we cannot assure you that such reinsurance coverage will be adequate or available to us in the future or that the cost of such reinsurance will not limit our ability to obtain it 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy or integrating acquired business could adversely affect our business 
historically  acquisitions including the acquisition of medicaid contract rights and related assets of other health plans  both in our existing service areas and in new markets  has accounted for a significant amount of our growth 
although we cannot predict our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions with complete accuracy  we believe that acquisitions similar in nature to those we have historically executed will be important to our growth strategy 
many of the other potential purchasers of these assets have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  many of the sellers are interested in either selling  along with their medicaid assets  other assets in which we do not have an interest  or selling their companies  including their liabilities  as opposed to just the assets of the ongoing business 
therefore  we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us or that we can obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions 
we are currently evaluating potential acquisitions that would increase our membership  as well as acquisitions of complementary health care service businesses 
these potential acquisitions are at various stages of consideration and discussion and we may enter into letters of intent or other agreements relating to these proposals at any time 
however  we cannot predict when or whether we will actually acquire these businesses 
we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we will be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if  as a result of the acquisition  we will operate in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
our existing credit facility imposes certain restrictions on acquisitions 
we may not be able to meet these restrictions 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations 
this may include the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations  existing provider networks  which may operate on different terms than our existing networks  existing members  who may decide to switch to another health care provider  and disparate information and record keeping systems 
we may be unable to successfully identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions  including integrating the acquired businesses on to our technology platform  or to implement our operations strategy in order to operate acquired businesses profitably 
we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that incurring expenses to acquire a business will result in the acquisition being consummated 
these expenses could impact our selling  general and administrative expense ratio 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired businesses  our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 
failure of a new business would negatively impact our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to be able to obtain a state contract and process claims 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license  winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to 
table of contents cover our costs  the new business would fail 
we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start up costs 
the loss of the costs associated with starting up the business could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
ineffective management of rapid growth or our inability to grow could negatively affect our results of operations  financial condition and business 
we have experienced rapid growth 
in  our first full year of operations  we had million of premium revenue 
in  we had  million in premium revenue 
this increase represents a compound annual growth rate of 
depending on acquisition and other opportunities  we expect to continue to grow rapidly 
continued growth could place a significant strain on our management and on other resources 
we anticipate that continued growth  if any  will require us to continue to recruit  hire  train and retain a substantial number of new and highly skilled medical  administrative  information technology  finance and other support personnel 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
if we continue to experience rapid growth  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our operations  and our management may fail to anticipate adequately all demands that growth will place on our resources 
in addition  due to the initial costs incurred upon the acquisition of new businesses  rapid growth could adversely affect our short term profitability 
our inability to manage growth effectively or our inability to grow could have a negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to competition that impacts our ability to increase our penetration of the markets that we service 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we compete with numerous types of competitors  including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
some of the health plans with which we compete have substantially larger enrollments  greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do 
while many states mandate health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants  the programs are voluntary in other states  such as illinois 
subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications  the federal government requires that there be choice for medicaid recipients among managed care programs 
voluntary programs and mandated competition will impact our ability to increase our market share 
in addition  in most states in which we operate we are not allowed to market directly to potential members  and therefore  we rely on creating name brand recognition through our community based programs 
where we have only recently entered a market or compete with health plans much larger than we are  we may be at a competitive disadvantage unless and until our community based programs and other promotional activities create brand awareness 
restrictions and covenants in our credit facility could limit our ability to take actions 
on october   we entered into a new million amended and restated credit agreement with four lenders 
the credit facility contains a provision which allows us to obtain  subject to certain conditions  an increase in revolving commitments of up to an additional million 
our credit agreement is secured by the assets of amerigroup and by the common stock of its direct  wholly owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we must meet certain financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
these financial covenants include meeting certain financial ratios  a limit on annual capital expenditures  and a minimum net worth requirement 
as of december   the credit facility was undrawn 
events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in the competitive environment  could impair our operating performance  which could affect our ability to comply with the terms of 
table of contents the credit facility 
breaching any of the covenants or restrictions could result in the unavailability of the facility or a default under the credit facility 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility or that we would be able to restructure such indebtedness on terms favorable to us 
if we were unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under the credit facility  the lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness 
the loss of the services of our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer would harm our operations  our inability to find a suitable replacement for our chief financial officer could negatively impact our business 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of mr 
jeffrey mcwaters  our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
mr 
mcwaters  as our founder  has been instrumental in developing our mission and forging our relationships with our government client customers and the communities we serve 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain mr 
mcwaters or attract a suitable replacement or additional personnel if required 
we have an employment agreement with mr 
mcwaters that continues from year to year unless terminated by either party on days written notice 
we cannot be sure that the employment agreement creates sufficient incentives for mr 
mcwaters to continue his employment with us 
while we believe that we could find a replacement for mr 
mcwaters if he were to leave  the loss of his services could harm our operations 
our chief financial officer resigned effective october  although we intend to hire a new chief financial officer  doing so might be difficult or take an extended period of time  which could negatively impact our business 
our inability to maintain satisfactory relationships with providers would harm our profitability 
our profitability depends  in large part  upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians and specialists usually are for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year terms  subject to termination by us for cause based on provider conduct or other appropriate reasons 
the contracts generally may be canceled by either party upon to days prior written notice 
our contracts with hospitals are usually for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year periods  subject to termination for cause due to provider misconduct or other appropriate reasons 
generally  our hospital contracts may be canceled by either party without cause on to days prior written notice 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
although we have established long term relationships with many of our providers  we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability will be harmed 
on occasion  our members obtain care from providers that are not in our network and with which we do not have contracts 
to the extent that we know of such instances  we attempt to redirect their care to a network provider 
we have generally reimbursed non network providers at the rates paid to comparable network providers or at the applicable rate that the provider could have received under the traditional fee for service medicaid program or at a discount therefrom 
in some instances  we pay non network providers pursuant to the terms of our contracts with the state 
however  some non network providers have requested that we pay them at their highest billing rate  or full billed charges 
full billed charges are significantly more than the amount the non network providers could otherwise receive under the traditional fee for service medicaid program 
additionally  some non network providers in new jersey and texas have filed lawsuits seeking reimbursements of full billed charges from us for services they provided to our members 
the texas trial court ruled in november to abate the lawsuit brought by out of network providers pending the providers exhaustion of administrative remedies with hhsc 
to our knowledge tch has not initiated an administrative complaint in accordance with the court s order 
however  in march we received notice that hhsc had commenced a review of certain claims payment issues raised by tch in early  which are part of the subject matter of the lawsuit 

table of contents on august   the court ruled against our new jersey subsidiary 
although no amount of damages has been determined thus far  a notice of motion for summary judgment on damages was filed on september   seeking approximately million 
the court denied the motion on december  we have petitioned the appeals court for move to file an interlocutory appeal of the superior court s summary judgement on the issue of liability 
the petition is currently pending before the appellate division 
on february   the court adjourned the march  trial on the issue of damages 
to the extent that non network providers are successful in obtaining payment at rates in excess of the rates that we have historically paid to non network providers  our profitability could be materially adversely affected 
see business legal proceedings 
we are dependent on our relationship with cook children s physician network 
any material modification or discontinuation of this relationship could harm our results of operations 
cook children s physician network is our exclusive provider network for pediatric services in fort worth  where we had approximately  members as of december  if the terms of our contract with cook children s physician network were to change significantly or cook children s physician network was to terminate its agreement with us  our costs to provide health care in this area could increase 
we could lose members if cook children s physician network chose to associate with another hmo or if it obtained its own contract with the state to provide health care services to medicaid recipients 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 
in the past  the managed care industry has received negative publicity 
this publicity has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services  require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate  further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results 
we may be subject to claims relating to medical malpractice  which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
in addition  some states are considering legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
in addition  we may be subject to other litigation that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance and such other lines of coverage as we believe is reasonable in light of our experience to date 
however  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liabilities that might adversely affect our business or results of operations 
even if any claims brought against us were unsuccessful or without merit  we would still have to defend ourselves against such claims 
any such defenses may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
changes in the number of medicaid eligibles  or benefits provided to medicaid eligibles or a change in mix of medicaid eligibles could cause our operating results to suffer 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
however  during such economic downturns  state budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut health care programs  benefits and rates 
if this were to happen while our membership was increasing  our results of operations could suffer 
conversely  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve  thereby causing our operating results to suffer 
in either case  in the 
table of contents event that the company experiences a change in product mix to less profitable product lines  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
changes in schip rules restricting eligibility could cause our operating results to suffer 
the states in which we operate have experienced budget deficits 
in florida  texas and maryland  the rules governing schip have either recently changed  or will likely change in the near future  to restrict or limit eligibility for benefits through the imposition of waiting periods  enrollment caps and or new or increased co payments 
these changes in schip eligibility could cause us to experience a net loss in schip membership 
if the states in which we operate continue to restrict or limit schip eligibility  our operating results could suffer 
our inability to integrate  manage and grow our information systems effectively could disrupt our operations 
our operations are significantly dependent on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status and other information 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we are continually upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
we estimate that our current claims payment system could be at full capacity within the next months 
accordingly  on november   we announced that we signed a software licensing agreement with the trizetto group  inc for the facets extended enterprise tm administrative system 
we currently expect that the facets software will meet our needs for approximately the next ten years and support our long term growth strategies 
we currently estimate implementation of the new system by the end of however  if we cannot execute a successful system conversion  our operations could be disrupted  which would have a negative impact on our profitability and our ability to grow could be harmed 
acts of terrorism could cause our business to suffer 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
if acts of terrorism were to occur in markets in which we operate  our business could suffer 
the results of terrorist acts could lead to higher than expected medical costs  network and information technology disruptions  and other related factors beyond our control  which would cause our business to suffer
