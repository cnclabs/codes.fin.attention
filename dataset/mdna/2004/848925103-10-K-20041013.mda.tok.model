sport haley must continue to successfully anticipate fashion trends  design apparel that is accepted by consumers as fashionable and stylish and maintain an adequate product mix thereof in order to continue to have market acceptance 
sport haley s sales are seasonal  and historically sales from july through december  sport haley s first and second fiscal quarters  are weaker than sales from january through june  which are sport haley s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the market for golf apparel is extremely competitive  price competition or industry consolidation could weaken sport haley s competitive position 
in order to maintain its competitive position  sport haley must effectively advertise and communicate within the marketplace and successfully penetrate the company s chosen distribution channels 
sport haley maintains a significant level of finished goods inventories to support its sales volume and its corporate apparel program 
disposal of excess prior seasons inventories at reduced margins is an inherent characteristic within the golf apparel industry  but a significant amount of sales at the lower margins dictated by the liquidation of excess inventories may impair the company s financial condition 
write downs with regard to obsolete inventories may also continue to adversely affect sport haley s financial condition 
sport haley depends on timely delivery of finished garments from its suppliers 
the loss of certain suppliers  and or delays in receiving garments from suppliers caused by various factors  including lost or reduced manufacturing capacity of significant suppliers  labor shortages  timely performance of third parties  and transportation difficulties  could adversely affect sport haley s ability to make timely delivery of finished garments to its customers 
sport haley s reliance on foreign suppliers enhances the risk that revenues might be adversely affected if a foreign shipment were lost or significantly delayed 
the company maintains insurance for risk of loss including those relating to raw materials inventories shipped between foreign vendors and finished goods inventories shipped from its foreign suppliers to its distribution facilities in denver  colorado 
however  significant reliance on foreign suppliers heightens the risk that sport haley would be left with inadequate or unsatisfactory recourse should the goods received from the foreign suppliers be nonconforming 
sport haley s reliance on foreign suppliers sustains the risk that revenues might be adversely affected by changes in international trade quota systems for apparel or by a deterioration in political and international trade relations between the united states of america and the foreign countries where the suppliers are located 
sport haley purchases significant amounts of its finished apparel from four separate foreign suppliers 
if the company were to lose or terminate the services of any of these significant suppliers  the company s short term ability to fulfill its customers orders on a timely basis could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting sport haley s results of operations 
sport haley maintains a close working relationship with a certain foreign person who is responsible for maintaining relationships with and monitoring the performance of certain of the company s foreign suppliers 
if the company were to lose or terminate the services of this individual  the company s short term ability to fulfill its customers orders on a timely basis could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting sport haley s results of operations 
sport haley s reliance on foreign suppliers requires the company to maintain satisfactory relationships with commercial banking institutions in order to have adequate access to capital to finance inventory purchases from the foreign suppliers via import letters of credit 
an ever increasing percentage of sport haley s net sales are derived from sales related to the licensing agreement with callaway to market and distribute ben hogan apparel

the increased threats of terrorist activities in the united states  the conflict in iraq and other international conflicts appear to have adversely affected sport haley s sales 
business trends of the golf apparel industry closely follow trends in the travel and leisure sectors of the united states economy 
international conflicts and other geopolitical conditions resulting from threats or acts of war or terrorism and responses thereto continued to stifle the travel and leisure sectors that had already been negatively impacted by the general economic downturn experienced during previous years 
the company s sales could decrease if the usa economy weakens further 
the company may experience an increase in the number and magnitude of delinquent or uncollectible customer accounts during periods of economic downturn 
businesses in general are ever increasingly dependent upon computer information systems 
the company must continually establish and sustain controls with regard to maintaining the integrity of its technology and information systems in order to adequately manage business activities and control costs and expenses 
on a limited basis  the company maintains agreements with certain of its independent wholesale sales representatives whereby sport haley guarantees the sales representatives certain set amounts of monthly sales commissions 
the financial results of the company may be adversely affected should the sales representatives not generate wholesale sales sufficient to justify the amounts of commissions paid under the guarantee agreements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  which require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on k 
the estimates used by management are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
inventories  predominately comprised of finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
excess finished goods inventories are a natural component of a seasonal apparel business 
while certain finished goods items will sell out in any particular selling season  quantities of other finished goods items will remain at the end of each selling season 
the company markets previous seasons finished goods inventories at reduced wholesale prices to its customers in the normal course of business 
remaining excess inventories are liquidated through other markets 
excess finished goods inventories may have more of an adverse effect on the results of sport haley s operations than realized by other companies within the golf apparel industry 
while the golf apparel market in total is generally comprised of men s apparel and women s apparel  sport haley s sales for fiscal were generally comprised of men s apparel and women s apparel 
the company s excess inventories are primarily comprised of women s apparel  which has a much smaller distribution market than for men s apparel 
the company performs an analysis on a quarterly basis to identify unsold discontinued or aging merchandise and adjusts its inventory valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of discontinued or aging merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
the net realizable value of the discontinued or aging merchandise is estimated based on management s disposition plans and historical experiences 
in the ordinary course of business  the company maintains reserves for inventory write downs due to the obsolescence of discontinued or aging merchandise 
during fiscal  the company recorded finished goods inventories write downs of  including a write down of  during the fourth fiscal quarter 
while management believes that the company s processes produce a fair valuation of obsolete inventories  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances may be required 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
sport haley s significant deferred tax assets are related to net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes  a change in accounting methods for federal income tax purposes  stock options compensation and an unrealized loss for tax purposes on a common stock investment 
state income tax regulations require that sport haley s operating losses be carried forward for state income tax purposes 
sport haley has established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
the estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require management to exercise complex judgments 
management periodically reviews and adjusts those estimates based upon the most current information available 
because of the company s trend of net losses in the current and most recent prior years  management believes that it is more probable than not that none of the company s net deferred tax assets will be recovered 
therefore  the company increased its valuation allowance at june   to effectively reduce its net deferred tax assets to zero 
however  because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from management s estimates 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires management to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating the reserve for uncollectible accounts  management considers factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
analyses performed by management throughout fiscal indicated an increase in the percentage of doubtful accounts 
therefore  the company s increased its allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
from time to time  management also identifies delinquent customer accounts for which a specific reserve is required 
at june   the company had established specific reserves approximating  with respect to two separate delinquent customer accounts 
at june   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  while management considers the company s processes to be adequate to effectively quantify its exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may result in a recoverability of sport haley s doubtful accounts that differs materially from management s estimates 
sport haley records its allowance for sales returns as a net adjustment to customer accounts receivable 
when recording an allowance  the net method reduces customer accounts receivable and net sales by the estimated gross margin effect of the anticipated sales return 
generally  the company s selling terms preclude return of its products subsequent to the sale 
however  the company has traditionally maintained limited programs that offer some customers the right to return certain finished goods items under predefined conditions  and the percentage of sport haley s customers that refuse receipt of merchandise at the time of delivery has continued to increase 
management reviews historical data and considers factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions and anticipated customer performance when evaluating the company s allowance for sales returns 
because of an increasing percentage of sales returns  the company increased its allowance for sales returns by  during the fiscal quarter ended june  at june   the company s allowance for sales returns was approximately  beginning with the fall selling season  the company began offering its independent wholesale sales representatives the right to return sample garments to the company at no charge to the sales representative 
previously  the company invoiced the sales representatives for sample garments at discounted wholesale prices 
because of the right of return offered to the sales representatives with regard to sample garments  the company elected to record invoiced sales of sample garments to sales representatives in a manner consistent with consigned inventories 
therefore  beginning with the fall selling season  the company includes the cost of sample garments in finished goods inventories as consigned inventories and records an allowance to completely offset the revenue effect of the sale of sample garments 
the sales representative s accounts receivable balance  the related allowance for sales representative samples and the related inventory costs are adjusted when either the sales representative reimburses the company for the cost of sample garments or the garments are returned to the company 
at june   the company s allowance for returns of sales representatives sample garments was approximately  significant changes in general economic or industry conditions may yield sales returns that differ materially from management s estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from sport haley s statements of income for its fiscal years ended june   and  and fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of fixed assets income loss from operations other income and expenses  net income loss from operations before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were approximately  and increase of approximately  or  as compared with  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a continued increase in the sales of ben hogan apparel combined with a continued decline in the sales of haley apparel 
the increase in ben hogan apparel sales exhibits growth the company has achieved within the premium price market for such apparel and is indicative of management s effective strategies to maximize revenues associated with the callaway licensing agreement 
the continued decline in sales of haley apparel greatly concerns the management of sport haley 
management believes that the generally flat united states economy throughout fiscal contributed greatly to the depressed sales of haley apparel 
the sluggish economic conditions have especially adversely affected sales of women s golf apparel throughout fiscal since women s apparel comprises a predominant portion of haley apparel sales  sport haley may have been more significantly affected by the sluggish economic conditions than other competitors within the golf apparel industry 
while the golf apparel market is basically comprised of men s apparel and women s apparel  historically  sales of haley apparel have typically been comprised of men s apparel and women s apparel 
sales of haley men s apparel have been steadily declining for several years and were considerably less in fiscal than in previous years 
recently  management has spoken with a few long time customers that have indicated they are now placing less of an importance on stocking women s golf apparel collections 
therefore  the company expects that the trend of increasing sales of ben hogan apparel and declining sales of haley apparel may continue into the foreseeable future 
the company believes that there are natural synergies common to ben hogan men s apparel and haley women s apparel 
thus  during fiscal  management continued to consolidate its independent wholesale sales forces  and approximately of its independent sales representatives now market both brands 
by marketing ben hogan men s apparel in conjunction with haley women s apparel  the company is attempting to maintain its market share with current women s apparel customers and to expand the distribution channels for women s apparel into markets that the company had previously only been able to penetrate via the marketing of ben hogan men s apparel 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the retail factory outlet store  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the continued build up of excess and obsolete finished goods inventories during fiscal while excess and obsolete inventories are common within any apparel business  maintaining a minimum level of such inventories is a critical factor to the success an apparel business 
obsolete inventories are an especially critical factor to the success of sport haley  because a significant portion of the company s inventories is comprised of women s apparel 
while obsolete men s golf apparel may be disposed of through several different outlets  market options available for the disposal of women s golf apparel are very limited 
therefore  the company s obsolete women s inventories are much more sensitive to devaluation than are its men s inventories 
the company s management performs quarterly analyses of its obsolete inventories and adjusts its reserve for inventory obsolescence to reduce the carrying value of obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
adjustments to the inventory valuation allowance are included as a component of the company s cost of goods sold 
an increase in obsolete inventories in fiscal affected cost of goods sold by  while a decrease in obsolete inventories in fiscal affected cost of goods sold by  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of  from in fiscal the margin erosion in fiscal is primarily attributable to the effects of the company s build up in excess and obsolete finished goods inventories 
the company s management is extremely concerned about the continued build up 
in april  the company s chief executive officer spearheaded an extensive evaluation of the company s processes used for merchandise planning  product forecasting and excess inventory disposal 
the evaluation spawned new inventory reduction initiatives for the disposal of excess inventories that will utilize both current channels of distribution and large discount retail chains 
management expects that the new inventory reduction initiatives and enhancements to the company s software will enable sport haley to significantly reduce the levels of its finished goods inventories throughout fiscal management expects to reduce the company s finished goods inventories to approximately  by december   and to further reduce them to approximately  by june  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately  an increase of  or  as compared with  in fiscal a significant portion of the increase was attributable to operating costs associated with ben hogan apparel 
selling  general and administrative expenses with respect to ben hogan for fiscal were approximately  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal contributing factors included in the increased ben hogan selling  general and administrative costs were higher amount of royalties paid to callaway and commissions paid to independent sales representatives on a corresponding increase in sales of ben hogan apparel  and  other increases in general expenses necessary to support the continued increase sales of ben hogan apparel 
another contributing factor to the total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was an increase in total personnel expenses  a significant portion of which was attributable to severance compensation of  payable to the company s former president upon his termination 
legal defense costs with respect to a securities and exchange commission investigation and civil enforcement action and a class action lawsuit filed against sport haley and certain of its current and former officers and directors continued to contribute to increased selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal such legal costs approximated  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in september  the company received a reimbursement of approximately  from one of its insurance carriers relating to legal costs associated with the securities and exchange commission civil action and class action matters 
the company recorded the  as a receivable at june   and offset fiscal legal expenses by the same amount 
subject to the terms of the applicable insurance policies  the company expects to receive further reimbursements for the costs of defense of the securities and exchange commission action as the company has met the applicable retention amount 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for both fiscal and total other income  net  for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between the fiscal years in the amounts of and the rates of interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during fiscal  interest rates on virtually risk free investments continued at or near all time lows 
the company continues to search for investment alternatives available within the guidelines approved by its board of directors in order to maximize the rates of return achieved on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
income loss from operations before provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal was approximately  a decline of  or  as compared with  in fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately  a decline of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net losses between the fiscal years arose because of the differences in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the proportional disparity in provision for benefit from income taxes between fiscal and fiscal was primarily caused by differences in the valuation of net deferred tax assets 
because of the company s trend of net losses in the current and most recent prior years  management believes that it is more probable than not that none of the company s net deferred tax assets will be recovered 
therefore  the company increased its valuation allowance at june   to effectively reduce its net deferred tax assets to zero 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were approximately  an increase of  or  as compared with  for the fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of ben hogan apparel combined with decreased sales of haley apparel 
the increase in ben hogan apparel sales was indicative of the strong market acceptance of the brand within upscale golf markets 
the increasing percentage of net sales relating to ben hogan apparel was indicative of management s efforts to increase revenues associated with the callaway licensing agreement for such apparel 
however  the increasing relative percentage of sales relating to licensed apparel sustained a risk of loss  should the callaway licensing agreement be terminated by either party 
the continued decline in haley apparel sales was indicative of the intense competitive environment within golf apparel industry that continued throughout fiscal several companies with significantly greater financial resources and better name recognition than sport haley continued to influence their customers to maintain strong business relationships with them in the times of a continued weak united states economy 
because of their status  the big name companies have a competitive advantage over sport haley in a sluggish economy  and they have the ability to maintain a greater relative share of the overall golf apparel business in such times 
during fiscal  management implemented marketing strategies to build a unified network of independent sales representatives to thereby strengthen relationships with its loyal haley and ben hogan customers and to attract new customers to the haley and ben hogan brands 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the retail factory outlet store  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to the introduction of ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at retail outlet stores 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately  an increase of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the increase in gross profit was attributable to a combination of factors 
the increased sales of ben hogan apparel contributed significantly to the increase in gross profit achieved in fiscal  because a significant portion of the ben hogan sales were made at full margin 
the increase in gross profit was also attributable to higher margins earned on haley apparel  primarily due to minimizing the margin erosion relating to sales of obsolete and closeout finished goods inventories at reduced selling prices as discussed below 
the higher gross margins on haley apparel were achieved in part because of the improved controls over the purchasing of finished goods inventories that management implemented in fiscal to minimize the level of finished goods inventories remaining at the end of a selling season 
during fiscal  sport haley evolved from a company that manufactured its finished goods inventories into a company that primarily purchases its inventories from foreign suppliers 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  an increase of  from in fiscal management attributed the increase in gross margin to the increased sales of ben hogan apparel combined with improved margins on the sales of the haley apparel lines 
throughout fiscal  management continued to improve the sourcing for the haley apparel lines in order to achieve higher top line margins 
however  during fiscal  sport haley continued to experience margin erosion with regard to excess and prior seasons component and haley finished goods inventories 
sales of excess and prior seasons inventories at reduced selling prices are common within the golf apparel industry 
because the ben hogan lines were introduced less than two years prior to the end of fiscal  sales of excess and prior seasons inventories caused minimal erosion of gross margins with respect to ben hogan apparel in fiscal during fiscal and  sales of excess and prior season s inventories  ie sales at or near zero margins  were approximately  and  respectively 
write downs of obsolete inventories to liquidation values are also common within the golf apparel business 
in fiscal  sport haley experienced considerable margin erosion due to writing down component and finished goods inventories to liquidation values 
in fiscal  write downs with respect to obsolete component and finished goods inventories caused much less margin erosion than was caused by the same in fiscal in fiscal  sport haley wrote down obsolete component and finished goods inventories by approximately  as compared with write downs of approximately  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately  an increase of  or  as compared with  for fiscal a significant portion of the increase was attributable to operating costs with respect to ben hogan apparel 
selling  general and administrative costs with respect to ben hogan apparel for fiscal were approximately  an increase of  or  as compared with  for fiscal contributing factors included in the increased ben hogan selling  general and administrative costs were higher amount of royalties paid to top flite golf and commissions paid to independent sales representatives on a corresponding increase in sales of ben hogan apparel  increased advertising expenditures  increased salaries due to expanded customer service operations  and  other increases in general expenses necessary to support the increasing sales 
another contributing factor to the total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was an increase in bad debt expense 
in fiscal  sport haley recorded bad debt expenses totaling approximately  with respect to three separate customer accounts 
legal defense costs with respect to a securities and exchange commission investigation of and a class action lawsuit filed against sport haley and certain of its officers and directors continued to contribute to increased selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal such legal costs approximated  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
total other income  net  for fiscal approximated  a decrease of  or  as compared with  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between the fiscal years in the rates in interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the federal reserve bank s actions to strengthen the sluggish usa economy kept interest rates available on virtually risk free investments at or near all time lows during fiscal income loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately  an improvement of  or  as compared with  for fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately  an improvement of  or  as compared with  for fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net losses between the fiscal years arose because of the differences in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the proportional disparity was primarily caused by differences in recording federal net operating loss carry backs in fiscal with regard to the liquidation of the subsidiary 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared with for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are comprised of its available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and a working capital line of credit with a commercial bank 
the company requires cash for its general working capital purposes 
management does not anticipate the requirements of material amounts of cash for capital expenditures over the next months 
to the extent the company s cash balance is insufficient to finance working capital requirements  sport haley may also make periodic borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
the company s working capital requirements are highly seasonal in nature  with greater requirements from approximately august through october and february through april of each fiscal year due to the purchases of finished goods inventories for the spring summer and fall holiday selling seasons  respectively 
working capital was approximately  and  at june  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities totaled approximately  and  at june  and  respectively 
for purposes of the statements of cash flows  sport haley considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present an insignificant risk of change in value due to changes in interest rates  to be cash equivalents 
net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary components of adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities were changes between fiscal years relating to impairments and write downs  deferred taxes  provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes receivable  accounts payable  and accrued commissions and other expenses 
adjustments for impairments and write downs affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by used in operating activities caused by impairments and write downs represent the expense effects of recording impairments and write downs in the respective fiscal years 
because of the seasonal nature of the apparel business  excess inventories left over at the end of each selling season previous seasons inventories are common within the industry 
throughout each fiscal year  sport haley markets previous seasons inventories through its ordinary marketing channels 
at or near the end of each fiscal quarter  management identifies and revalues obsolete inventories to estimated liquidation values 
write down charges relating to excess inventories have adversely affected the company s earnings and cash flows for the last several years 
in fiscal  the company s management enacted initiatives directed to significantly reduce the levels of finished goods inventories in order to minimize the future adverse financial effect associated with the devaluation of obsolete inventories 
the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in deferred taxes and other primarily represent the change in expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts 
the company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
in fiscal  because of the company s trend of net losses in the current and most recent prior years  management believes that it is more probable than not that none of the company s deferred tax assets will be recovered 
therefore  the company increased its valuation allowance at june   to effectively reduce its net deferred tax assets to zero 
deferred taxes affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns primarily represent the net expense effects of the changes in allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns between the respective years 
in fiscal  the company performed a review of its customer accounts receivable 
the analysis revealed an increase in the percentage of doubtful accounts  and management increased its allowance for doubtful accounts 
management also recorded a specific reserve in fiscal of approximately  with respect to two separate accounts for which collection appears highly doubtful 
as of june  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal in addition to a higher estimated percentage of uncollectible accounts  the balance of the company s allowance for doubtful accounts at june  is higher than previous years because of a higher balance of customer accounts receivable at june  when compared with the june balances in prior years 
the higher balance of customer accounts receivable at june  is due  in part  to greater sales revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of than in the same fiscal quarters in previous years  comparatively 
the company s allowances for customer sales returns at june were approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the percentage of sales returns has remained fairly constant for the last three fiscal years 
the increase in the allowance for sales returns in fiscal is primarily due to the increase in customer accounts receivable at june  the company also initiated a reserve for the return of samples garments from the company s independent wholesale sales representatives pursuant to a procedural change with regard to such sample garments effective with the fall selling season 
as of june  the company s allowances for sample garments were approximately  in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal accounts receivable  not including the effects of provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal and provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  the increase in fiscal primarily relates to the comparative increase in net sales between the fourth fiscal quarter of versus the fourth fiscal quarter of inventories  not including the effects of inventory write downs  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal inventories increased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  the increase in inventories  especially finished goods inventories  is a major concern to the company s management 
in fiscal  the company s management enacted initiatives directed to significantly reduce the levels of finished goods inventories in order to minimize the future adverse financial effect associated with excess quantities of finished goods inventories 
income taxes receivable provided operating cash of approximately in fiscal   in fiscal and used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal the income taxes receivable in prior years affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by the amounts recoverable via utilizing federal income tax carrybacks and with cash deposits of income tax refunds received 
the company s losses prior to fiscal exhausted the federal amounts recoverable by utilizing net operating loss carrybacks 
therefore  the company s net tax operating losses generated in fiscal and may only be used to offset future taxable income and have been recorded by the company as a component of its net deferred tax assets  accordingly 
accounts payable provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal accounts payable increased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  changes in accounts payable relate to differences in the timing between the years in the recording and payments of expenditures for inventory purchases  ordinary business expenses and other 
accrued commissions and other expenses provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal accrued commissions and other expenses increased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  the increase primarily relates to higher sales commissions due to the company independent wholesale sales representatives on correspondingly higher sales for the months of june  comparatively between the and fiscal years 
net cash provided by used in investing activities totaled approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the primary components of net cash provided by used in investing activities were maturities purchases of marketable securities and purchases and disposals of fixed assets
