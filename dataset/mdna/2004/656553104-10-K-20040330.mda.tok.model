critical accounting estimates as stated in our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition  inventory reserves  long lived and intangible asset impairment  deferred tax balances  and self insured health claim reserves 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business the company enters into a number of contracts with customers under which we provide engineering services on a per project basis 
revenue for these services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  usually upon initial shipment of the product 
revenues from repair services are recognized upon shipment of related equipment to customers 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or in excess of production needs 
these values are estimates and may differ from actual results 
the company has an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete 
this process is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
long lived and intangible asset impairment the company evaluates long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on the company s projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the asset impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes management s estimate of the tax rates utilized in the calculation of the deferred tax balances is based on historical taxable income and expected future taxable income and corresponding rates 
further  management s consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of taxable income in future periods 
these are estimates and may differ from actual results 
self insured health claim reserves management estimates its reserve for employee health claims based on health claims incurred  historical lag times and an analysis of claims activity during the period  while taking into consideration insurance limits and coverage 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgements and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
exchange rate sensitivity the company conducts operations in mexico 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
the company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiary s local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would have an immaterial impact on reported net earnings 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate on the company s credit facilities are influenced by the actions of the federal reserve in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate which is the rate banks borrow from the federal reserve bank 
during  and  the federal reserve implemented a number of reductions in the federal funds interest rate in an effort to stimulate the us economy 
as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under the facilities declined  leading to a corresponding reduction in interest expense 
to the extent that the federal reserve increases the federal funds interest rate in the future  the effective interest rate on the company s facilities will increase 
the company s interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant 
based on the balance outstanding under our interest bearing facilities at year end  a percentage point change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by approximately  the remainder of this page was intentionally left blank
