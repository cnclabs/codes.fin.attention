we were incorporated in florida in april and changed our name from supreme international corporation to perry ellis international  inc on june  our principal executive offices are located at nw th avenue  miami  florida  and our telephone number is our competitive strengths we believe that our competitive strengths position us to capitalize on several trends that have affected the apparel industry in recent years 
these trends include the consolidation of the department and chain store distribution channels into a smaller number of larger retailers  the increased dependence of retailers on reliable domestic suppliers who have design expertise  advanced systems and technology  and the ability to quickly meet changing consumer tastes  the increased importance of mass merchants in apparel sales  and the continued importance of strong brands as a source of product differentiation

our brands are solidly positioned in retail outlets at all major levels of retail distribution and have increased our exposure nationally and internationally 
we believe that our broad portfolio of brands also appeals to licensees because it gives licensees the opportunity to sell their products into many different distribution channels 
for example  a manufacturer of men s accessories might license the cubavera brand to enter the department store channel or license the munsingwear brand to target the national and regional chain stores 
by licensing our owned brands  we offer consumers a complete product assortment by brand 
we also coordinate our marketing efforts with licensees  thereby maximizing exposure for our brands and our return on investment 
sophisticated global low cost sourcing capabilities 
we have sourced our products globally for more than years and employ sophisticated logistics and supply chain management systems to maintain maximum flexibility 
our network of worldwide sourcing partners enables us to meet our customers needs in an efficient and high quality manner without relying on any one vendor  factory  or country

proven ability to integrate acquisitions

we intend to continue enhancing the recognition of our brands by aggressively marketing our brands to both consumers and retailers 
we have made a strategic decision to focus on branded apparel and to reduce our private label business 
as a result of this shift in our business strategy and our acquisition and development of certain brands  our branded apparel business has increased as a percentage of net sales from for fiscal to for fiscal we manage each brand individually  developing a distinct brand and marketing strategy for every product category and distribution channel 
we will continue to participate in cooperative advertising in print and broadcast media  as well as market directly to consumers through billboards  event sponsorships  celebrity sponsorships  special event advertisements and advertisements in selected periodicals 
in addition  we will continue to have a strong presence at trade shows  such as magic in las vegas  market week in new york  and golf and swim shows and events throughout the country 
licensing our brands to third parties also enhances brand recognition by providing increased customer exposure domestically and internationally  as well as opportunities for future product extensions 
continue to diversify our product line 
we intend to continue to expand the range of our product lines  thereby capitalizing on the name recognition  popularity  and discrete target customer segmentation of our major brands 
for example  we are introducing a line of women s beachwear and sportswear under the jantzen brand 
we intend to pursue expansion opportunities in young men s sportswear  whether through licensing or direct marketing opportunities

raphael brands  the better sportswear market 
we intend to use axis and tricots st 
raphael  as well as the expertise of salant s sales and marketing personnel  to expand our sweater business

increase penetration in each channel 
we will continue to selectively pursue new ways to increase our penetration of existing channels of distribution for our products  focusing on maintaining the integrity of our products and reinforcing our image at existing retail stores  as well as introducing our products to geographic areas and consumer sectors that are presently less familiar with our products 
we will also seek to expand our business with our existing customers by offering them products that are compelling and different from those in the marketplace and by capitalizing on our relationships with them by offering them more of our products 
as a result of the salant acquisition  we have increased the number of retailers that carry our brands and entered certain upscale department stores  such as nordstrom  which carry the axis and tricots st 
raphael brands

at the international level  we will continue to explore licensing opportunities where we see opportunities for growth  such as latin america  europe and asia 
we will continue to provide our licensing partners with strong brands  design expertise and innovative marketing strategies 
in addition to the revenues and brand awareness that licensing provides us  we also believe that licensing our brands benefits us by reducing the volatility of our operating income 
pursue strategic acquisitions and opportunities 
we intend to continue our strategy of making selective acquisitions to expand our portfolio of brands and add new product lines as our industry continues to follow the consolidation trend of our retailers 
we will continue to internally develop new brands and logical extensions of existing brands as opportunities in the marketplace arise

these retail stores are generally located in upscale retail outlet malls 
we believe that customer service is a key factor in successfully marketing our apparel products 
we coordinate efforts with customers to develop products meeting their specific needs using our design expertise and computer aided design technology 
utilizing our sourcing capabilities  we strive to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our in house sales staff is responsible for customer follow up and support  including monitoring prompt order fulfillment and timely delivery 
we utilize an electronic data interchange  or edi  system for certain customers in order to provide advance shipping notices  process orders and conduct billing operations 
in addition  certain customers use the edi system to communicate their weekly inventory requirements per store to us 
we then fill these orders either by shipping directly to the individual stores or by sending shipments  individually packaged and bar coded by store  to a centralized customer distribution center 
we recently launched perrysolutions  a software system that enables our sales planners to manage our retail customers inventory at the sku level 
this system helps maximize the sales of our products thereby increasing inventory turns for the retailer  which in turn reduces our product returns and markdowns and increases our profitability 
by using software that provides demographic mapping data  we can develop specific micro market plans for our customers that provide them with enhanced returns on our various product lines 
we sell merchandise to a broad spectrum of retailers  including national and regional chain  upscale department  mass merchants and specialty stores 
our largest customers include federated  may department stores  dillard s  wal mart  jc penney  kohl s  and sears 
we have developed and maintained long standing relationships with these customers  including dillard s more than years  may department stores more than years  jc penney more than years  sears years  federated years  wal mart years and kohl s years 
net sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
for fiscal  net sales to kohl s accounted for approximately of our net sales 
for fiscal  net sales to wal mart accounted for approximately of net sales 
for fiscal  net sales to target accounted for approximately of net sales  while net sales to j 
c 
penney and wal mart each accounted for approximately of net sales 
no other single customer accounted for more than of net sales during such fiscal years 
advertising and promotions we advertise to customers through print advertisements in a variety of consumer and trade magazines and newspapers and through outdoor advertising such as billboards strategically placed to be viewed by consumers 
for example  we are continuing jantzen s emphasis on print advertisements for our swimwear products in influential magazines such as sports illustrated  in style  glamour and vogue and intend to sponsor selected athletes and celebrities in the future 
in order to promote our men s sportswear at the retail level  we participate in cooperative advertising in print and broadcast media  which features our products in our customers advertisements 
the cost of this cooperative advertising is shared with our customers 
we also conduct various in store marketing activities with our customers  such as retail events and promotions  the costs of which are shared by our customers 
these events and promotions are in great part orchestrated to coincide with high volume shopping times such as holidays christmas and thanksgiving and father s day 
in addition to event promotion  we place perennial displays and signs of our products in retail establishments 
we use direct consumer advertising in selected markets featuring the perry ellis  cubavera  the havanera co  john henry  natural issue  munsingwear and grand slam brand names through the placement of highly visible billboards  sponsorships and special event advertising 
we also maintain informational websites featuring our brands 
we create and implement editorial and public relations strategies designed to heighten the visibility of our brands 
all of these activities are coordinated around each brand in an integrated marketing approach 

table of contents seasonality and backlog our products have historically been geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months 
we believe that this seasonality has been reduced with our introduction of fall  winter and holiday merchandise 
the swimwear business  however  is highly seasonal in nature  with the vast majority of our sales occurring in our first and fourth quarter 
we generally receive orders from our retailers approximately five to seven months prior to shipment 
for approximately of our sales  we have orders from our retailers before we place orders with our suppliers 
a summary of the order and delivery cycle for our four primary selling seasons  excluding swimwear  is illustrated below merchandise season advance order period delivery period to retailers spring july to september january to march summer october to december april and may fall january to march june to september holiday april to june october and november sales and receivables are recorded when inventory is shipped 
our backlog of orders includes confirmed and unconfirmed orders  which we believe  based on industry practice and past experience  will be confirmed 
as of april   the backlog for orders of our products  all of which are expected to be shipped during fiscal  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of march   which was prior to the salant acquisition 
the amount of unfilled orders at a point in time is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of product  the timing of the receipt and processing of customer orders and the scheduling of the sourcing and shipping of the product  which in most cases depends on the desires of the customer 
backlog is also affected by on going trends among customers to reduce the lead time on their orders 
since the fall of  our customers have been more cautious of their inventory levels and have delayed placing orders and re orders compared to our previous experience 
due to these factors a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments 
supply of products and quality control we currently use independent contract manufacturers to supply the substantial majority of the products we sell 
of the total dollar value of sourced products in fiscal    and were sourced from suppliers in asia  south and central america  the middle east and other areas of the world  respectively 
we believe that the use of numerous independent contract manufacturers allows us to maximize production flexibility  while avoiding significant capital expenditures  work in process inventory build ups and the costs of maintaining and operating production facilities 
we have had relationships with some suppliers for as long as years  however  none of these relationships are formal or require either party to purchase or supply any fixed quantity of product 
the vast majority of our non swimwear products are purchased as full packages  where we place an order with the supplier and the supplier purchases all the raw materials  assembles the garments and ships them to our distribution facilities or third party facilities 
for some of our swimwear business  which includes the jantzen  southpoint  nike and tommy hilfiger brands  we purchase fabric from domestic and international suppliers 
the purchased fabric is primarily cut in the united states 
the cut fabric is matched with various trim components and shipped to off shore sewing contractors located primarily in mexico and the caribbean basin enabling us to utilize exemptions under customs regulations  which provide that certain articles assembled abroad from united states components are exempt from united states duties on the value of those components 
this process is generally referred to as cmt cut  make and trim and differs from full package sourcing in that we  not the supplier  purchase and own the fabric and trim components 
we are  however  shifting the production of our swimwear business to the full package sourcing model and anticipate that in the future the vast majority of our purchases will be full packages 
finished goods are generally shipped to either our distribution facilities or to third party warehouses in california for repackaging and distribution to customers 
we maintain a staff of experienced sourcing professionals in five offices in china including hong kong  as well as the united states  south korea and taiwan 
this staff sources our products worldwide  monitors our suppliers purchases of raw material  and monitors production at contract manufacturing facilities in order to ensure quality control and timely delivery 
we also operate through independent agents in asia and the middle east 
our personnel based in our miami  florida office perform similar functions with respect to our suppliers in central america 
we conduct inspections of samples of each product prior to cutting by contractors during the manufacturing process and prior to shipment 
we also have full time quality assurance inspectors in latin america and the caribbean and in each of our overseas offices 
we also generally facilitate and aid our foreign contractors in obtaining raw materials 
otherwise  the foreign contractors 
table of contents purchase the raw material in accordance with our specifications 
raw materials  which are in most instances made and or colored especially for us  consist principally of piece goods and yarn and are specified by us from a number of foreign and domestic textile mills and converters 
we are committed to ethical sourcing standards and require our independent contractors to comply with our code of conduct 
we monitor compliance by our foreign contract manufacturers with applicable laws and regulations relating to  for example  the payment of wages  working conditions and the environment 
as part of our compliance program  we routinely perform audits of our contract manufacturers and require corrective action when appropriate 
our relationship with our foreign suppliers subjects us to the risks of doing business abroad 
as a result of our suppliers  in some instances  being at great geographic distances from us  our transportation costs are increased and longer lead times are required  which reduces our flexibility 
our finished goods are also subject to import duties  quotas and other restrictions 
the countries that we source our products from may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions or adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels  which could affect our ability to import products at the current or increased levels 
other risks in doing business with foreign suppliers include political or economic instability  any significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  terrorist activities  and restrictions on the transfer of funds 
although we have not been affected in a material way by any of the foregoing factors  we cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring and any material disruption may have an adverse affect on our business 
in order to assist with the timely delivery of finished goods  we function as our own customs broker for a majority of our deliveries 
we prepare our own customs documentation and arrange for any inspections or other clearance procedures with the united states customs service 
we are a member of the united states customs automated interface program 
this membership permits us to clear our goods through united states customs electronically and generally reduces the necessary clearance time to a matter of hours rather than days 
import and import restrictions our import operations are subject to constraints imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign countries including china  indonesia and korea 
these agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the united states from these countries 
such agreements also allow the united states to impose  at any time  restraints on the importation of categories of products that  under the terms of the agreements  are not subject to specified limits 
most of our imported products are also subject to united states customs duties and other charges 
we monitor duty  tariff  and quota related developments and continually seek to minimize our potential exposure to quota related risks through  among other measures  geographical diversification of our contract manufacturers  the maintenance of overseas offices  allocation of overseas production to product categories where more quota is available and shifts of production among countries and manufacturers 
under the terms of the world trade organization agreement on textiles and clothing  wto members have agreed to remove all quotas by january  because of our sourcing experience  capabilities and relationships  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the elimination of quotas by competition the retail apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
our competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  importers  licensors  and our own customers private label programs  many of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have available to us 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry are brand name and brand identity  timeliness  reliability and quality of services provided  market share and visibility  price  and the ability to anticipate customer and consumer demands and maintain appeal of products to customers 
we strive to focus on these points and have proven our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to customer demands with our brands  range of products and our ability to operate within the industry s production and delivery constraints 
we believe that our continued dedication to customer service  product assortment and quality control  as well as our aggressive pursuit of licensing and acquisition opportunities  directly addresses the competitive factors in all market segments 
our established brands and relationships with retailers have resulted in a loyal following of customers 

table of contents we understand that the level of competition and the nature of our competitors vary by product segment 
in particular  in the mass market channel  manufacturers constitute our main competitors in this less expensive segment of the market  while high profile domestic and foreign designers and licensors account for our main competitors in the more upscale segment of the market 
although we have been able to compete successfully to date  there can be no assurance that significant new competitors will not develop in the future 
trademarks our material trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office and in other countries 
we regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets that are critical in the marketing of our products  and  therefore  we vigorously protect our trademarks against infringements 
employees as of april   we had approximately  employees compared to approximately employees as of april  other than some of our employees at our winnsboro  south carolina distribution facility  none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
in fiscal  however  a labor organization attempted to organize certain employees of one of our subsidiaries at our miami  florida facility 
a national labor relations board supervised election was held on september  a majority of the employees at our miami distribution center who voted cast their ballots against unionization 
the labor organization filed objections to the election  and  after a lengthy review process  the national labor relations board ordered another election be held on may  at the may  election  a majority of the employees who voted cast their ballots against unionization 
the labor organization filed objections to this second election  which objections are pending before the national labor relations board 
we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 
certain risks our business faces certain risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business 
if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on a few key customers  and the loss of any one key customer would substantially reduce our revenues 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few major customers 
a significant decrease in business from or loss of any of our major customers could harm our financial condition by causing a significant decline in revenues attributable to such customers 
net sales to our five largest customers totaled approximately   and of net sales during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
our five largest customers are j 
c 
penney  kohl s  federated  may  and sears 
for fiscal  kohl s represented of our net sales 
net sales to wal mart accounted for approximately of net sales during fiscal net sales to target corporation  wal mart  and j 
c 
penney accounted for approximately  and of net sales during fiscal  respectively 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our net sales during these fiscal years 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our customers  we do not have long term contracts with any of them and purchases generally occur on an order by order basis 
we believe that purchasing decisions are generally made independently by individual department stores within a company controlled group 
there has been a trend  however  toward more centralized purchasing decisions 
as such decisions become more centralized  the risk to us of such concentration increases 
if our customers were to curtail or cease their purchase orders with us  our revenues could significantly decrease and our financial condition could be significantly harmed 
we may not be able to anticipate consumer preferences and fashion trends  which could negatively affect acceptance of our products by retailers and consumers and result in a significant decrease in net sales 
our failure to anticipate  identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect acceptance of our products by retailers and consumers and may result in a significant decrease in net sales or leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing fashion trends in a timely manner 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change 
we may not be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future 
in addition  any new products or brands that we introduce may not be 
table of contents successfully received by retailers and consumers 
due to the fact that we began marketing women s apparel with the acquisition of the jantzen swimwear business in fiscal  we may be more subject to additional changes in fashion trends as women s fashion trends have historically changed more rapidly than men s 
if our products are not successfully received by retailers and consumers and we are left with a substantial amount of unsold inventory  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess  slow moving inventory 
if this occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects may be harmed 
our business could be negatively impacted by the financial instability of our customers 
during the past several years  various retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced significant difficulties  including bankruptcies  liquidations  consolidation of ownership  and increased centralization of buying decisions 
for example  kmart corporation and casual male corp 
filed for protection from creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
these and other financial problems of some of our customers increase the risk of extending credit to these retailers 
consistent with industry practices  we sell products primarily on open account after completing an appropriate credit review 
a significant adverse change in a customer or its financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer  all of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation by causing a significant decline in revenues attributable to such customers 
we are dependent upon the revenues generated by our licensing alliances and the loss or inability to renew certain licenses could reduce our royalty income or net sales and consequently reduce our net income 
a portion of our net income is derived from licensing income received from our licensing partners 
the interruption of the business of several of our licensing partners at any one time could adversely affect our royalty income and net income 
licensing income accounted for million or of total revenues for fiscal we currently license the ping  nike  tommy hilfiger  nautica and ocean pacific brands from third parties 
these licenses vary in length of term  renewal conditions and royalty obligations 
the average term of these licenses is three to five years with automatic renewals depending upon whether we achieve certain targeted sales goals 
we may not be able to renew or extend any of these licenses  on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to renew or extend any of these licenses  we could experience a decrease in net sales 
we may face challenges integrating salant  which may negatively impact our business 
we will need to integrate salant s business into our operations in order to achieve the anticipated benefits of the salant acquisition 
we may face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating management procedures  personnel and operations in an efficient and effective manner which may negatively impact our business 
some of these challenges include increased demands on management related to the significant increase in the size and diversity of our business after the salant acquisition  the diversion of management s attention to implement our strategies for the salant business  the retention and integration of key salant employees  analyzing aspects of salant s business that are to be kept separate and distinct from our other businesses  and difficulties in assimilating salant s corporate culture and practices into ours 
we may not have uncovered all the risks associated with the salant acquisition or any future acquisitions and a significant liability may arise after closing 
there may be additional risks that we failed to discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigations related to the salant acquisition and any future acquisitions which could result in significant liabilities arising after the consummation of such transactions 
in connection with the salant acquisition  we assumed all of salant s liabilities  whether pre existing or contingent  as a matter of law 
moreover  as in the salant acquisition  to the extent we acquire all of the capital stock of potential future sellers  we will assume all of the seller s liabilities as a matter of law 
as is customary in transactions similar to the salant acquisition  the merger agreement did not provide for our indemnification against any of salant s liabilities should they arise or become known to us after the closing 
such liabilities could include those arising from the trademarks  employee benefits and pension contribution obligations of a prior owner  accounting and financial reporting matters  tax matters and noncompliance with applicable federal  state or local environmental requirements by prior owners for which we  as a successor owner  may potentially be responsible 
while we tried to minimize these risks by conducting such due diligence  including trademark  employee benefits and environmental reviews  that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances  we may not have identified all existing or potential risks 
any significant liability that may arise may harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects by requiring us to expend significant funds to satisfy such liability 

table of contents we need significant working capital to fund our operations  a substantial portion of which is financed  and our inability to continue to finance such working capital could affect our marketing and sales efforts because our ability to purchase inventory would be curtailed 
we need significant working capital to purchase inventory and are often required to post letters of credit when placing an order with one of our foreign manufacturers 
we meet our working capital needs through our operating cash flow  our senior credit facility and letter of credit facilities 
if we are unable to extend or renew either our senior credit facility or letter of credit facilities on satisfactory terms or in the event borrowings thereunder were unavailable to us as a result of any noncompliance with any covenants contained therein  our ability to purchase inventory would be curtailed or eliminated  which would significantly affect our marketing and sales efforts  thus harming our business 
we have a significant amount of debt  which could have important negative consequences to us  including making it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations in the event we experience financial difficulties 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had million of debt outstanding excluding amounts outstanding under our letter of credit facilities 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our senior secured notes and our senior subordinated notes  including our ability to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a change of control  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  limiting the rights of our holders of senior subordinated notes to receive payments if holders of our secured debt have not been paid  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors 
our ability to pay interest on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is  to a large extent  dependent on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness or to meet our other obligations  we will need to refinance our existing debt  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow  or that we will be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
to service our existing and future debt  we will require a significant amount of cash  which may not be available to us 
our ability to make payments on or refinance our debt will depend largely upon our future operating performance and cash flow 
our future operating performance and cash flow are subject to many factors  including general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the interest and principal on our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to generate cash to meet our debt service requirements  we may have to renegotiate or refinance the terms of our debt 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  prior to the repayment of our senior subordinated notes  we will be required to repay or refinance our senior credit facility and  perhaps  any other debt we incur 
any new debt we incur may have a shorter maturity than our existing debt 
payment of such debt will reduce the amount of funds available to us to make payments on our existing debt 

table of contents if we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances  we would have to consider other options  such as selling certain assets to meet our debt service obligations or using cash  if available  that would have been used for other business purposes 
these options may not be feasible or may be inadequate  and may also adversely affect our operations or the implementation of our business plan 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior secured notes and the senior subordinated notes may restrict  or market or business conditions may limit  our ability to do some of these things 
non payment or other non compliance with our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes or the instruments governing our other debt could result in an event of default under our other instruments governing our debt 
our swimwear business has not been profitable 
we acquired the jantzen swimwear business in march  which business has not yet been profitable 
our future results may be adversely impacted if this business remains unprofitable 
our swimwear business is highly seasonal in nature and revenue and profitability can be adversely affected by climate and other factors 
the vast majority of swimwear shipments to our customers occur in our first and fourth quarters 
adverse weather  temporary disruptions in the supply chain and other factors that result in reduced or delayed shipments to customers could impact the profitability of the swimwear business  which in turn may negatively impact our consolidated net income 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry and our failure to successfully compete could result in a loss of one or more significant customers 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
our competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  importers and licensors  many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are brand name and brand identity  timeliness  reliability and quality of services provided  market share and visibility  price  and the ability to anticipate customer and consumer demands and maintain appeal of products to customers 
the level of competition and the nature of our competitors varies by product segment with low margin  mass market manufacturers being our main competitors in the less expensive segment of the market and us and foreign designers and licensors competing with us in the more upscale segment of the market 
if we do not maintain our brand names and identities and continue to provide high quality and reliable services on a timely basis at competitive prices  we may not be able to continue to compete in our industry 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we could lose one or more of our significant customers which  if not replaced  could negatively impact our sales and financial performance 
we depend on certain key personnel the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent on retaining the services of certain executive officers and directors  in particular george feldenkreis  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and oscar feldenkreis  our president and chief operating officer 
they are each party to an employment agreement  which was renewed in december for an additional two year period expiring in may the loss of the services of either george feldenkreis or oscar feldenkreis  or any other key member of management  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  administrative and sales personnel to support our future growth 
our inability to do so may have a significant negative impact on our ability to manage our business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we began operations in as supreme international corporation and initially focused our efforts on marketing guayabera shirts  and other men s apparel products targeted at the hispanic market in florida and puerto rico 
over time we expanded our product line to offer a variety of men s sport shirts 
in  we developed the natural issue brand and completed our initial public offering in in  we began an expansion strategy through the acquisition of brands including the munsingwear family of brands in  the john henry and manhattan brands from salant in and the perry ellis brand in following the perry ellis acquisition  we changed our name from supreme international corporation to perry ellis international  inc to better reflect the name recognition that the brand provided 
in  we acquired the jantzen brand and in june we acquired salant  our largest licensee  giving us greater control of the perry ellis brand  as well as adding other brands owned by salant 
we believe we are one of the leading apparel companies in the united states 
we control a portfolio of major men s and women s brands  some of which were established over years ago 
we design  source  market and license our products nationally and internationally at multiple price points and across all major levels of retail distribution at more than  doors 
the levels of retail distribution include department stores  national and regional chain stores  mass merchants  specialty stores  sporting goods stores  green grass golf shops  the corporate incentive market and independent retailers in the united states and canada 
our largest customers include federated  dillard s  may department stores  wal mart  jc penney  kohl s  and sears 
we also operate retail stores located primarily in upscale retail outlet malls across the united states 
in addition  we leverage our design  sourcing and logistics expertise by offering a limited number of private label programs to retailers 
in order to maximize the worldwide exposure of our brands and generate high margin royalty income  we license our brands through approximately domestic and approximately international license agreements 
our licensing business is a significant contributor to our operating income 
in fiscal  we experienced a increase in total revenue and a increase in net income 
these increases were primarily due to our acquisition of salant and organic growth offset by a decrease in royalty income 
the record net income results we realized in fiscal came despite the fact that our swimwear business performed at levels below our expectations 
our wholesale business  which is comprised of men s sportswear and women s and men s swimwear and swimwear accessories  accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal  and our licensing business accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal we have traditionally focused on the men s sportswear market  which represented approximately of our total wholesale revenues in fiscal  while the women s and men s swimwear market represented approximately of our total wholesale revenues in fiscal in june  we acquired salant  a leading designer  marketer and distributor of brand name and private label menswear products and the largest licensee of the perry ellis brand 
with the salant acquisition we have consolidated control of the perry ellis brand  added significant revenues and earnings  solidified our balance sheet  further diversified our product offerings and customer base  and added to our portfolio of brands 
as a result of this acquisition  we also assumed operation of retail outlet stores  of which we have since closed four 
the salant business represented approximately million of the million in total revenue growth we experienced in fiscal 
table of contents our products have historically been geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months 
we believe that this seasonality has been reduced with our introduction of fall  winter  and holiday merchandise 
our swimwear business  however  is highly seasonal in nature  with the significant majority of its sales occurring in our first and fourth quarters 
our higher priced products generally tend to be less sensitive to either economic or weather conditions 
seasonality can be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of advance and fill in orders  the amount of sales to different distribution channels  and overall product mix among traditional merchandise  fashion merchandise and swimwear 
we expect that revenues for our second quarter will typically be lower than our other quarters due to the impact of seasonal sales 
we believe that our future growth will come as a result of our continued emphasis on our existing brands  new and expanded product lines  increases in our sales of bottoms  sweaters  swimwear and accessories  domestic and international licensing  multi brand development for the fast growing hispanic market  and selective acquisitions and opportunities that fit strategically with our business model 
our expected future growth in these areas may be offset somewhat by a decreased focus on private label business 
in the past few years  the general decline in the us economy has resulted in lower consumer spending 
retailers have responded to the general sense of economic weakness by delaying the placement of orders  reducing orders  and implementing aggressive price discounting and promotional activities 
many retailers  including some of our customers  have prioritized their own private label products or have instituted competitive internet based global bidding processes for their private label business that  in some cases  are designed to effectively reduce margins to a level that are no longer attractive to us 
in addition  during the past several years various retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced significant difficulties including bankruptcies  liquidations and reorganizations 
all of these factors have materially adversely affected the apparel industry 
furthermore  the geopolitical situation has adversely affected the us economy and consequently the apparel industry 
we believe  however  that the current us economy has improved in recent months 
this improvement has led to the improved results of our customers 
we believe that the improved economy and the resulting increase in demand for apparel should benefit us for the foreseeable future
