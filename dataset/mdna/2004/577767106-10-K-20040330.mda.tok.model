we aim to design and manufacture our products to perform reliably for the life of the products and systems into which they are integrated 
we seek to achieve high reliability through the application of proprietary technologies and rigorously controlled design  development  manufacturing and test processes 
this high reliability strategy emphasizes the development and marketing of products that enable us to achieve higher profit margins than commodity electronic components and systems 
during the year ended december   we continued our efforts to focus our business and to exit non strategic businesses 
these efforts culminated in our exit from the low margin power magnetics business and commensurate consolidation of the remaining value added business into our ultracapacitor product line  and the sale of our winding equipment business segment 
as the result of these actions  as well as other divestitures throughout and  we have consolidated our operations into our high reliability business segment 
see part i  item business strategic consolidation of operations  part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events  and notes and to our notes to consolidated financial statements  for information regarding our business combinations  divestitures and phased out operations 
products and applications our products apply our expertise and proprietary power and microelectronics technology at both the component and system level for specialized  high value applications for which customers require high reliability 
we are recognized as a leading supplier of high reliability power and microelectronic components and systems for a wide variety of high value applications 
ultracapacitors an ultracapacitor  also known as a supercapacitor  stores energy electrostatically by polarizing an electrolytic solution 
although it is an electrochemical device  there are no chemical reactions involved in its energy storage mechanism 
the mechanism is highly reversible  allowing the ultracapacitor to be rapidly charged and discharged hundreds of thousands of times for various peak power applications 
unlike conventional batteries  ultracapacitors can be recharged in as little as fractions of a second from any electrical energy source  and they operate reliably through hundreds of thousands to millions of discharge recharge cycles with minimal degradation of performance 
traditional capacitors have very little energy storage capacity and discharge power too rapidly to be suitable for many power delivery applications 
ultracapacitors have much greater energy storage capacity than traditional capacitors and can discharge power over time periods ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes 
used in tandem with batteries  ultracapacitors can deliver bursts of energy to meet power demand peaks  enhance system performance and  thus  significantly extend battery life 
in applications where alternative sources of recharge energy are available  ultracapacitors can replace batteries entirely 
our ultracapacitors can be linked together in modules to satisfy higher energy storage and power delivery requirements  and can be charged from any primary energy source  such as a battery  generator  fuel cell or electrical outlet 
virtually any device that has peak power demands greater than its average power requirement is a candidate for our ultracapacitors as part of its energy storage and power delivery system 
our ultracapacitor products have significant advantages over alternative choices  including delivery of up to times more instantaneous power  significantly lower weight per unit of electrical energy stored  the ability to discharge deeper and recharge much faster and more efficiently  the ability to operate reliably in extreme temperatures degrees c to degrees c  minimal maintenance requirements  operational reliability for the life of the device or system  and minimal environmental issues associated with disposal 
any device or system that requires storage of electrical energy and repeated discharges of variable amounts of power represents a potential application for ultracapacitors 
with no moving parts and no chemical reactions  ultracapacitors provide a simple  solid state  highly reliable solution to buffer short term mismatches between power available and power required 
ultracapacitors high electrical energy storage capacity  their ability to deliver rapid bursts of high power and their ability to recharge rapidly from any energy source over hundreds of thousands to millions of cycles  make them a preferred solution for a wide variety of applications ranging from handheld consumer electronic devices  to all electric automotive subsystems and hybrid electric vehicle drive trains 
new power hungry electronic products  such as digital cameras and wireless communication devices  the increasing use of electric power in vehicles and the growing demand for highly reliable  maintenance free  back up power systems are creating significant markets for new energy storage and power delivery solutions 
in many applications  power demand varies widely from moment to moment  with peak power demand typically much greater than the average power requirement 
for example  automobiles require much more power to accelerate from a stop than to maintain a constant speed  and digital cameras require more power to display images on a screen than to store images in memory 
see part i  item business risk factors  for information regarding the risks associated with widespread acceptance of large cell ultracapacitors and transportation applications  and information regarding the commercial viability of large cell ultracapacitors 
engineers historically have addressed power requirements by over designing the engine  battery or other primary energy source to satisfy all of the system s power demands  including demand peaks that occur infrequently and may last only a few seconds 
sizing the primary power source to meet such infrequent peak power requirements  rather than average power requirements  is costly and inefficient 
systems can be designed to be smaller  lighter and less costly by coupling conventional power sources with specialized energy storage components or modules that can deliver brief bursts of high power on demand for periods of time ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes 
the following diagram depicts the separation of a primary energy storage source from a peak power delivery component 
highly reliable components that enable this separation permit new designs to optimize the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the entire electrical power system 
peak power application model chart although conventional batteries historically are the most widely used component for both primary energy sourcing and peak power delivery  ultracapacitors  advanced batteries and flywheels increasingly are being used to separate and optimize these functions 
based  in part  on our products rapidly declining cost  high performance and life of the application durability  we believe that our ultracapacitors are positioned to become a preferred component for many energy storage and peak power delivery applications 
we offer our boostcap ultracapacitors in several form factors  ranging from postage stamp size farad small cells to cylindrical  farad large cells approximately two inches in diameter and six inches long 
we also offer our powercache modules  which are rack mounted energy storage modules containing multiple boostcap large cell ultracapacitors 
we are supplying our boostcap ultracapacitors in volumes and at price points that are opening numerous market opportunities for us 
our smaller sized ultracapacitors have been designed into digital cameras and other consumer electronic devices  industrial electronics such as actuators  remote transmitting devices  high intensity scanners  computer memory boards and transportation applications such as subway car alarm systems and electric actuators that replace mechanical latches in aircraft and automobile doors 
many products into which our small cell ultracapacitors have been designed now are in commercial production 
our large cell ultracapacitors have been designed into industrial applications such as uninterruptible power supply systems and transportation applications such as hybrid buses  trucks and autos  electric rail systems and capacitive starting systems for diesel trucks and locomotives 
we received our first commercial production order to supply ultracapacitors for hybrid gasoline electric transit buses in february  and other large cell design ins are progressing through the field test and evaluation phase 
see part i  item business risk factors  for information regarding the risks associated with widespread acceptance of large cell ultracapacitors and transportation applications  and information regarding the commercial viability of large cell ultracapacitors

we expect increased sampling and prototyping activity in  with certain applications moving into commercial production by the end of the year 
in preparation for this commercial production  we are currently installing our first highly automated  large cell assembly line  which we expect to be completed by year end applications such as bus  truck and auto drive trains  electric rail systems and uninterruptible power supplies require integrated modules consisting of up to hundreds of ultracapacitor cells 
to facilitate adoption of ultracapacitors for these larger systems  we are complementing our internal capabilities with those of third parties who possess the systems integration and power and thermal management capabilities to provide fully integrated systems and modules 
see part i  item business risk factors  for the risks associated with widespread acceptance of large cell ultracapacitors and transportation applications  and information regarding the commercial viability of large cell ultracapacitors 
we have also developed integration technologies to accelerate the adoption by our customers of multi cell ultracapacitor modules and systems 
these include proprietary electrical balancing  thermal management systems and interconnect technologies 
high voltage capacitors electric utility grids have switches  circuit breakers  step down transformers and measurement instruments responsible for the transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electricity 
high voltage capacitors are used to protect these systems from high voltage arcing 
in addition to performance  these applications require extremely high reliability and durability  with failure rates less than a few percent measured in decades 
maxwell  through its acquisition in of montena components ltd  or montena  and its condis line of high voltage capacitor products  is the world s largest producer of such products  with more than years of experience in the industry 
engineers who have specific expertise in high voltage systems develop and test our capacitors in our high voltage laboratory in rossens  switzerland 
our high voltage capacitors are produced through a proprietary  automated winding and assembly process to ensure consistent quality and reliability 
we intend to upgrade our high voltage capacitor production facility in to double its output capacity and significantly shorten order delivery intervals 
currently  we sell our high voltage capacitors to large systems integrators  such as abb ltd  alstrom corporation and siemens ag  who install and service electrical utilities around the world 
radiation mitigated microelectronic products manufacturers of commercial and military satellites and other spacecraft require on board microelectronic devices and systems that meet specific functional requirements and can withstand exposure to solar radiation that is encountered in space 
in the past  microelectronic components and systems for these special applications have used only radiation hardened silicon 
however  the process of designing and producing radiation hardened silicon is lengthy and expensive and there are fewer specialty fabricators  so supply of radiation hardened silicon is limited 
as a result  demand for components made with the latest commercial silicon  protected by shielding and other radiation mitigation techniques  is growing 
commercial silicon provides higher functionality and costs significantly less than radiation hardened silicon 
the ability to provide radiation mitigated commercial silicon requires expertise in power electronics  circuit design  silicon selection  radiation shielding and extensive expertise in quality assurance testing 
we design  manufacture and market radiation mitigated microelectronic products  including power modules  memory modules and single board computers  for the space and satellite markets 
using highly adaptable  proprietary  packaging and shielding and other radiation mitigation techniques  we custom design products that allow original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to use powerful  low cost  commercial silicon protected with the level of radiation shielding required for reliable performance in the environment in which they are to be deployed 
business strategy our primary objective is to make ultracapacitors an accepted energy option and for maxwell to become a leading ultracapacitor company 
to accomplish this  we focus on becoming a standard energy option by facilitating the integration of ultracapacitors into power hungry applications through training engineers in the methodology of integration of ultracapacitors  using educational techniques including seminars  apprenticeships and white papers  participating in standards committees  and integrating ultracapacitor mathematical models into broadly accepted simulation software  among other efforts 
by demonstrating the broad application universe of ultracapacitors  including through government sponsored projects  competitions and demonstrations 
by partnering with key customers in strategic application fields 
becoming a leading ultracapacitor company by focusing on cost enabled markets 
by designing products for the life of the application 
by being a highly reliable supplier through global sourcing 
by maintaining the highest level of technology and performance while focusing on product cost 
by developing and deploying enabling systems  cell balancing systems  smart modules  charging systems and safety compliance systems 
by maintaining broad and deep protections of key intellectual property 
in addition  we seek to expand revenue and market opportunities for our high voltage capacitors and radiation mitigated microelectronic products 
while these are niche business areas with highly specialized applications  they also represent high margin products for which we are a leading technology provider 
going forward  we plan to maintain and expand this competitive position by leveraging our technological expertise to develop new products that not only meet the demands of our current markets  but also address additional applications as well 
for example  we recently introduced a new single board computer for the space and satellite market 
this product  which leverages our expertise in reliability and radiation mitigated microelectronics  provides access to a new market opportunity by addressing an application that we did not already serve 
manufacturing we have consolidated the manufacturing of our ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and radiation mitigated microelectronic products into two production facilities located in san diego  california  and rossens  switzerland 
over the past four years  we have made substantial capital investments to build and outfit state of the art production facilities  which include both mechanization and full scale automation 
we have also added an advanced information technology infrastructure  and have implemented new manufacturing and business processes and systems to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency  planning and product quality 
our production facilities have been designed with flexible overhead power grids and modular manufacturing cells and equipment that allow factory operations to be reconfigured rapidly at minimal expense 
we believe that our manufacturing facilities and resources give us sufficient capacity to meet near term demand for all of our product lines and to expand capacity as required without significant additional capital expenditure 
see part i  item business risk factors  for information regarding the risks associated with expansion of our manufacturing capacity 
acceptance of our ultracapacitor products and high voltage capacitor products depends in part on compliance and certification with a number of us and foreign standards for electronic components and systems 
among the entities that promulgate such standards are underwriters laboratories  canadian standards association and committee european 
we incorporate compliance with such standards into our quality assurance protocols in building and testing these products 
ultracapacitors in  we installed an automated assembly line for our farad and farad small cell ultracapacitors at our san diego production facility 
this line can produce approximately  to  small cells per hour production day 
current production is approximately  to  small cells per day based on a hour production day 
we produce our large cell ultracapacitors on a pilot production line in our rossens  switzerland  production facility 
we are in the process of installing our first high volume  semi automated manufacturing lines for our farad to  farad ultracapacitors in our swiss facility 
we are also in the process of redesigning our larger form factor products to facilitate this automation and to incorporate lower cost materials 
in addition to significantly reducing material cost  the new designs reduced both the number of parts in a finished cell and the number of manufacturing process steps to a fraction of those required for previous designs 
in february  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance with yeong long technologies co  ltd  or yec 
yec is a million per annum manufacturer of electrolytic capacitors headquartered in taichung  taiwan  with manufacturing and sales operations in mainland china 
we entered into this alliance in order to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china  and to help position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors with production facilities in north america and europe  and access to facilities in asia 
this alliance allows yec to produce and sell our ultracapacitor products on a non exclusive basis in the chinese market  under a royalty bearing agreement 
it also provides for yec to develop products in new form factors  and it permits us to utilize yec s manufacturing capacity for our distribution outside of china 
high voltage capacitors we produce our high voltage grading and coupling capacitors at our rossens  switzerland  production facility 
we are the only high voltage capacitor producer that manufactures its products with automated winding and stacking  and assembly processes 
this enables us to produce consistent  high quality and highly reliable products  and gives us sufficient capacity to satisfy global customer demand 
we are upgrading the assembly portion of the process to a cell based  just in time design this year  in order to double our current production capacity without additional direct labor or capital  and shorten order to delivery times 
we estimate that by mid  using state of the art manufacturing techniques  the new production facility will be capable of reducing lead times by and doubling production output 
we believe this upgrade will allow us to expand our market penetration into capacitive voltage divider products  which we estimate would double the size of the market we currently serve 
radiation mitigated microelectronics products we produce our radiation mitigated microelectronics products at our san diego production facility 
we have reengineered our production processes for radiation mitigated microelectronics  resulting in dramatic reductions in cycle time and a significant increase in yield 
customer audits confirm our belief that we have top tier manufacturing capabilities for highly reliable  radiation mitigated power modules  memory modules and single board computers  and that we have ample capacity to meet the demands of our customers in the space and satellite markets 
our radiation mitigated microelectronics production operations include die characterization  packaging  electrical  environmental and life testing 
during and  manufacturing cycle times were reduced and operator productivity increased  such that the current facility is capable of doubling production volumes without the need for additional direct labor or capital 
suppliers we generally purchase components and materials  such as electronic components  dielectric materials and enclosures of metal and plastic  from a number of suppliers 
for certain products  such as our radiation mitigated microelectronic products or our high voltage capacitors  we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier 
although we believe there are alternative sources for some of the components and materials that we currently obtain from a single source  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify alternative suppliers in a timely manner 
therefore  in critical component areas  we bank  or store  critical high value materials  especially silicon die 
we are working to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers through an extensive global sourcing effort 
see part i  item business risk factors  for information regarding risks associated with securing sources for our materials 
marketing and sales we market and sell all of our components and systems products through both direct and indirect sales organizations in north america  europe and asia for integration by oem customers into larger systems and other products 
because the introduction of emerging technologies requires customer acceptance of new and different technical approaches  and because many of our oem customers have rigorous vendor qualification processes  the initial sale of our products can take months or even years 
our principal marketing strategy is to cultivate long term customer relationships by becoming a preferred supplier with an opportunity to compete for multiple supply agreements and follow on contracts with our key oem customers 
as these design in sales tend to be technical and engineering intensive  we organize customer specific teams composed of sales  engineering  research and development and other technical personnel to work closely with our customers across multiple disciplines to satisfy their requirements for form  fit  function  environment and mechanics 
as time to market often is the primary consideration in our customers decisions to outsource components or systems and in their selection of a vendor  the initial sale and design in process frequently evolves into ongoing account management to their outsource sub contractors to ensure on time delivery and responsive technical support and problem solving 
because of the nature of each of our three product lines  we conduct discrete marketing programs intended to position and promote our products 
these include trade shows  seminars  advertising  public relations  distribution of product literature and internet websites 
we employ marketing communications specialists to develop and implement our marketing programs  design and develop marketing materials  negotiate advertising media purchases  write and place product news releases and manage our marketing websites 
we have an alliance with yec to manufacture and market our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitor products in china 
through this alliance  we seek to expand our ultracapacitor product line into china 
see part i  item business manufacturing  for information regarding our relationship with yec 
competition each of our product lines has competitors  many of whom have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
in some of the target markets for our emerging technologies  we face competition both from products utilizing well established  existing technologies and alternative novel technologies 
ultracapacitors our ultracapacitor products have two types of competitors other ultracapacitor suppliers and developers of alternative technologies 
although a number of companies are developing ultracapacitor technology  we have two principal competitors in ultracapacitor or supercapacitor products panasonic  a division of matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  and epcos ag 
the key competitive factors in the ultracapacitor market are price  performance energy stored and power delivered per unit volume  durability and reliability  form factor  operational lifetime and breadth of product offerings 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these competitive factors 
ultracapacitors also compete with other technologies  including advanced batteries in power quality and peak power applications  and with flywheels and batteries in back up energy storage applications 
we believe that their high durability  long life  high performance and low cost give ultracapacitors a competitive advantage over these alternative choices 
in addition  in many applications  a coupling of ultracapacitors with some of these alternative solutions provide an optimized solution for the customer 
high voltage capacitors maxwell  through its acquisition in of montena and its condis line of high voltage capacitor products  is the world s largest producer of such products 
our principal competitors in the high voltage capacitor markets are in house production groups of certain of our customers and other independent manufacturers  such as the coil product division of trench limited in canada and europe and hochspannungsger te porz gmbh in germany 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to being a consistent supplier of highly reliable high voltage capacitors  and with respect to our expertise in high voltage systems 
over the last ten years  our largest customer  abb ltd  has gone from predominantly in house production of grading and coupling capacitors to outsourcing of their needs to us 
radiation mitigated microelectronic products our radiation mitigated power modules  memory modules and single board computers compete with the products of traditional radiation hardened integrated circuit suppliers such as honeywell corporation  lockheed martin corporation and bae systems 
we also compete with commercial suppliers with product lines that have favorable radiation tolerance characteristics  such as national semiconductor corporation  analog devices inc and temic instruments bv in europe 
our proprietary radiation mitigation technology enables us to provide flexible  low cost  radiation protection solutions utilizing the most advanced commercial electronic circuits and processors 
in that market  we compete with high reliability packaging houses such as austin semiconductor  inc  white microelectronics  inc and teledyne microelectronics  a unit of teledyne technologies  inc  for monolithic and multichip modules 
research and development we maintain active research and development programs to improve existing products and to develop new products 
for the year ended december   our research and development expenditures totaled approximately million  compared with million and million in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease reflects the divestiture of several business lines and the elimination of associated research and development expense 
in general  we focus our research and product development activities on designing and producing products that perform reliably for the life of the end product into which they are integrated  making our products less expensive to produce  to enable market growth through competitive pricing  designing our products to have state of the art technical performance  designing new products that provide novel solutions to expand our market opportunities  and designing our products to have small size and weight 
most of the current research  development and engineering activity for our products is focused on material sciences  including electrically conducting and dielectric materials  ceramics and radiation tolerant silicon and ceramic composites  to improve performance  reliability  ease of manufacture and cost 
efforts also are focused on product design for high volume manufacturing  manufacturing engineering and manufacturing processes 
the principal focus of our ultracapacitor development activities is to increase power density and power delivery and to dramatically reduce the cost of using the technology 
our ultracapacitor designs focus on low cost  high capacity devices in standard sizes ranging from farad to  farad cells 
we seek to penetrate cost sensitive applications at multi million unit volumes 
the principal focus of our high voltage capacitor development efforts is to enhance reliability and reduce the weight and size of the capacitors while improving high voltage performance characteristics 
we also are directing our design efforts to develop high voltage capacitors for additional applications 
the principal focus of our microelectronics product development activities is on circuit design  shielding and other radiation mitigation techniques that allow the use of powerful commercial silicon components in space and satellite applications where ultra high reliability is an absolute requirement 
we are also focused on the creation of system solutions which overcome the basic failure rate of individual components through architectural approaches  including redundancy  mitigation and correction 
this involves expertise in system architecture  including algorithm and micro code development  circuit design and the physics of radiation effects on silicon electronic components 
intellectual property we are continuing to place increased emphasis on inventing proprietary technologies that significantly increase the value and uniqueness of our product portfolio  and on obtaining patents to provide the broadest possible protection for those products and related technologies 
our ultimate success will depend in part on our ability to protect existing patents  pursue patent protection and develop new technologies not protected by the patents of third parties 
as of december   we held issued patents and had more than pending patent applications in the us of that total  issued patents related to our ultracapacitor and microelectronics technology and products 
of these patents  one expires in august  and the balance expire at various times ranging from to all of the remaining patents relate to purification and sterilization technology developed by purepulse  which suspended operations in our pending patent applications and any future patent applications may not be allowed 
we routinely seek to protect our new developments and technologies through obtaining patents in the us and corresponding foreign patents in the principal countries of europe and asia 
at present  with the minor exceptions of microcode architectures within our radiation mitigated microelectronics product line  we do not rely on licenses from any third parties to produce or commercialize our products 
the existing patent portfolios and pending patent applications covering the technologies associated with our ultracapacitor and microelectronic products relate primarily to ultracapacitors the electrode design and its fabrication  the physical cell package design and the process used in its production  intracell interconnect technologies that increase the power performance of the boostcap product  and module and system designs that facilitate applications of ultracapacitor technology 
microelectronics system architectures that enable commercial silicon products to be used in harsh radiation environments  packaging technologies and designs that mitigate the effect of radiation on commercial silicon  and radiation mitigation techniques that improve performance while protecting the silicon from harsh radiation environments 
historically  our high voltage capacitor products have been based on our know how and trade secrets rather than on patents 
we filed our first patent application covering our high voltage capacitor technology in the first quarter of  and we will continue to pursue patent protection in addition to trade secret protection of certain aspects of the products and their production 
establishing and protecting proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our strategy 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent infringement  misappropriation or other misuse by third parties  or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us see part i  item business risk factors  for information regarding the risks associated with our failure to protect our intellectual property 
we use employee and third party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know how 
we require each of our employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all our proprietary information and  subject to certain exceptions  to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment with us 
in addition  we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties  such as potential product development partners and customers 
backlog backlog for continuing operations for the years ended december   and was at approximately million  million and million  respectively 
year to year comparisons are influenced by divestitures in  and of significant business activities 
backlog consists of firm orders for products that will be delivered within months 
because we have dramatically reduced production cycle times  our customers are less likely to commit firm purchase orders as far in advance of their production needs as they did in the past 
government regulation due to the nature of our operations and the use of hazardous substances in some of our ongoing manufacturing and research and development activities  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing workplace safety and protection of the environment  including the use  generation  manufacturing  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
in the course of our historical operations  materials or wastes may have spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials and wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties and the materials and wastes spilled  released  or disposed thereon are subject to environmental laws that may impose strict liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  for remediation of contamination resulting from such releases 
under such laws and regulations  we could be required to remediate previously spilled  released  or disposed substances or wastes or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations also could result in the assessment of substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties and even the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our activities 
moreover  it is possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we not will incur substantial costs in the future 
in addition  certain of our microelectronics products are subject to international traffic in arms export regulations when shipping outside of the us foreign sales our revenue from customers outside of the us was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of our total revenue for such years  respectively 
we expect foreign sales to continue to increase as a percentage of our revenue  as most of our north american commercial customers are outsourcing more of their production offshore 
we continue to develop international relationships and seek to broaden the use of our products in international markets 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  for information regarding our sales and foreign currency risk 
significant customers sales to abb ltd 
amounted to million  or  of our total revenue for the year ended december  we have a long term supply agreement with abb ltd 
that was renewed in march and ends in march sales of magnetics based power systems products to general electric medical systems amounted to approximately million  or  of our total revenue for the year ended december  our magnetics based power systems operations were phased out in see part i  item business strategic consolidation of operations  part ii  item 
management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events  and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our consolidation activities 
employees at march   we had full time employees  including in the us and in switzerland 
none of our us employees are members of a labor union 
nearly all of our employees in switzerland are members of a labor union 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
strategic consolidation of operations commencing in  we adopted a plan to reorganize our operations and focus on two key aspects of our business  our electronic components business and our industrial computing systems business 
as part of this plan of restructuring  in we combined our powercache ultracapacitor business  our sierra kd emi filter and ceramic capacitor business and our space electronics  inc radiation shielded microelectronics business into our electronic components group 
we also combined our applied computing systems business  in which we were engaged through our subsidiary  i bus  inc  or i bus  with our power quality systems business  in which we were engaged through our subsidiary  san diego based phoenix power systems  inc  or phoenix 
we refer to the combined operations of those two subsidiaries as i bus phoenix 
in addition  in  we disposed of certain non core businesses 
in march  we sold our government systems business and  in june  we sold our sierra kd emi filter and ceramic capacitor business 
see part ii  item 
management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events  and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our consolidation activities 
at the end of and continuing into  our target telecommunications markets for our i bus phoenix computing systems business deteriorated 
during this same time period  our customers cycle time of designing products using our ultracapacitors and having such products enter commercial production was longer than we had expected 
the negative effects of such factors on our business resulted in our cost structure and production capacity exceeding our immediate revenue opportunities 
we determined that the most viable portion of our business on which we should concentrate was our high reliability business operated by our electronic components group and  as a result  we focused our strategy and product lines around our core high reliability products 
in july  we acquired montena  a swiss manufacturer and marketer of ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and battery and capacitor winding equipment 
this acquisition brought us an additional power business focused on one of our key product lines  high reliability electronic components  and provided us with additional design and production capabilities that enhanced our profile as a reliable  global supplier of ultracapacitors 
in the second half of  we took a series of additional steps to intensify our focusing efforts and to exit certain non strategic businesses  as follows in september  we suspended the operations of purepulse  which had been developing pulsed light purification systems 
we continue to preserve purepulse s intellectual property for a possible future sale 
in september  we sold the computing systems business of i bus phoenix 
although that business had a strategic focus on high reliability high availability computer servers  the markets for such systems  particularly telecommunications  had deteriorated so dramatically that we concluded that near term growth prospects for our computing systems business were limited 
in september  we sold our teknaseal glass to metal seals business and in december  we sold a small power factor correction product line that did not fit our high reliability strategy 
during the third quarter of  we began integrating the power systems business of i bus phoenix into our high reliability electronics business 
during  we determined that our long term profitability goals could best be achieved by further focusing on our high margin strategy and core high reliability electronic components business  and by eliminating non core and low margin products  including our winding equipment business 
in furtherance of these goals  during we took the following steps in  we completed the integration and relocation of our power systems business into our principal manufacturing facility in san diego  california  and vacated and sold the company owned facility that formerly housed the north american operations of i bus phoenix 
this consolidation allowed more efficient use of our remaining facilities and personnel  and the sale of the vacated facility provided us with additional cash resources 
also in  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance with yec 
yec is a million per annum manufacturer of electrolytic capacitors headquartered in taichung  taiwan  with manufacturing and sales operations in mainland china 
we entered into this alliance in order to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china  and to help position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors with production facilities in north america and europe  and access to facilities in asia 
in july  we announced the phase out of our electronic components tester business  which was completed as of december  and which had been part of our high reliability business segment 
in august  we announced the phase out of our magnetics based power systems products  which also had been part of our high reliability business segment  to focus our power systems expertise on development and marketing of proprietary  ultracapacitor based  multicell modules and backup power solutions 
as part of the phase out of our magnetics based power systems products  our power distribution and conditioning modules were integrated into our boostcap ultracapacitors product line 
in december  we sold our winding equipment business segment  which we had acquired through our acquisition of montena in with the completion of these actions  our remaining operations have been consolidated into our high reliability business segment  comprised of three current product lines ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and radiation mitigated microelectronics 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events  and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our consolidation activities 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if potentially adverse developments  described below as risks and uncertainties  materialize and cannot be resolved successfully 
in any such case  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also result in decreased revenues  increased expenses or other adverse impacts that could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future  which may decrease the market value of our common stock 
we have incurred net losses in our last four fiscal years 
we cannot assure you that we will become profitable in the foreseeable future  if ever 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and we may incur net losses from period to period as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to the following the amounts invested in developing  manufacturing and marketing our products in any period as compared to the volume of sales of those products in the same period  fluctuations in demand for our products by our oem customers  the prices at which we sell our products and services as compared to the prices of our competitors  the timing of our product introductions may lag behind those of our competitors  our profit margins may decrease  and any negative impacts resulting from acquisitions we have made or may make 
in addition  we incur significant costs developing and marketing products based on new technologies and  in order to increase our market share  we may sell our products at profit margins below those we ultimately expect to achieve and or significantly reduce the prices of our products and services in a particular quarter or quarters 
the impact of the foregoing may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
we may not be able to continue development of or market our products successfully  and thus may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
historically  we relied in part upon government contracts relating to our defense contracting business to fund our research and development  and we have derived a significant portion of our revenues from the government sector 
in march  we sold our defense contracting business and we now generate revenue solely from developing  manufacturing and marketing commercial products  many of which have been developed since if we are unable to continue to develop or to market our products successfully  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we have recently introduced many of our products into commercial markets and  upon such introductions  we also must demonstrate our capabilities as a reliable supplier of these products 
some of our products are alternatives to established products or provide capabilities that do not presently exist in the marketplace 
our products are sold in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets 
the success of our products is significantly affected by their cost  technology standards and end user preferences 
in addition  the success of our products depends on a number of factors  including our ability to hire and maintain an engineering and marketing staff sufficiently skilled to identify and design new products  overcome technical  financial and other risks involved in introducing new products and technologies  identify and develop attractive markets for our new products and technologies and accurately anticipate demand  develop appropriate commercial sales and distribution channels  develop and manufacture new products that we can sell at competitive prices  deliver products that meet our customers requirements for quality and reliability  increase our manufacturing capacity and improve manufacturing efficiency to meet our customer demands  successfully respond to technological changes by improving our existing products and technologies  demonstrate that our products have technological and or economic advantages over the products of our competitors  successfully respond to competitors that are more experienced  have significantly greater resources and have a larger base of customers  and secure the raw materials required at the prices necessary to manufacture and deliver competitive products 
if the supply of a commodity raw material changes or is interrupted  we may not be able to build our products or if we can build our products  we may be unable to sell our products profitably at competitive prices 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to meet potential customer demand  which could require us to change our business strategy and result in decreased profitability and a loss of customers 
we believe that in the future we will need a substantial amount of additional capital for a number of purposes  including the following to meet potential volume production requirements for several of our product lines  in particular our ultracapacitors  which require high speed automated production lines to achieve targeted customer volume and price requirements  to expand our manufacturing capabilities and develop viable out source partners and other production alternatives  to fund our continuing expansion into commercial markets and compete effectively in those markets  to achieve our long term strategic objectives  to maintain and enhance our competitive position  and to acquire new or complementary businesses  product lines and technologies 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to change or delay our planned growth which could result in decreased revenues  profits and a loss of customers 
our credit agreements contain various restrictions and covenants that limit management s discretion in the operation of our business and could limit our ability to grow and compete 
the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities contain various provisions that limit our ability to incur additional debt  make loans  pay dividends and make other distributions  create certain liens on  or sell  our assets  merge or consolidate with another corporation or entity  or enter into other transactions outside the ordinary course of business  and make certain changes in our capital structure 
these provisions restrict management s ability to operate our business in accordance with management s discretion and could limit our ability to grow and compete 
our credit agreements also require us to maintain our compliance with certain financial covenants and ratios 
if we fail to comply with any of such financial covenants or ratios  or otherwise default under our credit agreements  the lenders under such agreements could accelerate and declare all amounts borrowed to be immediately due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and or terminate their commitments  if any  to make further extensions of credit to us 
in the event that amounts due under our credit agreements are declared immediately payable  we may not have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make such accelerated payments 
we may experience difficulty manufacturing our products  which would prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share 
we may experience difficulty in manufacturing our products in increased quantities  outsourcing the manufacturing of our products and improving our manufacturing processes 
if we are unable to manufacture our products in increased quantities  or if we are unable to outsource the manufacturing of our products or improve our manufacturing processes  we may be unable to increase sales and market share for our products and could also lose existing customers 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products in high volume and  therefore  it may be difficult for us to achieve the following results increase the quantity of the new products we manufacture  especially those products that contain new technologies  reduce our manufacturing costs to a level needed to produce adequate profit margins  and design and procure additional automated manufacturing equipment 
it may also be difficult for us to solve management  technological  engineering and other problems which may arise in connection with our manufacturing processes 
these problems may include production volumes and yields  quality assurance  adequate and timely supply of materials and shortages of qualified management and other personnel 
in addition  we may elect to have some of our products manufactured by third parties 
if we outsource the manufacture of our products  we will face risks with respect to quality assurance  cost and the absence of close engineering support 
our large cell ultracapacitors designed for transportation and industrial applications may not gain widespread commercial acceptance  which will adversely impact our revenues and growth opportunities  and our overall business prospects 
we have designed our large cell ultracapacitor products primarily for use in transportation and industrial applications 
currently  most of the major automotive companies are pursuing initiatives to develop alternative power sources for cars and trucks and eventually to replace the current volt electrical system with a volt electrical system 
we believe our ultracapacitors provide an innovative alternative power solution for both of these applications  and we are currently in preliminary discussions with several major automotive companies and their suppliers with regard to designing our ultracapacitor into their future products 
however  the current per unit cost of ultracapacitors has prevented ultracapacitors from gaining widespread commercial acceptance 
in addition  there are other competing technologies such as nickel metal hydride batteries  engines using alternative fuels and competing ultracapacitors 
we believe that the long term success of our ultracapacitors will be determined by our ability to reduce the cost of production  outperform the competing technologies and to have our ultracapacitors widely designed into the next generation of the power drive trains in hybrid powered cars and trucks and the first generation of volt electrical systems 
if our ultracapacitors fail to achieve widespread commercial acceptance in this next generation of automotive products  our revenues and growth opportunities will be adversely impacted in future periods and our overall business prospects will be significantly impaired 
we may be unable to produce our large cell ultracapacitors in commercial quantities or reduce the cost of production enough to be commercially viable for widespread application which will adversely impact our revenues and growth opportunities  and our overall business prospects 
if we are not able to produce large quantities of our large cell ultracapacitors in the near future at a dramatically reduced per unit cost  our large cell ultracapacitors may not be a commercially viable alternative to traditional or other alternative energy storage and power delivery devices 
although we have already begun selling a new type of boostcap large cell ultracapacitor designed for transportation and industrial applications  we have only produced this ultracapacitor in limited quantities and at a relatively high cost as compared with traditional energy storage and power delivery devices 
we are currently investing significant resources in improving the cell design for higher performance at lower cost and in automating and scaling up our manufacturing capacity to permit us to produce this product in commercial quantities sufficient to meet the needs of our potential customers 
furthermore  we believe  based on discussions with potential customers in the automotive and transportation industry  that our ultracapacitors will not provide a commercially viable solution for our customers needs unless we are able to reduce the per unit cost dramatically below our current per unit cost 
if we are not successful in the near future in reducing our cost of production and establishing the capability to produce large quantities of ultracapacitors  we may not be able to generate commercial acceptance of  and sufficient revenue from  this product to recover our significant investment in the development and manufacturing scale up of this product and our overall business prospects will be significantly impaired 
our product lines may be subject to increased or intense competition  and this may adversely affect our ability to maintain our gross margins 
if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster than we do  or commercialize products that are superior to our products  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
the extent to which any of our products achieve market acceptance will depend on competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control 
competition in our markets is intense and has been accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
our competitors include large fully integrated electronics companies 
we may not be able to develop  fund or invest in one or more of our product lines to the same degree as our competitors do  or we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or at all 
many of these entities have substantially greater research and development capabilities and financial  manufacturing  technological  marketing and sales resources than we do  as well as more experience in research and development  product testing  manufacturing  marketing and sales 
these organizations also compete with us to attract parties for collaborations or joint ventures  license the proprietary technology that is competitive with our technology  and attract and hire scientific talent 
our competitors may succeed in developing and commercializing products earlier than we do 
our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those we are developing  and render our product candidates or technology obsolete or non competitive 
if we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products  our sales and revenue would suffer and we may not ever become profitable 
if our oem customers fail to purchase our components or to sell sufficient quantities of their products incorporating our components  or if our oem customers sales timing and volume fluctuates  it could prevent us from achieving our sales and market share goals 
sales to a relatively small number of oem customers  as opposed to direct retail sales to customers  make up virtually all of our revenues 
our ability to make sales to oem customers depends on our ability to compete effectively  primarily on price  delivery and quality 
the timing and volume of these sales depend upon the sales levels and shipping schedules for the products of our oem customers 
thus  even if we develop a successful component  our sales will not increase unless the product into which our component is incorporated is successful 
if our oem customers fail to sell a sufficient quantity of products incorporating our components  or if the oem customers sales timing and volume fluctuate  it could prevent us from achieving our sales targets and negatively impact our market share 
our oem customers typically require a long development and engineering process before incorporating our products and services into their systems and products 
this period of time is in addition to the time we spend on basic research and product development 
as a result  we are vulnerable to changes in technology or end user preferences 
our opportunity to sell our products to our oem customers typically occurs at infrequent intervals  depending on when the oem customer designs a new product or enhances an existing one 
if we are not aware of an oem s product development schedule  or if we cannot provide components or technologies when they develop their products  we may miss a sales opportunity that may not reappear for some time 
we might be faced with products liability or warranty claims  either directly or indirectly through our customers  and we have no historical experience as to our potential liability 
we offer our customers a warranty for our products 
any defects that may occur in our products could  in turn  lead to defects in our customers products that incorporate our products 
the occurrence of defects in our products could give rise to warranty claims against us or to liability for damages caused by such defects to our customers or to the customers of our customers 
such defects could also lead to liability for consequential damages  or product liability claims 
defects in our products could  moreover  impair the market s acceptance of our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we have no historical experience in evaluating the potential liability that could be created by claims under our warranty 
if the claims made under such warranty exceed expected levels against which we have reserved  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
unfavorable economic conditions in the us and abroad may adversely affect our oem customers and prevent us from achieving sales and profit growth 
many of our new products are components designed to be integrated into new products and systems to be introduced to the marketplace by our oem customers 
unfavorable economic conditions in slowed capital spending on us electric utility infrastructure and delayed the introduction of certain new products by our oem customers 
continued unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to market and sell our new products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  we could lose our competitive advantage in the industry segments in which we do business 
our success depends on establishing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  we could lose our competitive advantage in the industry segments in which we do business 
although we try to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  these steps may not prevent infringement  misappropriation or other misuse by third parties 
we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property rights under the laws of certain foreign countries  but our efforts may not be effective to the extent that foreign laws are not as protective as the laws of the us in addition  we face the possibility that third parties might reverse engineer our products to discover how they work and introduce competing products  or that third parties might independently develop products and intellectual property similar to ours 
we have increased our emphasis on protecting our technologies and products through patents 
our success depends on maintaining our patents  adding to them where appropriate  and developing products and applications without infringing the patent and proprietary rights of others 
the following risks are involved in protecting our patents our patents may be circumvented or challenged and held unenforceable or invalid  our pending or future patent applications  if any  may not be issued in a timely manner and may not provide the protections we seek  and others may claim rights in the patented and other proprietary technology that we own or license 
if our patents are invalidated or if it is determined that we  or the licensor of the patent  do not hold sole rights to the patent  we could lose our competitive advantage in the industry segments in which we do business 
competing research and patent activity in our product areas is substantial 
conflicting patent and other proprietary rights claims may result in disputes or litigation 
although we do not believe that our products or proprietary rights infringe on third party rights  infringement claims could be asserted against us in the future 
also  we may not be able to stop a third party product from infringing on our proprietary rights without litigation 
if we are subject to such claims  or if we are forced to bring such claims  we could face time consuming  costly litigation that may result in product shipment delays and possible damage payments or injunctions that could prevent us from making  using or selling infringing products 
we may also be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms as part of a judgment or settlement which could have a negative impact on the amount of revenue derived from our products or proprietary rights 
our ability to adequately license our technology may affect our success 
our growth and success will be dependent to a substantial extent on our reputation 
since we anticipate licensing our technology to others  our reputation may be affected by the performance of the companies to which we license our technology 
our licenses may grant exclusivity with respect to certain uses or geographic areas 
as a result  we will be wholly dependent on the success of the licensee for success with respect to any exclusive use or geographical area 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in granting our licenses to those who are likely to succeed 
in addition  license agreements with foreign companies may be subject to additional risks  such as exchange rate fluctuations  political instability or weaknesses in the local economy 
certain provisions of the license agreements that benefit us may be subject to restrictions in foreign laws that limit our ability to enforce those contractual provisions 
in addition  it may be more difficult to register and protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries 
our failure to obtain suitable licensees of our technology or the failure of our licensees to achieve our manufacturing or quality control standards or otherwise meet our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to enter into successful alliances or other strategic arrangements may affect our success 
we intend to enter into additional alliances in the future to sell or license our technology 
our alliance with yec is with a foreign partner and we anticipate that future alliances may be with foreign partners or entities 
as a result  such future alliances may be subject to the political climate and economies of the foreign countries where such partners reside 
we cannot assure you that our alliance partners or other partners will provide us with the support we anticipate  that any of the alliances or other relationships will be successful in developing our technology for use with their intended products  or that any of the alliances or other relationships will be successful in manufacturing and marketing their technologies for such products once developed 
any of our international operations will also be subject to certain external business risks such as exchange rate fluctuations  political instability and a significant weakening of a local economy in which a foreign entity with which we have an affiliation operates or is located 
certain provisions of the alliance agreements that are for our benefit may be subject to restrictions in foreign laws that limit our ability to enforce those contractual provisions 
failure of these alliances to be successful could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we face risks associated with the marketing  distribution and sale of our products internationally and  if we are unable to manage these risks effectively  it could impair our ability to increase sales 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the us we expect our international sales to continue to represent a significant and increasing portion of our future revenues 
as a result  our business will continue to be subject to certain risks  such as foreign government regulations  export controls  changes in tax laws  tax treaties  tariffs and freight rates 
if we are unable to manage these risks effectively  it could impair our ability to increase international sales 
we have substantial operations in switzerland 
since we are relatively inexperienced in managing our international operations  we may be unable to effectively operate and expand of our worldwide business and to manage cultural  language and legal differences inherent in international operations 
in addition  to the extent we are unable to respond to political  economic and other conditions in these countries effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws and regulations could increase our tax rates 
as a result of our international operations and related revenue generated outside of the us  the dollar amount of our revenue and expenses may be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  we could lose our technological and competitive advantage in some product areas and business segments 
since many of our products employ emerging technologies  our success depends upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel 
some of our engineers are the key developers of our products and technologies and are recognized as leaders in their area of expertise 
the loss of such engineers to our competitors could threaten our technological and competitive advantage in some product areas and business segments 
our performance also depends on our ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel  especially key operations executives and highly skilled engineers 
the industries in which we compete are characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time 
our ability to increase market share and sales depends on our ability to hire  train and retain qualified marketing and sales personnel 
because many of our products are new  we have limited experience marketing and selling them 
to sell our products  our marketing and sales personnel must demonstrate the advantages of our products over the products offered by our competitors  and we must be able to demonstrate the value of new technology in order to sell new products to existing and new customers 
the highly technical nature of the products we offer requires that we attract and retain qualified marketing and sales personnel  and we may have difficulty doing that in a highly competitive employment market 
also  as part of our sales and marketing strategy  we enter into arrangements with distributors and sales representatives and depend upon their efforts to sell our products 
our arrangements with outside distributors and sales representatives may not be successful 
if we are unable to secure qualified and adequate sources for our materials  components and sub assemblies  we may not be able to make our products at competitive costs and we may have difficulty meeting customer demand  which could damage our relationships with our customers 
our ability to manufacture products depends in part on our ability to secure qualified and adequate sources of materials  components and sub assemblies at prices that enable us to make our products at competitive costs 
some of our suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more items that we need to manufacture our products 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  the partial or complete loss of these sources could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our business and results of operations  and damage customer relationships 
upon occasion  we have experienced difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of supplies from outside suppliers  which has adversely affected our delivery time to our customers 
there can be no assurance that such supply problems will not recur 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent certain transactions and could make a takeover more difficult 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of maxwell  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we have a staggered board of directors  which means that our directors are divided into three classes 
the directors in each class are elected to serve three year terms 
since the three year terms of each class overlap the terms of the other classes of directors  the entire board of directors cannot be replaced in any one year 
furthermore  our certificate of incorporation contains a fair price provision which may require a potential acquirer to obtain the consent of our board to any business combination involving maxwell 
we have adopted a program under which our stockholders have rights to purchase our stock directly from us at a below market price if a company or person attempts to buy us without negotiating with the board 
this program is intended to encourage a buyer to negotiate with us  but may have the effect of discouraging offers from possible buyers 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  deter or prevent a merger  tender offer  or other business combination or change in control involving us that some  or a majority  of our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
this includes offers or attempted takeovers that could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock 
our common stock experiences limited trading volume and our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
the trading volume of our common stock each day is relatively low 
this means that sales or purchases of relatively small blocks of stock can have a significant impact on the price at which our stock is traded 
we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results  announcements of new technologies impacting our products  announcements by competitors or changes in securities analysts recommendations could cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions such as recessions or higher interest rates  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

dividend policy we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock 
we currently anticipate that any earnings will be retained for the development and expansion of our business and  therefore  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  under our bank credit agreements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may  directly or indirectly  pay any cash dividends to our stockholders 
recent sales of unregistered securities on september   we issued a total of  shares of common stock to montena sa  a swiss corporation  as part of the consideration for all of the outstanding shares of montena sa s subsidiary corporation  montena components ltd 
the shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by regulation s promulgated under the securities act

overview maxwell technologies  inc is a delaware corporation originally incorporated in under the name maxwell laboratories  inc in  we changed our name to maxwell technologies  inc presently headquartered in san diego  california  we are a developer and manufacturer of innovative  cost effective energy storage and power delivery solutions 
maxwell s high reliability business segment is comprised of three product lines ultracapacitors our primary product  ultracapacitors  includes our boostcap ultracapacitor cells and multi cell modules and powercache backup power systems  which provide highly reliable power solutions for applications in consumer and industrial electronics  transportation and telecommunications 
high voltage capacitors our condis high voltage grading and coupling capacitors are used in electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electrical energy 
radiation mitigated microelectronic products our radiation mitigated microelectronic products include power modules  memory modules and single board computers for applications in the space and satellite industries 
we aim to design and manufacture our products to perform reliably for the life of the products and systems into which they are integrated 
we seek to achieve high reliability through the application of proprietary technologies and rigorously controlled design  development  manufacturing and test processes 
this high reliability strategy emphasizes the development and marketing of products that enable us to achieve higher profit margins than commodity electronic components and systems 
during the year ended december   we continued our efforts to focus our business and to exit non strategic businesses 
these efforts culminated in our exit from the low margin power magnetics business and commensurate consolidation of the remaining value added business into our ultracapacitor product line  and the sale of our winding equipment business segment 
as the result of these actions  as well as other divestitures throughout and  we have consolidated our operations into our high reliability business segment 
see part i  item business strategic consolidation of operations  part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events and notes and to our notes to consolidated financial statements  for information regarding our business combinations  divestitures and phased out operations 
highlights partially as a result of the efforts we began in to re focus on our core product lines and to exit non strategic businesses  we reduced our loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  to million  or per diluted share  from a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  during  we took several steps to intensify our focus on our high reliability  high margin strategy and to eliminate non core and low margin products  including in  we completed the integration and relocation of our power systems business into our principal manufacturing facility in san diego  california  and vacated and later sold the company owned facility that formerly housed the north american operations of i bus phoenix 
this consolidation allowed more efficient use of our remaining facilities and personnel  and the sale of the vacated facility provided us with additional cash resources 
also in  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance with yec 
yec is a million per annum manufacturer of electrolytic capacitors headquartered in taichung  taiwan  with manufacturing and sales operations in mainland china 
we entered into this alliance in order to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china and to help position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors with production facilities in north america and europe  and access to facilities in asia 
in july  we announced the phase out of our electronic components tester business  which was completed as of december  and which business had been part of our high reliability business segment 
in august  we announced the phase out of our magnetics based power systems products  which also had been part of our high reliability segment  to focus our power systems expertise on development and marketing of proprietary  ultracapacitor based  multicell modules and backup power solutions 
as part of the phase out of our magnetics based power systems products  our power distribution and conditioning modules were integrated into our boostcap ultracapacitors product line 
in december  we sold our winding equipment business segment  which we had acquired via our acquisition of montena in with the completion of these actions  our remaining operations have been consolidated into our high reliability business segment  which is now comprised of three current product lines ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and radiation mitigated microelectronics 
see part i  item business strategic consolidation of operations  part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our consolidation activities 
outlook we completed the restructuring and re focusing of our business as of december  a process we began in late as the result of our efforts  we have reduced our quarterly break even revenue threshold from more than million at the beginning of  to less than million anticipated for the first quarter of this was done through a combination of downsizing and cost reduction  increases in productivity and the reduction of low margin products 
we entered fiscal year with cash reserves of more than million 
with the continuing growth of our ultracapacitor business and focus on high margin products  we expect to become profitable by the end of the second half of by maintaining our capital expenditures to depreciation ratio  we expect to also become cash flow neutral 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in our outlook are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward looking statements 
our future financial condition and results of operations  as well as any forward looking statements  are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties 
some  but not necessarily all  of the factors impacting these risks and uncertainties are set forth in part i  item business risk factors 
business segments consistent with our commitment to maintain maxwell as a leading developer and manufacturer of highly reliable  innovative and cost effective energy storage and power delivery solutions  during we completed the divestiture and phase out of our electronic components tester business  magnetic based power systems products and winding equipment business segment 
we are currently focused on our remaining high reliability business segment  which is comprised of three product lines ultracapacitors our primary product  ultracapacitors  includes our boostcap ultracapacitor cells and multi cell modules and powercache backup power systems  which provide highly reliable power solutions for applications in consumer and industrial electronics  transportation and telecommunications 
high voltage capacitors our condis high voltage grading and coupling capacitors are used in electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electrical energy 
radiation mitigated microelectronic products our radiation mitigated microelectronic products include power modules  memory modules and single board computers for applications in the space and satellite industries 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue total revenue for the year ended december  was approximately million including approximately million in license fees received from yec in exchange for a right to manufacture our boostcap ultracapacitors in china 
the license fee is a one time event and is shown as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
product revenue which excludes the yec licensee fees for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   which was a reduction of approximately million  or 
the reduction was attributed mainly to our i bus computing systems business  which was sold in the third quarter of and  therefore  did not generate any revenue for the year ended december  increase in revenue from our flagship product  boostcap ultracapacitors  was offset by a reduction in revenue from microelectronic products 
segment revenue high reliability for the year ended december   revenue from our high reliability business segment was million compared to million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of approximately million  or 
most of the decrease in revenue was from reduced sales of radiation mitigated microelectronics products due to the downturn in the telecommunication industry and from the power systems products  as we phased out our low margin transformer business 
winding equipment for the year ended december   revenue from our winding equipment business segment was million compared to million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of approximately million  or 
for the year ended december   revenue from this segment only covers the six month period from our acquisition of montena in july through year end december  we determined that our winding equipment business segment was not adding value to the company in terms of margin contribution  technological advances  improvement in market share or contributing to improvements in economies of scale 
therefore  this segment of our business was sold at the end of december we reported the results of operations of the winding equipment product line as continuing operations because of our continued involvement therewith 
i bus computing systems our i bus computing systems business was sold in september and did not generate any revenue in the year ended december  for the year ended december   revenue from our i bus computing systems business was approximately million 
teknaseal for the year ended december   revenue from the teknaseal glass to metal seals business was million 
the teknaseal glass to metal seals business was sold in september no revenue was generated for the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december   our cost of sales was million compared to million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was attributable primarily to our disposition and phase out activities in total operating expenses operating expenses vs

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an improvement of million  or 
the decrease in losses was primarily attributable to the disposition and phase out of operations which were unprofitable 
the loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  includes  in income from the sale of our teknaseal glass to metal seals business which is reflected in gain loss on sale of operations in income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  includes a curtailment and settlement gain of million 
under swiss law  the pension plan for our swiss employees must be managed by an entity that is legally separate from the company 
however  according to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 we are required to recognize the gain or loss of the pension fund on our balance sheet and income statement 
regardless of the fact that the pension plan is over funded  we are obliged to continue contributing to it at a rate mandated by swiss law 
as a result  the defined benefit accounting treatment may create a distorted picture of our balance sheet and financial results for the year ended december  and in future periods 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes without the pension benefit would have been million 
high reliability business segment operating losses were million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory reserves for our power systems business  as we phased out the magnetics portion of our power systems business 
provision benefit for income taxes our tax benefit for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an improvement of  or 
the benefit consists primarily of foreign income tax benefit recorded by our subsidiary  maxwell technologies sa

the reduction was attributed mainly to the sale of non core business subsidiaries  including our non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business 
in addition  the economic slow down  which started in  negatively impacted our i bus computing systems business  which continued to decline in segment revenue high reliability for the year ended december   revenue from our high reliability business segment was million compared to million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of  or 
the acquisition of montena in july  which contributed an million increase in revenue  and modest increases in sales of radiation mitigated microelectronics and boostcap ultracapacitors was offset by a decrease in sales of power systems products in the medical imaging equipment market 
winding equipment our winding equipment business segment was acquired in july as part of our acquisition of montena and thus did not impact our revenue for the year ended december  revenue for the six month period ended december  was million 
i bus computing systems for the year ended december   revenue from our i bus computing systems business was approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million  or 
we sold the i bus computing systems business in september although the computing systems business was focused on high reliability  high availability computer servers  the markets for such systems  particularly telecommunications  deteriorated dramatically during the year  which negatively impacted results of operations

acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures  discontinued operations and other events acquisitions in july  we acquired montena components ltd  a provider of ultracapacitors and high voltage capacitors to oem customers and automated winding equipment used to produce capacitors and lithium batteries  for approximately million in cash and million shares of maxwell common stock 
this acquisition brought us an additional high reliability power business focused on ultracapacitors and high voltage capacitors and additional design and production capabilities that enhanced our profile as a reliable  global supplier 
see divestitures below for a discussion of our disposition of the winding equipment business  which we acquired through our acquisition of montena 
restructuring restructuring charges were million for the year ended december  there were no restructuring charges for the year ended december  in  the restructuring charges were primarily attributable to restructuring of our i bus computing systems business and our actions to position that business for sale 
in the first half of  i bus phoenix introduced new applied computing products that had been developed in however  the market for applied computing products  particularly in telecommunications  deteriorated throughout we responded to the poor market conditions for computing systems and other capital goods by restructuring i bus phoenix 
in june  we began implementing the restructuring plan and recorded restructuring charges of  in addition  we also determined that certain components in inventory had been adversely impacted 
accordingly  we recorded an inventory charge of approximately million for certain excess and obsolete raw material components and finished goods 
this charge is included in cost of sales 
during the third quarter of  we decided to sell the applied computing business of i bus phoenix to a new company organized by former i bus phoenix senior managers 
in preparation for the sale and to configure the i bus phoenix computing business to be self supporting  i bus phoenix consolidated all production of the applied computing products in its facility in tangmere  united kingdom  and reduced personnel worldwide 
as a result of these actions  we recorded additional restructuring charges of  during the quarter ended september  the unpaid restructuring balance of  at december  was paid in divestitures in june  we sold our sierra kd emi filter and ceramic capacitor business for million in cash 
we retained accounts receivable as of the acquisition date  which amounted to million 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a net pre tax gain of million on that sale for the year ended december  in september  we sold the i bus computing systems business for million in debt and certain other considerations 
we also incurred million in charges related to goodwill impairment and other asset write downs related to that business 
the loss on the disposition totaled million as we fully reserved for the note due to risks of collectability 
in september  we also sold our non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business for million in cash  of which million was held in an escrow account and subsequently released to us over the succeeding four calendar quarters 
approximately  of the million proceeds were paid to certain former employees of teknaseal 
we recorded a net gain of  in the fourth quarter of and recorded additional gains of  for the year ended december  gain loss on sale of businesses was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in june  we decided to discontinue marketing and supporting our electronic components tester business and recorded charges in cost of sales of  primarily attributable to excess inventory and equipment   primarily attributable to warranty buy outs  and  primarily attributable to expected future warranty returns in the quarters ended june   september  and december   respectively 
sales for our electronic components tester business were immaterial in all periods presented 
in december  we sold our former i bus manufacturing and administrative facility in san diego 
the facility was previously classified as assets held for sale at its book value of million 
proceeds from the sale of the facility were million  resulting in a gain of million after payment of a loan balance with comerica bank and closing costs of  which was recorded in gain on sale of property and equipment 
in december  maxwell technologies sa our swiss subsidiary formerly known as montena components ltd 
sold all of the fixed assets  substantially all inventory  and all warranty and employee agreement obligations of its winding equipment business  located in matran  switzerland  to metar sa  a new company formed by the former ceo of montena components and metar employees 
the business was sold for  and we recognized a net loss of  discontinued operations our government systems business and purepulse are reported as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in march  we sold our government systems business for million and recorded a gain of million  net of a million provision mainly related to ongoing lease obligations 
as of december   the remaining lease obligation  which expires in april  is million with a reserve provision of  in september  purepulse suspended operations and we recorded non cash charges of approximately million and cash charges of approximately million for severance and other charges 
purepulse had been designing and developing systems that generate extremely intense  broad spectrum  pulsed light to purify water and inactivate viruses and other pathogens that contaminate vaccines and products sourced from human or animal tissues  such as plasma derivatives  transfusion blood components and biopharmaceuticals 
although purepulse raised million of equity capital from millipore and maxwell in march  the venture capital and other equity markets deteriorated after that time and purepulse was not able to raise additional capital to fund its operations 
loss from operations of these discontinued businesses was million for the year ended december  included in the loss is a charge to the tax provision of million for recording a valuation allowance 
other events an investment impairment of  was recorded in related to maxwell s ownership of approximately of a privately held company involved in support services in the areas of information technology  system and software integration and engineering and technical services under contract with various government agencies 
upon review of its annual financial statements and discussions with its chief financial offer  we were informed that the company had a negative net worth and had decided to restructure its operations to discontinue its information technology and software integration and engineering businesses and focus only on government contracting 
based on these facts and the uncertainty surrounding its ability to return to profitability  we concluded that the investment was impaired and we fully reserved for the investment 
amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december  in connection with the adoption of sfas  the amortization of goodwill was discontinued beginning with fiscal year in  we made an assessment of the company s goodwill and intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment 
accordingly  no goodwill impairments were recognized for the year ended december  goodwill impairments were million for the year ended december  there was no goodwill impairment recognized for the year ended december  we received  from the sale of the privately held company referred to above  of which  had previously been recorded by us as investment 
in  we recovered  of the  recorded as impaired in and reflected in gain loss on sale of business 
amortization of other intangibles was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   and relates to the amortization of customer backlog acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of montena and the amortization of ultracapacitor intellectual property that was recorded in conjunction with the merger of the electronic components group  a majority owned subsidiary  into maxwell after the purchase of all shares not already owned by us 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we acquired all of the outstanding minority interests  including stock options  of our majority owned subsidiaries  except for purepulse see discontinued operations above  in exchange for shares and options in maxwell 
interest income expense  net was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we used proceeds from the sale of businesses to pay down debt and the excess was invested in high quality short term marketable investments 
fixed asset impairments were million for the year ended december  impairment charges recorded in were related to fixed assets associated with the i bus computing systems business that were abandoned  and computers and computer systems infrastructure directly related to supporting the i bus computing systems business 
the impairment also included fixed assets associated with transformer and harness production for the i bus phoenix power systems group 
production of transformers and harnesses subsequently was outsourced 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million in for the year ended december  the use of cash for the year ended december  was primarily attributed to operating losses 
for the year ended december   the use of cash primarily was attributable to operating losses  including restructuring related cash expenses for our continuing operations  which for most of included the i bus computing systems business 
cash used in discontinued operations  which included purepulse and residual leases and other obligations of divested businesses  in the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the year ended december  capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we spent over million in capital investments to build and outfit state of the art production facilities  which include both mechanization and full scale automation 
in  cash of million was used in the company s third quarter as part of the purchase price for montena 
capital expenditures for are not expected to exceed million  which is approximately equal to our annual depreciation and amortization charges 
our restructuring plan which started in early was completed in  and we started realizing the benefit of our restructuring effort in the fourth quarter of all indicators such as productivity  lower product cost and new product introduction have increased 
the reduction of overhead and increased productivity should improve our gross margin and reduce our operating expenses in based on our current plan  we believe we will generate positive cash flow from operations for the year ending december  in january  we secured a million line of credit from a us bank that is available for working capital needs  the line has not been used to date 
we also have a line of credit for million from a swiss bank for working capital in switzerland 
the line has been fully used as of december  we had million in cash and million in short term investments at the end of december we also have a  term loan available from a swiss bank for capital equipment purchases 
we have a loan from the employee pension fund in the amount of approximately  we believe the liquidity provided by the existing cash and cash equivalents  as well as the cash generated from operations and available under our lines of credit  will provide sufficient capital to fund our capital equipment and working capital requirements and potential operating losses for more than the next months 
failure to achieve expected cash flows or to obtain additional debt or equity investments  if necessary  would have a material adverse effect on us 
net accounts receivable decreased to million as of december  from million at december  the primary reasons for the decrease was due to lower revenues and improvement in the collection cycle 
net inventory balance decreased to million as of december  from million as of december this reduction is due to improved inventory management and the increase in inventory reserves due to the phase out of our tester and magnetic based power products 
inventory reserves as of december   were million compared to million as of december  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of december  were million compared to million as of december  the primary reason for the reduction was lower inventory purchases and a decrease in operating expenses 
short term borrowing increased to million as of december  from  as of december  net liability of discontinued operations as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
during and  we financed operating losses with term debt  as described under the heading short term and long term borrowings  and the sale of non strategic businesses 
in the year ended december   we received million and million of cash in connection with the sale of sierra kd emi  our filter and ceramic capacitor business  and government systems  our defense contracting business  respectively 
these funds were used to pay down debt of million and to fund continuing and discontinued operations 
on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter of  we sold teknaseal  our glass to metal seals business  and received approximately million net cash  of which million was held in an escrow account and was later paid upon teknaseal achieving certain revenue benchmarks in we used a portion of these proceeds to prepay million of our bank term loan  which reduced the outstanding term loan to million 
the term loan was paid off in full in december maxwell technologies sa requires advances from customers for certain product lines and issues bank guarantees that give the customer the right to receive back the advance if the product is not delivered by a specific date 
as of the end of december  we had issued guarantees of  related to these product arrangements  most of which we expect to ship to customers in the first quarter of during the quarter ended september  we suspended the operations of purepulse  sold the i bus computing systems business and started consolidating our power systems business and corporate headquarters into our leased facility in san diego  which also contains  in part  our ultracapacitor and microelectronics businesses 
we also decided to offer for sale our  square foot owned facility that housed i bus phoenix s computing systems north american operations and administration 
these actions  combined with the acquisition of montena  are consistent with our strategy to focus on high value  high reliability power and microelectronic products and to structure the company s operations to be self supporting on product revenues in the near future 
the former i bus phoenix facility was sold in december short term and long term borrowings short term borrowings maxwell s european subsidiary  maxwell technologies sa  has a million bank credit agreement with a swiss bank 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at plus 
for every quarter borrowings are outstanding 
under the credit agreement  we are eligible to borrow fixed term loans at libor plus with repayment terms extending beyond one month from the date of funding 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by the assets of maxwell technologies sa 
as of december   the full amount of the credit line was drawn 
in addition   of letters of guarantee were outstanding as of december  related to customer deposits 
in february  we secured a million credit line from a us bank for working capital purposes  subject to a one year repayment period

this credit agreement bears interest at the swiss inter bank borrowing rate plus 
the term loan can be borrowed in quarterly advances up to the  limit and repaid over one to five years 
if funds were borrowed at the beginning of and repaid over a year period  the interest rate would be 
maxwell sa had a loan from the montena sa pension plan for  swiss francs or  at december  and december  the loan from the pension plan bears interest at the variable mortgage rate of the banque cantonale de fribourg plus  which resulted in a interest rate for in february  we entered into a loan and security agreement with comerica bank california 
the loan and security agreement  as amended  consisted of a million credit line secured by a deed on the i bus phoenix facility in san diego  as well as certain other collateral 
the term loan bore interest  at our option  at the bank s reference rate plus  or cost of funds plus 
the interest rate was at december  the principal was amortized monthly over years with the balance due december  the amount of the loan was paid in full in december with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the i bus phoenix facility 
minority equity interests in subsidiaries and subsidiary option programs in january  we adopted a plan to complete merger transactions between maxwell  our electronic components group and our i bus phoenix subsidiary whereby all of the minority shareholdings and options in such subsidiaries would be converted to shares and options of maxwell 
on april   these merger transactions resulted in the issuance of  common shares of maxwell and options to purchase  common shares of maxwell 
in february  pacificorp energy ventures  inc  the largest minority shareholder in the electronic components group  exchanged its preferred shares of the electronic components group for  common shares of maxwell pursuant to its right under the original investment agreement 
purepulse  which is classified as discontinued operations  has minority equity investors 
these investors are former strategic partners  former employees who were issued shares when purepulse originally was incorporated and former employees who have exercised stock options in that entity 
as of december   minority investors owned approximately of the outstanding stock of purepulse 
loss on the sale of the i bus computing systems business we fully reserved for the million note received in exchange for the i bus computing systems business in september due to the uncertainty as to its collectability 
the note was discounted and cancelled in exchange for  in the fourth quarter of contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations debt obligations total operating lease obligations represent building leases and vehicle leases for management personnel at our rossens  switzerland  facility 
debt obligations represent short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as us gaap 
we have used certain assumptions and judgments in the preparation of these financial statements  which assumptions and estimates may potentially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition for the fiscal year ended december   substantially all of our revenue was derived from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers and licensing fees received for the right to manufacture our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors 
product revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped and title passes to the customer unless specific terms require otherwise 
in general no discounts are offered and there is no right of return 
license fee revenues are recognized when the performance requirements have been met  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of fees is probable 
in prior years  certain continuing and discontinued segments involved revenues from both long term and short term fixed price contracts and cost plus contracts with the us government directly or through a prime contractor 
those revenues  including estimated profits  were recognized at the time the costs were incurred and included provisions for any anticipated losses 
these contracts are subject to rate audits and other audits  which could result in the reduction of revenue in excess of estimated provisions 
in turn  this could increase losses for the periods in which any such reduction occurs 
accounts receivable we establish and maintain customer credit limits based on references  financial information  credit worthiness and payment history 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect anticipated bad debts based on past collection history and any specific risks identified in the portfolio 
we determine our bad debt reserve based on an analysis we make to measure our reserve requirements and we establish specific reserves when we recognize the inability of our customer to pay its obligation 
if we become aware of increasing negative changes in the financial condition of our customers  or if economic conditions change adversely  we may have to increase the allowance 
an increase in such allowances would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
assets held for sale and remaining lease obligation in december  we sold the building formerly occupied by i bus phoenix  inc  which was classified as assets held for sale in proceeds from the sale of the facility were approximately million and closing expenses were  resulting in a gain from the sale of the facility of million 
we have provided an estimate of the remaining liability of discontinued operations of purepulse associated with a remaining lease obligation  which has been recorded in discontinued operations 
in making this estimate  we considered factors such as the commercial real estate market  including our estimate as to how and when we will be able to sub lease  terminate or buy out the remaining lease obligation 
given the currently depressed commercial real estate markets and the continued spending reductions by businesses and government agencies  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to conclude this lease obligation for the amount that we have accrued  which could require additional charges 
excess and obsolete inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition  price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods to reflect changes in market conditions 
we believe that future events are subject to change and errors in estimates may have significant adverse impact on the balance sheet 
long lived assets and other intangible assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis of impairment involve estimates of future discounted cash flows 
we use cash flow assumptions that are consistent with our business plans and consider other relevant information 
if we determine that the carrying value of the long lived asset may not be recoverable  a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds its fair market value 
if there are changes in business circumstances or in the key assumptions used in estimating undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated  as well as the related impairment charge 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value  which was calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of their goodwill 
in assessing the implied fair value of goodwill  we have made assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows and other operating factors 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis of impairment involve estimates of revenue and expense forecasts of the reporting unit 
if there are changes in business circumstances of in the key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated  as well as the related impairment charge 
we cannot say with certainty that we may not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the fair value of maxwell technologies and maxwell sa decrease due to market conditions or other unanticipated circumstances 
we may have to revise our assumptions and incur additional charges 
any additional impairment charges will adversely affect our results of operations 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have had a recent history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof as to their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we determined that it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance as of december  against our deferred tax assets based on the recent history of losses to amounts that are expected to be more likely than not realizable 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of a tax benefit and a reduction to the company s effective tax rate 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition
