item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
overview financial condition wesco continues to have an exceptionally strong  conservatively valued balance sheet at december   with relatively little debt and no hedging or off balance sheet financing 
liquidity  which has traditionally been high  is even higher than usual due principally to sales and maturities during of most of wesco s mortgage backed securities and other fixed maturity investments and reinvestment of the proceeds in cash equivalents pending redeployment 
wesco s four equity investees are strong  well known companies 
the practice of concentrating in few issues  rather than diversifying  follows the investment philosophy of the chairmen ceos of wesco and its parent  berkshire  who consult with respect to wesco s investments and major capital allocations 
results of operations investment gains were realized in for the first time in three years 
as is usual for wesco  realization of these gains had little effect on shareholders equity  because the gains had essentially been reflected  net of taxes  in the unrealized appreciation component of shareholders equity 
sales of investments at wesco are made with a view to economics  never the reporting of earnings  and the amounts and timing of realizations have no predictive or practical analytic value 

table of contents ignoring realized investment gains  after tax operating earnings declined in after remaining relatively flat in and improved insurance underwriting results were more than offset by reduced investment income that resulted from the shift from longer term to very short term fixed maturity investments bearing lower interest rates 
also  the furniture rental and industrial segments suffered from the effects of the ongoing weak economy and other unfavorable factors 
wesco does not manage with a view toward wall street expectations 
its management is not concerned with the volatility of short term operating results  so long as long term prospects are satisfactory 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  up from billion per share at december  shareholders equity included million at december   and million at december   representing appreciation in market value of investments  which is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded based upon market quotations  gains or losses ultimately realized upon sale of investments could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation 
net unrealized appreciation constituted approximately of shareholders equity at december  and at december  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  as well as notes and to wesco s accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on investments 
at december   wesco s consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled billion  up from million at december  the million increase resulted primarily from sales  maturities and early redemptions of longer term fixed income securities as well as operating cash flow from wesco s insurance businesses 
wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  of these amounts  million and million related to a million revolving line of credit used in cort s furniture rental business 
the remainder represented convertible notes of a subsidiary of cort  which were in effect retired during see note to wesco s consolidated financial statements 
wesco s management believes the group has adequate liquidity and capital resources to provide for contingent needs 
borrowings from banks and others have been available to wesco and its subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years 
wes fic enjoys standard poor s corporation s highest rating  aaa  with respect to its claims paying ability 
results of operations the consolidated data in the second table in item are set forth essentially in the income statement format customary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenues  including realized net securities gains  are followed by costs and expenses  including goodwill amortization if applicable and a provision for income taxes  to arrive at net income 
the following summary sets forth the after tax contribution to gaap net income of each business segment insurance  furniture rental and industrial as well as activities not considered related to such segments 
realized net securities gains and goodwill amortization are excluded from segment activities  consistent with the way wesco s management views the business operations 
amounts are in thousands  all after income tax effect

insurance segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the insurance segment ie  wes fic and kbs  which represent the combination of underwriting results with dividend and interest income 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  premiums written premiums earned underwriting gain loss dividend and interest income income before income taxes income tax provision segment net income premiums written for  and included million  million and million attributable to wes fic  and million  million and million attributable to kbs 
earned premiums for  and included million  million and million attributable to wes fic  and million  million and million attributable to kbs 
at december   wes fic was participating in in force reinsurance business principally as follows a multi year contract for property and casualty exposure entered into in with a large  unaffiliated insurer  and a contract which became effective in under which wes fic participates in various pools of aviation related risks 
under the first contract described above  wes fic  in  and  wrote premiums of approximately million annually and earned premiums of million  million and million 
under the second contract described above  wes fic  in  and  wrote million  million and million and earned premiums of million  million and million 
wes fic s participation in those contracts has generally varied from year to year  and is summarized in item  business 
the decrease in premiums written by kbs in resulted from a change in the pricing of reinsurance ceded to reinsurers  premiums written  before the purchase of reinsurance  actually increased slightly for the year  as it did in the increases in premiums written by kbs in recent years have been principally 
table of contents due to growth in volume of bank deposit guarantee bonds  this product currently accounts for approximately of premiums written by kbs 
the underwriting gain loss for  and included million  
million  and million attributable to wes fic  and million  million and million attributable to kbs 
wes fic benefited in mainly from relatively low levels of aviation losses 
its underwriting loss for resulted mainly from a provision of million before income taxes representing estimated loss and expenses related to the terrorist activity of september  its underwriting gain in benefited by a reduction of million in that provision 
aside from the million benefit  wes fic s underwriting results for were detrimentally affected by net revisions of estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses provided for in prior years of million 
underwriting results for and included net beneficial revisions of estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses of 
million and million 
underwriting results are based on estimates and subject to estimation error  in addition  management believes that it will take years to resolve complicated coverage issues relating to the september  loss estimate  which could have a material effect on the ultimate loss incurred 
kbs  unlike wes fic  writes numerous  relatively small insurance policies  and thus management considers overall combined ratios the sum of insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses divided by premiums to be meaningful 
kbs combined ratios were  and for  and since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
as explained in item  business  in spite of partial relief provided by the terrorism risk insurance act  enacted in november  wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
another industry concern in recent years has been its exposure to loss from environmental contamination  particularly asbestos related claims 
wes fic s management currently believes such exposure to be minimal 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on earnings retained and reinvested by wes fic  on capital contributed by wesco  and on float funds invested pending payment of claims 
dividend and interest income earned by the insurance segment declined for from the corresponding figure principally as proceeds from sales  maturities and early redemptions of higher yielding  long term investments were reinvested in lower yielding  short term investments 
dividend and interest income was essentially unchanged in from the amount earned in the income tax provision of the insurance segment fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income from year to year during the period presented in the foregoing table mainly due to the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
as explained in item  business  wesco s insurance segment has extraordinary capital strength  and wesco would welcome additional attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  or acquisitions of insurance businesses 
however  the timing and magnitude of changes in its insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted

excluding rental revenues each year from trade shows  as well as from locations not in operation throughout each year  rental revenues for declined approximately from those of  following a decline of approximately the prior year  the percentage decrease would have been greater were it not for the effect of price increases of to in and the number of furniture leases in effect has been on a downward trend since late units of furniture rented were down approximately in and in  as compared with each respective prior year s 
the declines of furniture rentals in dollars and units are deemed to have resulted from continued weakness of job growth in the economy  exacerbated by the terrorist activity on september  furniture sales revenues decreased in from those reported in after having increased in by over the level 
cort  in managing the level of excess  idle inventory  periodically discounts selling prices 
it did so in  resulting in higher than normal revenues 
apartment locator fees  generated by relocation central since its start up in january  increased sharply to million in from million in and million in  principally through acquisitions 
cost of rentals  sales and fees amounted to of revenues for versus for and for the decrease in cost percentage for reflected improved rental and selling prices  as well as lower depreciation expense  in spite of a writedown of obsolete and excess inventories by million in the increase in cost percentage in reflected mainly cort s efforts to trim excess  idle inventories through decreases in selling prices and would have been somewhat higher were it not for a decrease in depreciation expense 
purchases of new product have been generally declining in recent years  rental furniture is depreciated under the declining balance method  whereby recorded depreciation is higher in the first year and declines in each successive year

income or loss before income taxes and minority interest for the furniture rental segment amounted to a loss of million for the year  income of million for and income of million for eliminating the portion of these amounts representing relocation central losses million in  million in and million in results in income before income taxes and minority interest for cort  at the parent company level  of million for  million for and million for the year to year decline in the latter figures was due to the fact that cort s operating and other costs and expenses  principally fixed  were not sufficiently reduced to compensate for decreasing revenues 
management expects that the furniture rental business will improve in principally as a result of continued cost cutting and recent implementation of new rental programs 
the minority interest in net loss of relocation central of million in relates to a period of several months during which minority shareholders held an approximately equity interest in relocation central

industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services income before income taxes income tax provision benefit segment net income loss industrial segment revenues for decreased from the corresponding figure  pounds of steel products sold decreased 
revenues for increased 
from the corresponding figure  pounds of steel products sold increased 
the increase in steel sales in terms of pounds sold in may have been anomalous  because in recent years precision steel has suffered from a prolonged economic downturn  a shift by many manufacturers from domestic to overseas production facilities  periodic shortages of product from domestic mills  and extraordinary competitive pressures 
not only has there been a reduction in the number of orders placed  but there has also been a trend towards smaller sized orders 
the severity of these adverse factors on industrial segment revenues is demonstrated by the fact that average annual segment revenues for the years through were down from those reported for through at the start of  a shortage of raw materials from domestic mills has produced near chaos in the steel service industry 
thus far in  the impact on revenues and earnings has been favorable for precision steel  but it is not clear how the situation will work out 

table of contents federal and state environmental agencies have made claims relating to alleged contamination of soil and groundwater against precision brand  a subsidiary of precision steel  and various other businesses situated in a business park in downers grove  illinois 
precision brand  along with the other businesses  has been negotiating remedial actions with various governmental entities 
in addition  precision brand and other parties have been named in several civil lawsuits  including lawsuits by and on behalf of area residents  relating to this matter 
precision steel and precision brand have notified their insurers relative to the claims and litigation 
inasmuch as the claims and lawsuits are in early stages of development  the ultimate cost of the claims  including defense costs  is difficult to estimate at this time 
nevertheless  in  precision brand recorded a provision of million 
million after income tax benefit  representing a preliminary estimate of its share of costs of remediation agreed to with governmental entities and other parties to date and related expenses 
management does not anticipate that the ultimate financial impact of such remediation and other legal matters will be material in relation to wesco s shareholders equity  although it believes that the effect on consolidated net income in any given period could be material 
even without the million provision for remediation in discussed above  operations of the industrial segment for would have resulted in a loss before income taxes of 
million  versus pre tax income of 
million and 
million for and income or loss before income taxes of the industrial segment is dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating costs and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
lifo inventory accounting adjustments were insignificant in relation to industrial segment after tax loss for  but increased earnings by 
million and 
million for and unrelated to business segment operations set forth below is a summary of items increasing decreasing wesco s consolidated net income that are viewed by management as unrelated to the operations of the insurance  furniture rental and industrial segments 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  goodwill amortization  before income tax effect income tax benefit goodwill amortization realized investment gains  before income tax effect income tax provision realized investment gains other nonsegment items rental income from commercial real estate dividend and interest income real estate and general and administrative expenses interest expense other items  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income from other nonsegment activities 
table of contents goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of identified net assets of acquired businesses 
in the case of the wesco group  it relates to the acquisitions of cort and kbs  as well as smaller entities acquired by cort following its purchase by wesco in february prior to  goodwill was amortized mainly on a straight line basis over years 
effective as of the beginning of  wesco discontinued amortization of goodwill and became subject to other changes in goodwill accounting  as required by the financial accounting standards board 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill accounting 
realized gains and losses on the wesco group s investments have fluctuated in amount from year to year  sometimes impacting net income significantly  as in and however  the amounts and timing of these realizations have no predictive or practical analytical value 
wesco s investments are carried at market value  and unrealized gains or losses are reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity 
when gains or losses are realized  due to sale of securities or other triggering event  they are credited or charged to the consolidated statement of income  generally  in wesco s case  there has been little effect on total shareholders equity essentially only a transfer from unrealized appreciation to retained earnings 
wesco s consolidated earnings contained net realized investment gains  after income taxes  of million in and million in  no gains or losses were realized in or other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
these taxes do not correlate well with total pre tax income  primarily because dividend income is substantially tax exempt 
wesco s effective consolidated income tax rate typically fluctuates somewhat from period to period based mainly on the relation of dividend income  which is substantially exempt from income taxes  to other pre tax earnings or losses  including realized investment gains  which are fully taxable 
the respective income tax provisions  expressed as percentages of income before income taxes  amounted to  and in  and see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
investments may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of investment gains and losses  as well as other unusual nonoperating items such as a large acquisition 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions such as the september  terrorist activity  which had an immediate impact on wes fic s underwriting results  the ongoing weakness of the economy  which has adversely affected cort and precision steel  and raw material shortages which have very recently disrupted the steel service business 
as explained in item  business  in spite of relief provided by enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act tria on november   wes fic is exposed to losses from terrorist events covered by tria occurring after that date as well as terrorism losses not covered by tria 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to terrorism losses cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholder s equity would likely be 
table of contents severely impacted by any terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent that unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 
critical accounting policies and practices wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the significant accounting policies and practices followed by wesco are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are the accounting policies and practices considered by wesco s management to be critical to its determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions based on evaluation of facts and circumstances using information currently available 
although the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available  wesco s management does not believe such differences would have a material adverse effect on reported shareholders equity 
liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses as of any balance sheet date represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of that date  some incurred claims have not yet been reported and some of these may not be reported for many years  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for these claims 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of income after deducting estimates of amounts that will be recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding companies of their obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance contracts 
goodwill of acquired businesses represents the difference between purchase cost and the fair value of net assets of acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method 
prior to  goodwill from each acquisition was generally amortized as a charge to earnings over a period not exceeding years  and was reviewed for impairment if conditions were identified that indicated possible impairment 
effective january   wesco adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminated the periodic amortization of goodwill in favor of an accounting model that is based solely upon impairment tests 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment using a variety of methods at least annually  and impairments  if any  are charged to operating earnings 
the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading  and  when neither of those 
table of contents classifications is applicable  available for sale 
in recent years wesco s management has classified all of its equity and fixed maturity investments as available for sale  they are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of deemed applicable income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
insurance premiums are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring premiums are deferred in other assets on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  and charged to income as the premiums are earned 
furniture rentals are recognized as revenue proportionately over the rental contact period  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on the consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards or excessive  for sale 
it is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
forward looking statements certain written or oral representations of management stated in this annual report or elsewhere constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as contrasted with statements of historical fact 
forward looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature  or which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or which include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  may  or could  or which involve hypothetical events 
forward looking statements are based on information currently available and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those characterized as being likely or possible to occur 
such statements should be considered judgments only  not guarantees  and wesco s management assumes no duty  nor has it any specific intention  to update them 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
the principal important risk factors that could cause wesco s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  changes in market prices of wesco s significant equity investments  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events such as acts of terrorism  hurricanes  or other events that cause losses insured by wesco s insurance subsidiaries  changes in insurance laws or regulations  changes in income tax laws or regulations  and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of investment securities or the industries in which wesco and its affiliates do business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
otherwise  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize stand alone derivatives to manage market risks 

table of contents equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of marketable equity securities stated at market value  up from million one year earlier 
the increase was due to an increase in market values  no marketable equity securities were purchased or sold during the carrying values of wesco s equity securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the equity portfolio 
at december   two investments comprised of the carrying value of the consolidated equity portfolio 
in addition  the businesses represented by the equity investments are exposed to risks related to other markets 
the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were common stocks of the coca cola company and the gillette company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks to which these investees are subject  such as commodity price fluctuations  are required  where material  to be reported upon in their filings with the sec  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 

table of contents interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  down from million one year earlier 
the decrease resulted principally from sales  as well as maturities and redemptions  of such securities during the year 
proceeds received were mainly invested in investments maturing within three months cash equivalents  as a result  cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet increased from million to billion during consequently  market value risks with respect to interest rate movements or otherwise as of december  are substantially lower than at the end of and are considered insignificant 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
fair values of wesco s investments may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
as noted in the preceding section on equity price risk  wesco prefers to acquire entire businesses or invest in equity securities 
when unable to do so  it may invest in mortgage backed securities  government bonds or other interest rate sensitive investments 
wesco s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived interest rate and credit risks 
although wesco s emphasis is conservative  it recognizes and accepts that losses may occur 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations neither wesco nor any of its subsidiaries has off balance sheet arrangements 
nor do they have any insurance obligations for which estimated provisions have not been made  or other significant contractual obligations not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or notes thereto 
wesco and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities  which will result in cash payments in future periods 
certain of those obligations  such as notes payable  are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  wesco and its subsidiaries have entered into long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
a summary of contractual obligations follows 
amounts are in thousands 
payments due total subsequently notes payable  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations  other than for capital expenditures other  principally deferred compensation totals
