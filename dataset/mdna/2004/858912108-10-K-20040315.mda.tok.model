item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
introduction we are the largest provider of regulated medical waste services in north america 
in addition we offer osha compliance services for health care providers and will be introducing several new services during  including software for hospitals to monitor accreditation readiness 

table of contents we derive our medical waste revenues from services to two principal types of customers i outpatient clinics  medical and dental offices  biomedical companies  municipal entities  long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste small account customers and ii hospitals  blood banks  pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste large account customers 
substantially all of our medical waste services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call services  or both 
contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us to the contrary prior to the expiration of the current term of the contract 
contracts with hospitals and other large account customers  which may run for more than one year  typically include price escalator provisions  which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage 
as of december   we served approximately  customers  of which approximately  were small account customers and approximately  were large account customers 
critical accounting policies and procedures our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to our consolidated financial statements  the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for our medical waste services at the time of medical waste collection 
revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary etd treatment equipment are accounted for by the percentage of completion method  whereby income is recognized based on the estimated stage of completion of the individual contract using the cost to cost method 
we routinely review total estimated costs to complete each contract and revise the estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not currently amortized 
we have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and  accordingly  are not amortized 
this position is in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 which became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our goodwill and permits are currently tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we have determined that our customer lists have year lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows see note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts 
accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency 
no single customer accounts for more than of our revenues 

table of contents insurance 
our insurance for worker s compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage  and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices 
a third party administrator is used to process all such claims 
we require all worker s compensation claims to be reported within hours 
as a result  we accrue our worker s compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period 
our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate 
our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience 
we review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each quarter

revenues generated from the sale of etd equipment and licensing of technology internationally were million during  compared to million during during  acquisitions less than one year old contributed approximately million to the increase in our revenues from for the year  internal growth for small account customers increased approximately while revenues from large account customers decreased by approximately because of our winnowing of lower margin accounts 
during  the size of the regulated medical waste market in the united states remained relatively stable 
through our acquisition in january of scherer healthcare  inc and its biosystems sharps management program  we were able to expand our service offerings 
the scherer healthcare acquisition contributed million of the approximately million in acquisition revenue during cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased million or  to million during  from million during the increase was primarily related to the increase in revenues during compared to our gross margin percentage increased to during from during as we realized improvements from our continuous programs to improve margins on our large quantity business  increased our number of small quantity customers electing our steri safe sm program from  to  and improved our transportation productivity by increasing route density 
these improvements to our gross margins were partially offset by an increase in employee benefit costs  which increased by percentage points as a 
table of contents percentage of compensation costs as the cost of healthcare claims increased 
this increase resulted in the evaluation of our employee healthcare programs and changes to our third party administrators and providers  in an effort to manage future cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during  from million during this increase was primarily the result of increased spending as a result of the scherer healthcare acquisition  marketing our steri safe sm program and starting the national rollout of the biosystems sharps management program 
in addition  as noted in the cost of revenues discussion above  employee benefit costs as a percentage of compensation costs increased by percentage points 
amortization decreased to million during  from million during acquisition related costs increased to million in from million in bad debt expense decreased during to million from million in this decrease was the result of improved collections and decreased write offs during selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to during compared to in income from operations 
income from operations increased to million during from million during the increase was due to higher revenues  offset by higher costs of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december  we had a non cash write down of idled incinerator equipment and related spare parts in the amount of million 
income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to during from during as a result of the factors described above 
interest expense and interest income 
interest expense decreased to million during  from million during  primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates during the year 
interest income increased to million during compared to million in as a result of higher interest income on notes receivable 
debt extinguishments and refinancing expenses 
during we repurchased million of senior subordinated notes compared to a repurchase of million in as a result in  we incurred million in redemption premium expenses and million in non cash accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes compared to million and million  respectively  in in addition  we amended our bank credit facility agreement in and paid million in financing fees 
income tax expense

our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million during from million during this decrease was primarily a result of decreased amortization expense as a result of adopting fas  which was partially offset by higher bad debt and legal expenses  increased marketing expenses related to the steri safe sm program and higher insurance costs 
amortization decreased to million during from million during as a result of the adoption of fas bad debt expense increased during to million from million in because of an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts after an evaluation of the collectibility of our outstanding accounts receivable

income tax expense 
income tax expense for and reflects an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively  for federal and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources in january  we amended our senior secured credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity by million by reclassifying borrowings under our revolving credit facility to term a loans 
as amended  the credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility  a million term a loan facility and a million term b loan facility 
our borrowings bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined  at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period  by reference to i a base rate the higher of the reference rate at bank of america  na or above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions or ii the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus  in either case  the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in the credit agreement 
the applicable margin is based upon our leverage ratio 
at december  the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the term a component is on base rate loans and on libor loans  and the margin for interest rates on borrowings under the term b component is on base rate loans and on libor rate loans 
under the credit agreement as amended in january  we extended the maturity of the revolving credit component and the term a loan component to september and extended the maturity of the term b component to september both term loans are repayable in quarterly installments on the last business day of march  june  september and december beginning in the required principal repayments under the term a loan component are million on each quarterly payment date through june  with a final payment of the outstanding principal balance upon maturity in september the required principal payments under the term b loan component are million on each quarterly payment date through june  with a final payment of the outstanding balance upon maturity in september our amended and restated credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our subsidiaries except for the assets of ci and by a pledge of all of the stock of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  all of our stock in ci  all of our stock in our mexican subsidiary and of our stock in our canadian subsidiary 
the amended and restated credit facility also requires us to comply with various 
table of contents financial  reporting and other covenants and restrictions  including a restriction on dividend payments 
at december   our material financial debt covenants were as follows the permitted minimum leverage ratio is 
as of december   our actual leverage ratio was 
the permitted minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is 
as of december   our actual fixed charge coverage ratio was 
the minimum amount of net worth allowed at december   as defined by the credit agreement  is million 
as of december   our actual net worth was million 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility  consisting of million under our revolving credit facility  million under our term a loan facility and under the term b loan facility 
prior to june   the series a convertible preferred stock bore preferential dividends  payable in additional shares of series a convertible preferred stock  at the rate of per annum from the date of issuance 
dividends accrued daily and accumulated annually on the anniversary of the initial issuance 
in july  we entered into a waiver and amendment agreement with the holders of series a convertible preferred stock pursuant to which they agreed that  among other things  the payment in kind dividends ceased to accrue after may  working capital 
at december   our working capital was million compared to working capital of million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to higher accrued insurance and employee compensation liabilities and lower accounts receivable 
we have a high deductible insurance program and our accrued liability increases as we add an additional year of exposure to the balance 
as noted  we have available a million revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility and at december  had borrowed million under this line 
net cash provided or used 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million for this increase primarily reflects higher revenues and income  higher accrued liability and deferred income tax balances and better collections of accounts receivable in compared to  partially offset by increased other asset balances 
net cash provided by operating activities in included a million tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired upon the exercise of incentive stock options 
net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in payments for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million for  primarily for investments in capital equipment to support a nationwide rollout of the biosystems sharps management program and other improvements in our infrastructure  compared to million for in as of december  we had approximately of our treatment capacity in incineration and approximately in non incineration technologies such as our proprietary etd technology and autoclaving 
the implementation of our commitment to move away from incineration may result in a write down of the incineration equipment as and when we close incinerators that we are currently operating 
our commitment to move away from incineration is in the nature of a goal to be accomplished over an undetermined number of years 
because of uncertainties relating  among other things  to customer education and acceptance and legal requirements to incinerate portions of the medical waste  we do not have a timetable for this transition or specific plans to close any of our existing incinerators 
cash investments in acquisitions and international joint ventures for were million compared to million in our largest acquisition in was scherer healthcare  inc for million in net cash 
net cash used in financing activities was million during compared to million for in during we made repayments of million in debt and capital leases which consisted of million in 
table of contents scheduled repayments and million in prepayments 
included in prepayments was million in repurchases of our senior subordinated notes 
in addition  at december  we had million outstanding related to promissory notes issued in connection with acquisitions during and  consisting primarily of a year note issued as part of the micro med industries  inc acquisition  which had an outstanding balance of million at december  senior subordinated notes 
at december   we had million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes outstanding 
these notes bear a fixed rate of interest at per annum  payable semiannually  and will mature on november  under the trust indenture governing the notes  we have the right  beginning on november   to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding notes at a redemption price equal to varying percentages of the aggregate principal amount of note redeemed  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
for redemptions during the year beginning november   the redemption percentage is 
contractual cash commitments 
the following table displays our future contractual cash commitments 
total less than year years years after years payments due by period in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations purchasing obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have not issued any guarantees to other parties that are not recorded on our balance sheet 
at december  we had million in stand by letters of credit issued 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next months and the foreseeable future 
risk factors we are subject to extensive governmental regulation with which it is frequently difficult  expensive and time consuming to comply 
the medical waste management industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the collection  transportation  packaging  labeling  handling  documentation  reporting  treatment and disposal of regulated medical waste 
our business requires us to obtain many permits  authorizations  approvals  certificates or other types of governmental permission from every jurisdiction where we operate 
we believe that we currently comply in all material respects with all applicable permitting requirements 
state and local regulations change often  however  and new regulations are frequently adopted 
changes in the applicable regulations could require us to obtain new permits or to change the way in which we operate 
we might be unable to obtain the new permits that we require  and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant 
the permits that we require  especially those to build and operate treatment plants and transfer facilities  are difficult and time consuming to obtain 
they may also contain conditions or restrictions that limit our ability to operate efficiently  and they may not be issued as quickly as we need or at all 
if we cannot obtain the permits that we need when we need them  or if they contain unfavorable conditions  it could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues 

table of contents the handling and treatment of hazardous medical waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others 
our business requires us to handle materials that may be infectious  poisonous  corrosive or dangerous to life and property in other ways 
while we strive to handle such materials with care and in accordance with accepted and safe methods  the possibility of accidents  leaks  spills  and acts of god always exists 
examples of how people and property may be exposed to such materials include truck accidents  damaged or leaking containers  improper storage of medical waste by customers  vandalism  arson or sabotage  placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process  such as nuclear waste and certain body parts and tissues  or malfunctioning treatment plant equipment 
human beings  animals or property might be injured  sickened or damaged by exposure to medical waste 
this in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries  and substantial damages could be awarded against us 
while we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies  particular instances  claims  damages or events may occur that are not insured against or are inadequately insured against 
an uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity 
the handling of medical waste exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities  which may not be covered by insurance 
as a company engaged in medical waste management  we face risks of liability for environmental contamination 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or cercla  and similar state laws impose strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on the businesses that generate those substances and the businesses that transport them to the facilities 
responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and clean up costs even if they operated their businesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
liability under cercla may be joint and several  which means that if we were found to be a business with responsibility for a particular cercla site  we could be required to pay the entire cost of the investigation and clean up even though we were not the party responsible for the release of the hazardous substance and even though other companies might also be liable 
our pollution liability insurance excludes liabilities under cercla 
thus  if we were to incur liability under cercla and if we could not identify other parties responsible under the law whom we can compel to contribute to our expenses  the cost to us could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity 
our customer service agreements make it clear that the customer is responsible for making sure that only appropriate materials are disposed of 
if there were a claim that a customer might be legally liable for  we may not be successful in recovering our damages 
the level of governmental enforcement of environmental regulations has an uncertain effect on our business and could reduce the demand for our services 
we believe that the government s strict enforcement of laws and regulations relating to medical waste collection and treatment has been good for our business 
these laws and regulations increased the demand for our services 
a relaxation of standards or other changes in governmental regulation of medical waste  such as encouraging the use of landfills without prior treatment of medical waste  
table of contents removing obstacles to the use of incineration and autoclaving  thus allowing the continued use of existing on site incinerators by medical waste generators without having to incur additional compliance costs  or reducing manpower and money used to enforce environmental regulations favorable to our operations  could increase the number of competitors or reduce the need for our services 
we may be required to pay fines and penalties for violations of environmental regulations or our permits 
from time to time we are subject to governmental proceedings to enforce regulations relating to the handling and treatment of medical waste 
we have had to pay fines and penalties and to undertake remedial work at our facilities 
we may be subject to similar proceedings in the future 
government enforcement actions also may be initiated against us based on claims that we are violating our permits 
such proceedings could distract management attention from our business operations and any resulting fines or shutdowns could reduce our profitability 
if we are unable to acquire other medical waste businesses  our revenue and profit growth may be slowed 
historically our growth strategy has been based in part on our ability to acquire other medical waste businesses 
we do not know whether in the future we will be able to identify suitable businesses to buy  complete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us  improve the operations of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate their operations into our own  or avoid or overcome any concerns expressed by regulators 
we compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other medical waste companies 
this competition may result in fewer opportunities to purchase companies that are for sale 
it may also result in higher purchase prices for the businesses that we want to purchase 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will have enough money  be able to borrow enough money on reasonable terms  be able to issue stock or debt instruments like promissory notes as consideration for the purchase  or be able to raise enough money by issuing stock or through other financing methods  to complete the purchases of the businesses that we want to acquire 
we also do not know whether our growth strategy will continue to be effective 
our business is significantly larger than before  and new acquisitions may not have the desired benefits that we have expected in the past 
the implementation of our acquisition strategy could be affected in certain instances by the concerns of state regulators  which could result in our not being able to realize the full synergies or profitability of particular acquisitions 
we may become subject to inquiries and investigations by state antitrust regulators from time to time in the course of completing acquisitions of other medical waste businesses 
in order to obtain regulatory clearance for a particular acquisition  we could be required to modify certain operating practices of the acquired business or to divest ourselves of one or more assets of the acquired business 
changes in the terms of our acquisitions required 
table of contents by regulators or agreed to by us in order to settle regulatory investigations could impede our acquisition strategy or reduce the anticipated synergies or profitability of our acquisitions 
the likelihood and outcome of inquiries and investigations from state regulators in the course of completing acquisitions cannot be predicted 
aggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could drive down our profits and slow our growth 
the medical waste industry is very competitive 
this has required us in the past to reduce our prices  especially to large account customers  and competition may require us to reduce our prices in the future 
substantial price reductions could significantly reduce our earnings 
we face important competition from a large number of small  local competitors 
because it requires very little money or technical know how to compete with us in the collection and transport of medical waste  there are many regional and local companies in the industry 
we face competition from these businesses and that competition may exist in each location to which we try to expand in the future 
our competitors could take actions that would hurt our growth strategy  including the support of regulations that could delay or prevent us from obtaining or keeping permits 
they might also give financial support to citizens groups that oppose our plans to locate a treatment or transfer facility at a particular location 
other sources of competition include large waste generators  such as some hospitals  who maintain their own treatment facilities 
these and other yet unidentified competitors could prevent us from obtaining new customers and could take existing customers away from us 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our substantial indebtedness  which reduces the cash available to finance our internal growth and our acquisition of other medical waste businesses 
we have a large amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total long term indebtedness was million  net of current maturities 
we had borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  and we had the ability to utilize a further million under the facility 
we have scheduled debt service payments under our senior credit facility during  and of zero  million and million  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  as well as to fund our operations and future growth depends upon our ability to generate cash 
our success in doing so depends upon the results of our operations and upon general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
our indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions  make it more difficult to pursue the acquisition of other medical waste management businesses  and require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness  which would prevent us from using it for other purposes 
restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  make acquisitions and make other investments 
our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not do so  our creditors could declare a default under our debt instruments  and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
our debt instruments also contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures  and impose various other restrictions 
these covenants could 
table of contents affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
the loss of our senior executives could affect our ability to manage our business profitably 
we depend on a small number of senior executives 
our future success will depend  among other things  upon our ability to keep these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels 
we compete with other potential employers for employees  and we may not be successful in hiring and keeping the executives and other employees that we need 
we do not have written employment agreements with our president and chief executive officer or other executive officers  and officers and other key employees could leave us with little or no prior notice  either individually or as part of a group 
our loss or inability to hire key employees could impair our ability to manage our business and direct its growth 
our expansion into foreign countries exposes us to unfamiliar regulations and may expose us to new obstacles to growth 
we plan to grow both in the united states and in foreign countries 
we have established operations in canada  mexico and argentina  and south africa and have entered into etd equipment sales and licensing agreements in australia  brazil and japan 
foreign operations carry special risks 
although our business in foreign countries has not yet been affected  our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by government controls  import and export license requirements  political or economic insecurity  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  exchange rate fluctuations  our unfamiliarity with laws  regulations  and customs  restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the united states  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
foreign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the united states 
if we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals  or if we cannot get them when we expect  our growth and profitability from international operations could be limited 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates and increases in duty rates for etd equipment could have similar effects 
the competitive advantages of our etd treatment process and other aspects of our business depend on patents and proprietary rights 
we hold united states patents relating to the etd treatment process and other aspects of processing medical waste 
we have filed or have been assigned patent applications in several foreign countries and we have received patents in australia  canada  france  hong kong  mexico  russia  south africa  south korea and the united kingdom 
pending or future patent applications may not be granted  issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages  and our patents may be challenged by other parties 
in addition  other companies may develop similar processes or avoid our patents 
litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to enforce the patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
any litigation 
table of contents or administrative proceeding could result in substantial cost to us and distraction of our management 
a ruling against us in any litigation or administrative proceeding could expose us to new competition and depress our earnings 
our commercial success also depends on our not infringing patents issued to other parties 
patents belonging to other parties may require us to alter our processes  pay licensing fees or cease using any current or future processes  and as a result  we may be unable to license the technology rights that we may require at a reasonable cost or at all 
if we cannot obtain a license to any infringing technology that we currently use  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we own registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks 
there can be no assurance that our registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks will not infringe upon the rights of other parties 
the requirement to change any of our trademarks  service marks or trade names could result in the loss of any goodwill associated with that trademark  service mark or trade name and could entail significant expense 
our earnings could decline if we write off intangible assets  such as goodwill 
as a result of purchase accounting for our various acquisitions  our balance sheet at december  contains goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of million and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million including indefinite lived intangibles of million 
in accordance with fas  we evaluate on an ongoing basis  using the fair value of reporting units  whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of indefinite lived intangible assets such as goodwill 
as circumstances after an acquisition can change  the value of these intangible assets may not be realized by us 
if we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to incur noncash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill and other unamortized intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior secured credit facility 
our interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rate  which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately million 
fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on our senior subordinated notes  which is fixed 
in we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the subsequent two years  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
these swaps expired during the first quarter of at december  none of our floating rate debt was covered by an interest rate swap agreement 
we have exposure to commodity pricing for gas and diesel fuel for our trucks 
we do not hedge these items to manage the exposure
