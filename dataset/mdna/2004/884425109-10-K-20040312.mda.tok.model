item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in two segments 
the pump and compressor segment designs  manufactures  markets  sells and services pump and compressor products through worldwide operations 
in august  we significantly increased the size of our pump and compressor business by acquiring substantially all the assets and liabilities of werner rietschle holding gmbh rietschle  a privately held company based in schopfheim  germany 
rietschle s operating results are included in the company s operating results since the august  acquisition date 
as we continue to integrate the rietschle and thomas entities  it becomes more difficult to determine the impact of the rietschle acquisition  on a stand alone basis 
the company has made its best estimate of the rietschle impact to various income statement line items  such as net sales  gross profit  operating income and net income 
beginning in  it will not be meaningful to make these estimates 
the pump and compressor segment supplies products to the original equipment manufacturer oem market in such applications as medical equipment  gasoline vapor and refrigerant recovery  automotive and transportation  printing  packaging and many others 
an important market to the company is the medical equipment market  which includes oxygen concentrators  nebulizers  aspirators  and other devices 
as previously announced  we expect our sales to the oxygen concentrator oem market to be reduced in by million to million as a result of the loss of one of our customer s oxygen concentrator product lines to a competitor beginning in the second quarter of even with the loss of these sales  the company has a leading market share in the oxygen concentrator oem market worldwide 
in order to reduce our cost structure and remain price competitive  we are in the process of constructing a manufacturing facility in china  which should be in production by the first half of we continue to rationalize our existing production facilities around the world to achieve the most cost effective and high quality production capabilities 
during  we closed our manufacturing facility in fleurier  switzerland  and relocated this production to other existing facilities 
we only incurred moving related costs for this shutdown  since this was a former rietschle facility and all other shutdown costs were recorded as goodwill as part of the opening balance sheet adjustments 
in  we also built and opened a new facility in memmingen  germany and relocated from the older leased facility late in  incurring approximately  in relocation costs 
this new building will allow the company to produce in a more efficient manner and consolidate production 
in february  the company announced the closing of its wuppertal  germany manufacturing facility which will generate approximately million of one time costs over the first three quarters of production from the wuppertal facility will be transferred to the new memmingen facility 
we believe these steps were necessary to position the company for future growth opportunities and the current competitive environment 
the company also operates in the lighting segment through its interest in the genlyte thomas group llc gtg joint venture 
the company s investment in gtg is accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
gtg designs  manufacturers  markets  and sells lighting fixtures for a wide variety of applications in the commercial  industrial and residential markets for both indoor and outdoor fixtures 
terms of the llc agreement are discussed in various sections of part  item in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates thomas discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon thomas consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when preparing these consolidated financial statements  the company is required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to product warranties  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies  and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company identified the following critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
included with the accounting policies are potential adverse results which could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of thomas customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
thomas provides for the estimated cost of product warranties 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  should actual product failure rates differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
thomas writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
for its business combination in  the company utilized an independent appraiser in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
if actual market conditions or other factors are different than those used by the independent appraiser  then additional asset write downs may be required 
thomas holds a percent interest in the genlyte thomas group llc gtg joint venture  which comprises thomas lighting segment and is accounted for using the equity method 
if future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of gtg occurred  it could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the company s investment  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
gtg s critical accounting policies are determined separately by the genlyte group incorporated  which owns percent of gtg and consolidates the gtg results 
results of operations on august   the company purchased substantially all the assets and liabilities of werner rietschle holding gmbh rietschle  a privately held company based in schopfheim  germany

million favorable impact due to the accounting change for goodwill amortization 
the pump and compressor segment s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in these exclude corporate expenses which are discussed in a separate section below 
the higher percent of sales in for sg a expenses is primarily due to having a full year of rietschle sales and service offices throughout the world  which require a higher level of sg a costs to operate  as well as increased personnel costs 
the sg a expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or in the increase in was primarily related to the rietschle acquisition

million favorable impact from not recording goodwill amortization in operating income for the european operations was lower in due to unfavorable sales mix  a 
million write down of a long lived asset  and 
million write off of certain accounts receivable and inventory related to one customer

the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt     capital lease obligations     operating leases      notes payable to banks   purchase obligations   other long term obligations total contractual obligations     purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company 
these primarily relate to normal ongoing inventory purchase obligations but also include other items such as capital commitments and service agreements 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated as of december  there also may be circumstances where goods and services are purchased as needed  with no enforceable and legally binding commitment 
for this reason  these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows 
as of december   the company had standby letters of credit totaling  with expiration dates during the company anticipates that these letters of credit will be renewed at their expiration dates 
the company announced in december that it planned to repurchase  from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors  up to percent  or  shares  of its outstanding common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at the prevailing market prices 
during  no purchases were made 
through december   the company has purchased  on a cumulative basis   shares at a cost of million  or an average cost of per share 
the company plans to fund any purchase of company stock through a combination of cash flows generated from operating activities and our revolving line of credit 
the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates  with the exception of the million senior notes that accrue interest at a fixed rate 
short term borrowings of million at december   are priced at variable interest rates 
the company s results of operations and cash flows  therefore  would be affected by interest rate changes to the variable rate debt 
at december   million was outstanding 
a basis point movement in the interest rate on the variable rate debt of million would result in an  annualized effect on interest expense and cash flows  net of tax 
the company also has short term investments  including cash equivalents  of million as of december  that bear interest at variable rates 
a basis point movement in the interest rate would result in an approximate  annualized effect on interest income and cash flows  net of tax 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on current interest rates offered to the company for similar instruments 
a basis point movement in the interest rate would result in an approximate  annualized effect on the fair value of long term debt  net of tax 
the company has significant operations consisting of sales and manufacturing activities in foreign countries 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in currency exchange rates or changing economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company manufactures or distributes its products 
currency exposures for our pump and compressor segment are concentrated in germany but exist to a lesser extent in other parts of europe  asia and south america 
our lighting segment currency exposure is primarily in canada 
there is a risk associated with changing foreign exchange rates 
the company s objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of anticipated foreign currency revenues and expenses 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the underlying transactions as they occur 
the euro is the only currency hedged 
at december   the company held forward contracts expiring through december to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  intercompany inventory purchases 
these hedging contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and accordingly  are adjusted to current market values through other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are recognized 
upon recognition  such gains and losses are recorded in operations as an adjustment to the carrying amounts of the underlying transactions in the period in which these transactions are recognized 
at december   the foreign currency forward contracts had a notional amount of euro  and a fair value of approximately  the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts  which represents an asset  is included in other current assets 
the amount of net gain deferred through other comprehensive income as of december  was approximately  there was no gain or loss recognized through other income expense during fiscal a basis point movement in foreign currency rates on the company s open foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
working capital increased from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate impacts 
working capital increased from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to the rietschle acquisition on august  december dollars in thousands working capital current ratio long term debt  less current portion    long term debt to total capital certain loan agreements of the company include restrictions on working capital  operating leases  tangible net worth  and the payment of cash dividends and stock distributions 
under the most restrictive of these arrangements  retained earnings of million are not restricted at december  thomas is currently in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in its borrowing agreements 
in the event of non compliance or if thomas prepays the debt  then thomas would incur a penalty 
at december   the prepayment penalty would have been approximately 
million on a pre tax basis 
as of december   the company had a million revolving line of credit with its banks through august   million of which was outstanding 
this line of credit was used to fund for the cash payment of million for the rietschle acquisition and to support the short term needs of the business for working capital changes  fixed asset additions  and general business use 
as of december   the company had uncommitted short term borrowing arrangements being used by some of its foreign offices which totaled million 
as of december  and  except as described above related to the gtg joint venture  management was aware of no relationships with any other unconsolidated entities  financial partnerships  structured finance entities  or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
