item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical information and assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and circumstances that may impact us in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
generally  our collaborative agreements include a research and development phase that spans a specified time period 
however  in certain cases the collaborative agreement specifies a research and development phase which culminates with the completion of a development work plan but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which the work plan will be performed and therefore  the period over which revenue should be recognized 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development 
table of contents milestone considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and stage of development 
if our estimate of the research and development time period increases the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front license and technology access fees for a given period would decrease 
asset impairment on january   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  we performed a transitional impairment test on our recorded intangible assets that consisted primarily of acquisition related goodwill and lease intangibles 
we also performed a subsequent interim impairment test on march   due to the presence of impairment indicators as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this impairment test involved a two step approach 
step one required estimating the fair value of the company and comparing it to the carrying value of recorded and unrecorded assets 
since the carrying value of the recorded and unrecorded assets exceeded the estimated fair value  we performed the second step that required allocating the fair value to all of our assets and liabilities  including unrecorded intangibles  to determine the deemed fair value  if any  of goodwill 
both steps required us to make significant assumptions and estimates  including determining our fair value and the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
in addition  this process required us to estimate future cash flows from our research and development projects in process and the applicable discount rates 
we engaged an independent third party valuation specialist to assist us in our impairment analysis 
the analysis resulted in a million goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of  which represented the write off of all goodwill existing as of the date of the test 
in the event that future acquisitions result in goodwill  we will be required to perform this test on at least an annual basis 
in the second and third quarters of we subleased approximately  square feet of our leased facilities in south san francisco 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 long lived assets must be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long lived assets might not be recoverable 
upon entering into the sublease agreements an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the subleases was performed and was determined to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset acquired lease  related leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
because the carrying value exceeded the fair value  we recognized an impairment charge of million and a million in the second and third quarters of  respectively  related to these assets 
commitments and contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not accrued for any legal contingencies  as the probable outcomes of the cases are not known 
overview we are a developer of innovative immunotherapeutic products designed to affect the immune system and treat debilitating and life threatening conditions caused by cancer and infectious disease 
originally founded to pursue development of leading  proprietary antigen discovery technology  we are emerging as a product development company with multiple product candidates  many in late stage human clinical trials 
we are driven by an aggressive commercialization strategy that we believe will give us an opportunity for sustained and consistent commercial success 
our development efforts are focused on core areas of immunotherapy expertise  including monoclonal antibodies  vaccines and adjuvants  and small molecules called tlr agonists and antagonists that stimulate innate immunity 
in june  we received approval from the fda of bexxar therapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with cd positive  follicular  non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  with and without transformation  whose disease is refractory to rituximab and has relapsed following chemotherapy 
we and gsk are co 
table of contents promoting bexxar therapeutic regimen in the united states  with each company contributing to the commercialization efforts and both companies sharing profits and losses equally 
we generate revenue from technology licenses  collaborative research and development arrangements  cost reimbursement contracts  co promotion revenues under our agreement with gsk for bexxar therapeutic regimen and research adjuvants 
revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of non refundable and or guaranteed technology license fees  collaborative research funding  technology access fees  and various milestone and future product royalty or profit sharing payments 
revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the respective agreements  generally the research and development period 
revenue from substantive at risk milestones is recognized upon completion of the milestones and future product royalties are recognized when earned  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
co promotion revenue or expense under our agreement with gsk for bexxar therapeutic regimen is determined based on the calculation of joint profit or loss as defined in the agreement 
revenue from adjuvant sales is recognized upon customer acceptance of the product 
payments received in advance of recognition as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements  and approximately of our revenue resulted from funds awarded through government grants 
as of december   we had total stockholders equity of million 
we have entered into  and intend to continue to enter into  collaborative agreements at various stages in the research and development process 
we believe that this active corporate partnering strategy provides four distinct advantages it focuses on our fundamental strength in immunotherapeutic product discovery and selected product development  it capitalizes on our corporate partners strengths in product development  manufacturing and commercialization  it may enable us to retain significant downstream participation in product sales  and it reduces our financing requirements 
our material collaborative agreements that continue to provide us with funding include the following gsk 
effective september  we entered into a comprehensive corporate partnership with gsk 
under the agreement we granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and sell vaccine products and certain dendritic cell therapy products that incorporate antigens discovered or in licensed under this corporate partnership 
we also granted gsk license rights to develop  manufacture and sell passive immunotherapy products  such as t cell or antibody therapeutics  and therapeutic drug monitoring products  in each case that incorporate these antigens 
gsk s rights under the agreement are co exclusive with us in japan with respect to tuberculosis 
the rights that we granted to gsk under the collaboration and license agreement covered our cancer antigen discovery programs in breast  colon  ovarian and prostate cancer  our her neu breast and ovarian cancer vaccine program  our mammaglobin breast cancer vaccine program  and our infectious disease antigen discovery programs in c 
pneumoniae  c 
trachomatis and mycobacterium tuberculosis 
to the extent that clinical and commercial milestones in the programs are achieved  gsk is required to make payments to us 
the individual amounts of such payments vary  depending on the milestones achieved and the types of product sold 
gsk is also required to pay us future royalty payments on all 
table of contents products sales  which royalties vary depending on the types of products sold 
on august  the funded research and development period of our collaboration and license agreement with gsk terminated in all of the cancer fields covered by the agreement 
gsk extended the funded research and development period for an additional years through august for the research and development programs for tuberculosis and chlamydia vaccines 
under the terms of the extension  gsk is required to fund one half of the actual cost of the tuberculosis program and the cost of the chlamydia program for a year period 
in january  we and gsk entered into new agreements to further advance the development of multiple solid tumor vaccines 
following expiration of the funded research period for the cancer fields under the original agreement  one of the new agreements extends our and gsk s collaborative efforts into vaccine development and potential proof of principle clinical trials 
under the terms of this new agreement  gsk granted us a worldwide  exclusive license to develop a vaccine candidate for prostate cancer and a vaccine candidate for breast cancer 
as a part of this agreement  gsk retains the option to buy back exclusive worldwide rights for either or both vaccine candidates following the completion of proof of principle clinical trials 
if gsk exercises its buy back rights  we have the option of participating in further development  up to and including a sharing of promotion rights in the united states 
the buy back price will be based on our research costs incurred under this new agreement  plus a premium of and up to an additional million depending on the stage of development at the time gsk exercises its buy back option 
in the event gsk does not exercise its buy back option  we will be free to develop the vaccines alone or with other partners and have agreed to pay gsk success based milestones and royalties in the event of product sales 
under our new agreement  we will be responsible for providing resources and development funding of up to million to complete proof of principle clinical studies over a period of time in excess of five years 
this funding will be used to pay for gmp grade material  production and clinical trials for prostate and breast cancer vaccine development efforts 
under the original agreement  gsk will continue development of an alternative version of the prostate cancer vaccine at its own expense and has agreed to pay us milestones and royalties on potential product sales 
under the original agreement  gsk is also continuing the development of our her neu vaccine 
a proprietary formulation of this vaccine has been manufactured by gsk and an ind application has been approved for the product s clinical testing in the united states 
gsk has also agreed to pay us milestones and royalties on potential product sales of our her neu vaccine 
in a related new agreement  we acquired vaccine and antibody development rights from gsk to all ovarian cancer antigens whose discovery resulted from the original agreement 
in this related agreement we also acquired from gsk all cancer diagnostic rights and t cell adoptive cancer immunotherapy rights for all cancer antigens discovered by us in the breast  prostate  colon and ovarian cancer fields as well as for the her neu and mammaglobin antigens 
gsk has the right to terminate any of these agreements in the event of our material default of such agreement  or our bankruptcy or insolvency 
if we materially breach our original agreement with gsk  gsk may as an alternative to terminating the agreement  continue its licenses with a reduction in the amounts owed to us as potential milestones and royalties 
under our original agreement  gsk also has the right for any reason with months prior notice to terminate its licenses in the breast  prostate and colon fields and for the her neu and mammaglobin antigens  although this termination right does not apply to the breast cancer vaccine candidate and prostate cancer vaccine candidate that gsk has licensed to us under one of the new agreements 
also under the original agreement  gsk has the right for any reason with months prior notice to terminate its licenses in the tuberculosis and chlamydia fields after august in addition  under our original agreement  if an acquisition of us results in a material breach of that agreement  gsk would have the right to terminate that agreement and we and any of our employees that remain employees of us or our acquiror would be precluded from working in any of the disease fields covered by our original agreement with gsk for years after such termination 

table of contents if we materially breach our new agreement for the development of a breast cancer vaccine candidate and prostate cancer vaccine candidate because of our failure to perform the development program  the rights to those vaccine candidates will revert to gsk and we will also be deemed to be in material breach of our new agreement under which we acquired from gsk the ovarian cancer rights and diagnostic and t cell product rights related to our cancer antigens that were included in our original agreement 
if gsk terminates our new agreement that covers ovarian cancer  diagnostics and t cell products  because of our material breach  all of the rights under that agreement will revert to gsk with the exception of any rights we may have granted to any third parties before the termination  and we will be required to pay gsk twice the amount of revenues we receive from those third parties as would have paid had the agreement not been terminated for our material breach 
we have a collaboration agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen  which was approved in june  by the fda for the treatment of patients with cd positive  follicular  nhl  with and without transformation  whose disease is refractory to rituximab and has relapsed following chemotherapy 
under the agreement  as amended in april  gsk s territory was reduced to the united states and  upon regulatory approval of bexxar therapeutic regimen  gsk paid us a milestone payment 
under the terms of the agreement  both companies contribute to the commercialization efforts of bexxar therapeutic regimen in the united states and share profits and losses from gsk s sales of bexxar therapeutic regimen equally 
we recognize the costs we incur associated with bexxar therapeutic regimen related activities such as the cost of co promotion revenue and sales and promotion costs in our statement of operations 
we and gsk then prepare a quarterly calculation of the joint profit or loss which considers all revenue and costs associated with bexxar therapeutic regimen commercial activities incurred by us and gsk and the equal sharing of the joint profit or loss 
if the quarterly joint profit or loss calculation results in a reimbursement to corixa  we record that amount as revenue 
if the quarterly joint profit or loss calculation results in a payment by corixa  we record that amount as additional operating expense 
prior to commercialization  we recorded our share of the net reimbursement or payment from the joint profit or loss calculation in sales  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december  our actual commercial costs related to bexxar therapeutic regimen and the payment resulting from the joint profit or loss calculation are included in sales  general and administrative expenses 
bexxar sales were million in under the agreement  gsk provided us with a million credit line that was fully drawn by coulter in december terms and conditions of the credit line are discussed further in footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and which we may choose to repay in cash or in shares of our common stock on or prior to the october  maturity date 
under the terms of the agreement  gsk has agreed to reimburse us for certain clinical and manufacturing development costs and pay us for the achievement of certain defined clinical development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in  we recognized revenue of million for the reimbursement of clinical and other development costs from gsk 
we have several license and supply agreements with gsk  granting gsk licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for infectious diseases  cancers and allergies that gsk is developing 
these agreements grant gsk exclusive and co exclusive license rights depending on the disease field and territory 
under the terms of the agreements  gsk pays annual license fees  milestones  transfer payments and future royalty payments 
we have an outstanding loan from gsk in the principal amount of million  which amount was due on september  at gsk s option  gsk may choose to receive repayment of this loan in cash or shares of our common stock at a specified premium to the five day average closing price of our common stock for the period immediately preceding september  gsk has not yet made its election regarding the form of repayment and accordingly the million loan remains outstanding 

table of contents amounts receivable from gsk at december  and were and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements with gsk 
amersham health 
in october  we entered into an agreement whereby amersham health has agreed to market bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe 
we and amersham health will cooperate to register bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe 
we will initially be the holder of the maa for bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe  and after certain conditions have been met  including approval for commercial sale in europe  we will transfer the maa to amersham health 
we will be responsible for generating clinical trial data to support the registration of bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe and amersham health will be responsible for the manufacture and sale of bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe 
under the terms of a stock purchase agreement with amersham health  we had the option to sell up to a total of million of shares of our common stock to amersham health 
upon execution of the agreement amersham health purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million at a price of per share  which represented a forty percent premium of approximately million to the then current market value of our common stock 
the premium has been accounted for as a nonrefundable up front license payment and was deferred and is being recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
following our partial option exercises in october and december  on may   we completed the exercise of our option to sell up to million of shares of our common stock to amersham health when we sold  shares of our common stock to amersham health at a price per share of for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  amersham health has agreed to pay us milestone payments upon regulatory approval in europe as well as milestone payments based on achievement of certain sales volume targets 
amersham health has also agreed to pay us royalties on all future product sales in europe 
amersham health has the right to terminate our agreement for our material breach  insolvency  after october or if commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe is blocked because another product is or if the emea does not validate our maa because the emea determines that the maa is not sufficient 
wyeth 
we have license and supply agreements with wyeth  granting wyeth licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for certain infectious and autoimmune disease fields that wyeth is developing 
these agreements grant wyeth exclusive  co exclusive and non exclusive license rights depending on the disease field 
under the terms of the agreements  wyeth pays annual license fees  milestones  transfer payments and future royalty payments 
we recognized revenue related to our agreements with wyeth of million  million and  in  and  respectively 
zambon group and jt 
during may and june  we entered into corporate partnerships with zambon and jt  respectively  for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing and treating lung cancer 
zambon has exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in europe  the countries of the former soviet union  argentina  brazil and columbia and co exclusive rights in china 
under the june agreement we granted jt exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products outside of the territory licensed to zambon  including the united states and japan  and co exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in china 
we also granted zambon a nonexclusive license and jt an option to formulate vaccines that may result from the collaboration using our microsphere delivery system with our proprietary adjuvants 
during  the year research terms of the agreements expired and the respective research funding obligations ceased 
in november  we and zambon amended our agreement so that we jointly fund clinical testing of a non small cell lung cancer vaccine 
in december  we recorded a milestone payment of million from zambon in connection with the filing of our ind for a lung cancer vaccine candidate in the united states 
in january  we amended and restated our agreement with jt so that we hold exclusive rights to all antigens discovered in our lung cancer vaccine program  in all countries previously licensed to jt  with the exception of rights associated with commercialization of a non small 
table of contents cell  lung carcinoma vaccine candidate in japan 
under the terms of our amended agreement with jt  jt will continue to hold an exclusive license to this vaccine candidate for development and commercialization in japan  and we will hold all rights in north america and in those territories not previously licensed to zambon 
in connection with the restructuring of the jt agreement  we and jt have agreed to pay each other fees  milestones and royalties in the event that development milestones and product sales are achieved 
kirin 
in december  we entered into a multiyear development and commercialization agreement with kirin for potential cancer vaccine for the treatment of multiple forms of cancer  including leukemia  myelodysplasia and melanoma 
under the agreement we granted kirin exclusive rights to develop and market vaccine products resulting from our wt vaccine candidate in asia australasia 
we and kirin have agreed to share wt vaccine commercialization rights and kirin has agreed to fund one half of the research and development costs in north america 
we will retain marketing rights for the potential vaccine in europe 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  kirin paid us million in up front license fees  which is being recognized as revenue over the estimated research and development term 
under the terms of the agreement  kirin has agreed to co fund development of wt vaccine candidate and pay us success based milestone payments and royalties on future product sales in asia australasia 
in connection with this agreement  we recognized revenue of million in kirin has the right to terminate our agreement in the event of our material breach 
if kirin terminates our agreement because of our material breach within months after the effective date of the agreement  kirin may choose to have us pay a termination fee rather than pursue any other rights and remedies 
kirin may also choose not to terminate the agreement for our material breach  no matter when the breach occurs  but instead may keep its licenses intact rather than pursue any other rights and remedies  in which case all of kirin s payment obligations to us will be reduced 
kirin also has the right to terminate our agreement at any time in north america  asia or both territories  and in any of these cases kirin must pay us a termination fee 
both we and kirin have the right to terminate the agreement before commercial launch of the first product if together we determine there are no products worthy of further development or if any product causes a serious adverse event 
however  if kirin chooses to terminate the agreement for development or adverse event reasons  we have the right to continue product development ourselves and depending on further development kirin may be obligated to pay us a termination fee 
if we choose to terminate the agreement for development or adverse event reasons  kirin will have the right to continue product development and pay us royalties in the event of product sales 
kirin also has the right to terminate our agreement in the event product development and commercialization is prevented due to certain third party intellectual property positions 
kirin also has the right to terminate our agreement if no product has successfully completed clinical trials by ten years after the effective date  if no product has achieved regulatory approval in the united states or japan by years after the effective date  our performance is delayed by at least months as a result of force majeure or we terminate or breach a third party license under which kirin is a sublicensee and as a result kirin is sued or kirin s rights under our agreement are materially diminished 
in addition  kirin also has the right to terminate the agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency 
medicis and zenyaku kogyo 
in august  we entered into a multiyear development  commercialization and license agreement covering our psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  pvac treatment  with medicis 
under the agreement we provide medicis exclusive rights to pvac treatment in the united states and canada 
medicis made a nonrefundable payment of million upon effectiveness of the agreement 
in august  we entered into a corporate partnership with zenyaku kogyo for researching and developing pvac treatment 
under the agreement we granted zenyaku kogyo exclusive rights to pvac treatment in japan 
in may the year research term of the agreement expired and zenyaku kogyo s research funding obligation ceased 
under the terms of the agreement  zenyaku kogyo s rights to pvac treatment in japan continue and they are required to make future milestone payments based on successful clinical and commercial progress  and a royalty stream on future product sales 

table of contents in december we announced that we have discontinued development of pvac treatment due to phase ii trial results that confirmed pvac therapy failed to provide a statistically significant benefit versus placebo 
we also terminated our license agreement with medicis 
in connection with the termination of the license agreement  medicis has no additional funding obligations 
as a result of discontinuing development of pvac treatment  we recognized million of revenue and million of expense that was previously deferred and was related to the initial medicis payment received in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion  of which million is attributable to the write off of acquired ipr d costs associated with our acquisitions  million is attributable to goodwill related charges and million is attributable to lease related impairment charges 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of various costs associated with our discovery  research and development programs and the purchase of technology 
as noted above  the funded research phase of certain of our collaborative agreements has expired and we may bear a larger portion of the related research program costs in the future 
additionally  as research programs progress from early stages into clinical development the costs continue to increase 
substantially all of our revenue to date has resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on entering into corporate partnerships for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully manufacturing and marketing our products once they are approved 
even if we are successful in the aforementioned activities our operations may not be profitable 
in addition  payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount 
therefore  our operating results for any period may fluctuate significantly and may not be comparable to the operating results for any other period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue our revenue was million for  million in and million in the increase compared with is primarily due to revenue received from our collaborative agreements with gsk  the majority of which results from milestone revenue received under our agreement for bexxar therapeutic regimen  revenue which had previously been deferred from our collaboration with medicis of million as a result of discontinuing development of pvac in december and increased revenue of million related to our wt cancer vaccine agreement with kirin 
these increases were partially offset by the anticipated expiration of the funded research phases of certain of our collaborative agreements  including decreases of million related to our vaccine development agreement with gsk  million related to our lung cancer vaccine partnership with jt  million related to our lung cancer vaccine partnership with zambon  million related to our therapeutic antibody agreement with purdue pharma 
in addition  reimbursement revenue from our collaborative agreement for bexxar therapeutic regimen with gsk decreased million and revenue from our collaborative agreement with beaufour ipsen related to our proprietary anergix vaccine platform decreased approximately million 
the decrease compared with was primarily due to payments received in  including a milestone payment for the achievement of certain clinical trial related milestones in connection with bexxar therapeutic regimen from our collaborative agreement with gsk  million from our ex vivo agreement with idri and million related to the expiration of the research phase of our vaccine development collaborative agreement with gsk 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue of approximately million from our collaborative agreement with beaufour ipsen related to our proprietary anergix vaccine platform 
revenue in included a milestone payment of million from zambon for the filing of our ind for a lung cancer vaccine in the united states 

table of contents revenue under government grants and contracts was million in  million in and million in we expect revenue to fluctuate in the future depending on our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements  timing and amounts of payments under our existing collaboration agreements and our ability to commercialize our potential products 
expenses research and development expenses our research and development expenses were million for  million in and million in the decrease as compared with is due primarily to reduced early stage research and development expense of million as we focus on programs with the highest chance of near term commercial success  a reduction in deferred compensation expense of million related to options assumed in the coulter acquisition and a reduction in south san francisco facilities expense of million due to buildings that we subleased in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in bexxar therapeutic regiment production cost of million and million resulting from fees paid to genesis research and development corporation  ltd  or genesis  that were previously deferred and amortized over the estimated development period prior to discontinuing development of pvac in december and million resulting from manufacturing development activities associated with our adjuvants and tlr product candidates 
the decrease compared with was due primarily to a reduction in deferred compensation expense of million related to options assumed in the coulter acquisition  a reduction in the purchase of third party manufactured materials of million  payroll and personnel expenses of million related to our workforce reduction in south san francisco  and a decrease in clinical development activity of million  offset by an increase of million in facility expenses due in part to additional leased space in south san francisco 
we intend to offset south san francisco facilities cost through subleases in the future 
we expect research and development expenses to increase or remain stable in the future as we continue to pursue our clinical and preclinical activities 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs to treat cancer and infectious disease 
we estimate the costs associated with research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs approximate the following in millions research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development because of the large number of research projects we have ongoing at any one time  and the ability to utilize resources across several projects  the majority of our research and development costs are not directly tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
we manage our projects by reviewing scientific data and by supplementing this data with our cost allocations 
our cost allocations are based primarily on human resource time incurred on each project 
the costs allocated to a project as a result do not necessarily reflect the actual costs of the project 
accordingly  we do not maintain actual cost incurred information for our projects on a project by project basis 
costs attributed to research and preclinical projects largely represent our pipeline generating activities 
costs associated with clinical development programs represent the advancement of these activities into product candidates 
most of our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to 
table of contents receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and it is uncertain which of our product candidates would be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled important factors that may affect our business  our results of operations and our stock price 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost 
we recorded deferred compensation of million associated with the coulter acquisition in  which represents the intrinsic value of the unearned options of coulter employees existing at the date of acquisition 
deferred compensation is being amortized on a graded vesting method over the remaining vesting period of the options  generally four years 
we amortized  million and million of deferred compensation to research and development expense in  and  respectively 
we expect deferred compensation expense to decrease in and future years due to employee attrition and the declining impact from using the graded vesting approach for calculating deferred compensation expense 
sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses were million for  million in and million in the increase in as compared with is primarily due to the cost associated with the commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen and legal fees related to our patent infringement litigation with biogen idec 
the decrease in as compared with was due primarily to reduced marketing and sales expenses of million related to our workforce reduction in south san francisco and a reduction in deferred compensation expense of million related to options assumed in the coulter merger 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in in facility expenses of  due in part to additional leased space in south san francisco 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of our business activities as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities 
intangible amortization and goodwill impairment our intangible amortization expense was  for and compared to million for effective january   we adopted sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we will continue to amortize separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite useful lives 
as such  we will continue to amortize the remaining acquired lease and adjuvant know how over their useful lives 
on march   we received a second complete review letter from the fda regarding our bla for bexxar therapeutic regimen 
in the complete review letter  the fda stated that additional clinical studies would be required to provide sufficient evidence of the safety and net clinical benefit of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
upon announcement on march  of the receipt of the complete review letter from the fda  the value of our common stock declined 
in management s opinion  this decline in our stock price represented an indication of impairment of recorded goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  an interim test of goodwill impairment was performed as of march  the impairment test involves a two step approach 
under step one of the test we compared our estimated fair value based upon the market price of our common stock to the carrying value of our equity 
because the carrying value of our equity exceeded our fair value  we performed step two of the test which involved allocating our fair value the reporting unit to all of our assets 
table of contents and liabilities to determine how much  if any  of the excess value should be allocated to goodwill 
the results of the impairment test indicated that the entire balance of goodwill was impaired and accordingly we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of interest income our interest income decreased to million for  from million in and from million in the decrease in as compared with is due primarily to lower yields on our investments in we expect interest income to be higher in future periods due to higher cash balances resulting from financing transactions completed in june interest expense our interest expense was million in as compared with million for each of the years ended december  and the increase in as compared with was primarily attributable to higher loan balances primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible notes in june outstanding debt at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
other income our other income was million for compared with million in and million in the decrease in as compared to is due primarily to the sale of specific preclinical assets and other equipment to medarex in the second quarter of which resulted in other income of million 
other income in includes a million gain from additional consideration received from our asset sale to medarex 
other income for included a gain of million on the sale of our investment in abgenix 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees based on the guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements to recognize such fees over the term of the related research and development collaboration arrangement on a straight line basis  as this method best matches the effort provided 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of january   was reported as a charge in the year ended december  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the research and development collaboration agreements 
for the year ended december   the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share less million of the deferred revenue related to the cumulative effect adjustment that was recognized as revenue during the year per share 
revenue includes million for and million for that was previously recognized and included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from collaborative agreements and the issuance of equity and debt instruments 
for the previous three years  we have received cash of approximately million from collaborative research agreements and grants  approximately million from the sale of convertible subordinated notes  approximately million from the sale of million newly issued shares of our common stock and  five year warrants to purchase common stock in a private placement to select institutional and other accredited investors  approximately million from the sale of million newly issued shares of our common stock and million five year warrants to purchase our common stock in a private placement to select institutional and other accredited investors  million from the sale of preclinical assets to medarex  million from bank loans  approximately million from the issuance of

during  and we received total research and development funding of million under our vaccine discovery collaboration with gsk 
as of december   future funding available under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments  which are contingent upon the success of the research 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations and credit lines in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total year years years thereafter long term obligations operating leases bi pharma total contractual commitments included in short term obligations is a million line of credit that has been fully drawn and at our option may be paid in cash or in shares of our common stock on or prior to the october maturity date 
we are responsible for providing resources and development funding of up to million over a period in excess of five years related to a collaborative agreement with gsk 
the funding will consist of our personnel and external costs associated with preclinical and clinical development activities 
we are also required to pay dividends on our preferred stock 
the dividend can be paid in cash or common stock  at our option 
the maximum amount of cash that would be paid in a year would be million and the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued is  in june  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due in to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we will pay interest on the notes on january and july of each year  beginning on january  the notes mature on july  during  we used million of cash in our operations  compared with million in and million in the increase in cash used in operations in as compared to is due primarily to the cost associated with the commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
our investing activities used cash of million in  compared with cash provided of million in and cash provided of million in the increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily due to the purchase of available for sale securities 
our financing activities provided cash of million in as compared to million in and million in the increase in of cash received from financing activities was due primarily to the net proceeds of approximately million from our sale of convertible subordinated notes 
for  and  we invested million  million and million  respectively  in property and equipment 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with committed payments under our existing corporate partnerships  bank credit agreements  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  we intend to seek additional corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  public or private debt financings  and 
table of contents additional capital lease transactions 
however  additional financing may be unavailable on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be forced to limit some or all of our research and development programs and related operations  curtail commercialization of our product candidates and  ultimately  cease operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others continued scientific progress in our discovery  research and product development programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control

 which is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   applies to costs associated with an exit activity  including restructurings  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
requires that exit or disposal costs are recorded as an operating expense when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
we accounted for our november restructuring  as discussed in note  in accordance with sfas no 
subsequent events on march  we announced that we and gsk have reached a settlement with biogen idec regarding all outstanding patent litigation between us and biogen idec 
the settlement  which serves as the basis for the dismissal of all patent litigation between the parties  provides for biogen idec to pay to us and gsk a million upfront settlement payment  as well as a one time milestone payment based on future zevalin sales performance  and royalty payments on zevalin sales from january  until the expiration of all bexxar therapeutic regimen patents that were the subject of the litigation 
we and gsk will also enter into a worldwide  cross license agreement with biogen idec relating to each party s patents in suit 
on march  ndc new markets investments iv  lp  or ndc  of which wells fargo community development corporation is a limited partner  pursuant to a promissory note and credit agreement provided a loan of approximately million to us to support our construction costs at the ninth and stewart lifesciences building in seattle 
the term of the loan is seven years  during which we pay interest only with a balloon principal payment on march  the note bears interest at libor plus 
ndc will forgive a portion of the loan if we are in compliance the terms and conditions of the note and the credit agreement 
pursuant to a security agreement  the loan from ndc is fully secured by cash and cash equivalents 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and  accordingly  are presented at fair value on our balance sheets 
we generally invest our excess cash in a rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had long term obligations outstanding of approximately million 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination thereof 
the market value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

table of contents the table below summarizes the estimated effects on certain assets and liabilities based on hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table estimated fair value hypothetical hypothetical after percentage change in hypothetical decrease in fair value at interest rate change in stockholders december  bp basis points interest rate equity in thousands assets us government agencies and corporate obligations  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  bp increase  liabilities long term obligations  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  bp increase  less than important factors that may affect our businesses  our results of operations and our stock price 
acceptance of bexxar therapeutic regimen in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will limit our potential co promotion revenue from sales of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
bexxar therapeutic regimen requires medical personnel to handle radioactive materials and requires patient specific dosing calculations 
doctors may prefer to continue to treat nhl patients with conventional therapies  in this case chemotherapy and non radiolabeled biologics 
oncologists and hematologists are not typically licensed to administer radioimmunotherapies such as bexxar therapeutic regimen and will need to engage a nuclear medicine physician or receive specialty training to administer bexxar therapeutic regimen 
nuclear regulatory commission regulations permit bexxar therapeutic regimen to be administered on an outpatient basis in most cases that we currently contemplate 
market acceptance could  however  be adversely affected to the extent hospitals are required under applicable state  local or individual hospital regulations to administer bexxar therapeutic regimen on an in patient basis 
in addition  continued expansion in the use of rituxan rituximab for maintenance therapy of nhl could affect the ability of bexxar therapeutic regimen to gain market share 
if reimbursement is inadequate or unavailable for bexxar therapeutic regimen  demand for  or prices of  bexxar therapeutic regimen may be limited and our revenues may be substantially reduced 
the affordability to patients and customers of bexxar therapeutic regimen depends substantially on whether government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies and other healthcare funders will reimburse most of the cost of the product to our customers 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products like bexxar therapeutic regimen because third party payors have very little experience upon which to model pricing and reimbursement decisions 
although we have received notification from several major third party payors that they plan to reimburse our customers for bexxar therapeutic 
table of contents regimen  including the center for medicare and medicaid services  which has published reimbursement codes specific to bexxar therapeutic regimen  in most cases we still do not know the degree to which such third party payors will reimburse the cost of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
in addition  federal and state governments in the united states  as well as foreign governments  continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare 
government cost control initiatives could decrease the reimbursement for bexxar therapeutic regimen 
for example  the us medicare program recently announced that it is considering whether to cut reimbursement for certain off label uses for bexxar therapeutic regimen 
inadequate reimbursement levels would reduce the demand for bexxar therapeutic regimen or could force us to reduce the price of bexxar therapeutic regimen to customers  or a combination of both 
reduced demand for bexxar therapeutic regimen  or reduced price  could limit our co promotion revenues from bexxar therapeutic regimen 
we may be unable to manufacture commercial quantities of bexxar therapeutic regimen for sale 
bexxar therapeutic regimen contains a radiolabeled antibody  which is an antibody linked to an isotope 
we have no existing internal capacity or experience with respect to manufacturing radiolabeled antibodies for large scale clinical trials or commercial purposes 
we have entered into agreements with nordion for radiolabeling the tositumomab component of bexxar therapeutic regimen at nordion s centralized radiolabeling facility and for supplying the i radioisotope  which nordion gets from a single source supplier 
under our agreement with amersham health  amersham health is responsible for radiolabeling the european supply of the tositumomab component of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
neither nordion nor amersham health may be able to produce sufficient radiolabeled antibodies to meet our clinical requirements and  if bexxar therapeutic regimen is a commercial success in the united states  or is approved and is a commercial success in other countries  our commercial requirements in the united states or in such other countries may exceed the capacity of our current contract manufacturers 
in addition  radiolabeled antibody cannot be stockpiled against future shortages due to the day half life of the i radioisotope 
accordingly  any interruption in supply from nordion  amersham health or another supplier could harm sales of bexxar therapeutic regimen in the united states and in other countries if and when it is approved for sale in such other countries 
we have also entered into an agreement with bi pharma kg to produce bulk tositumomab and fill the individual product vials with tositumomab 
we have contracted with bi pharma kg and a third party supplier for labeling and packaging services 
these manufacturers have limited experience producing  labeling and packaging tositumomab  and they may be unable to produce our requirements in commercial quantities or with acceptable quality 
we are aware of only a limited number of manufacturers capable of producing tositumomab in commercial quantities or radiolabeling the antibody with the i radioisotope on a commercial scale 
to establish and qualify a new facility to centrally radiolabel antibodies could take three years or longer 
accordingly  if nordion is unable to consistently produce sufficient radiolabeled antibodies to meet our commercial requirements  our ability to market bexxar therapeutic regimen in the united states could be harmed 
nordion s bexxar therapeutic regimen radiolabeling facility will be shutdown for approximately two weeks each november and or december for routine preventative maintenance 
this annual shutdown will be scheduled but we anticipate that it may have a negative impact on sales of bexxar therapeutic regimen during the period encompassing the shutdown 
if we are unable to establish or maintain distribution capabilities for bexxar therapeutic regimen  we may not successfully commercialize the product 
the unique properties of bexxar therapeutic regimen require tightly controlled distribution of the product 
we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third parties or build in house distribution capabilities to meet requirements for product supply 
if we are unable to establish or maintain these capabilities  we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product 
due to its radioactive component  bexxar therapeutic regimen is shipped in shielded containers and must arrive at its destination 
table of contents within hours after production 
bexxar therapeutic regimen must also be temperature controlled during shipment 
we rely on many third party suppliers to process orders and to package  store and ship bexxar therapeutic regimen 
we are working with suppliers to minimize risk and loss of inventory and to provide efficient service to customers 
these third party suppliers may be unable to handle bexxar therapeutic regimen in a manner that will minimize loss of or damage to inventory 
because we have limited sale and distribution capabilities  we may be unable to successfully commercialize bexxar therapeutic regimen or our other product candidates 
following the approval of bexxar therapeutic regimen in june of  we began to build our direct sales force for bexxar therapeutic regimen and anticipate having such sales force in place by the middle of our ability to market and sell bexxar therapeutic regimen will be contingent on recruiting  training and deploying the necessary sales force  as well as performance by gsk under our bexxar therapeutic regimen collaboration agreement 
developing an effective sales force will require a significant amount of our financial resources and time 
we may be unable to establish and manage an effective sales force in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all  and any sales force we do establish may not be capable of generating sales of bexxar therapeutic regimen or other product candidates 
we intend to rely on our corporate partners to market our products outside the united states and  in the case of infectious disease products  worldwide 
our corporate partners may not have effective sales forces and distribution systems 
if we are unable to maintain or establish relationships and are required to market any of our products directly  we will need to build a sales and marketing force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third parties or build in house sales and distribution capabilities 
many of our product candidates are at an early stage of product development and we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we are at an early stage in the development of the majority of our product candidates 
the development of safe and effective therapies for treating people with cancer and infectious diseases is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
product candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality or may fail to achieve market acceptance 
on june   we and gsk announced that the fda had approved bexxar therapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with cd positive  follicular  nhl  with and without transformation whose disease is refractory to rituximab and has relapsed following chemotherapy 
we also have an immunotherapeutic product that has been approved on a named patient basis in germany  spain  italy and the united kingdom 
the immunotherapeutic product incorporates mpl adjuvant  our proprietary adjuvant  which is added to the product to heighten the immune response to the product s allergens 
in addition  we have received approval in argentina to sell rc adjuvant as part of a prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis b infection 
rc adjuvant is added to the product to heighten the immune response to the product s antigens 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our other product candidates  or in commercializing bexxar therapeutic regimen or any product candidates for which approval is obtained 
our restructuring may place additional strain on our resources and may harm the morale and performance of our personnel 
on november   we announced that  as part of a strategic restructuring  we would eliminate certain research programs and supporting resources in an effort to focus on priority programs that we believe have the greatest opportunity for near term commercial success 
this restructuring reduced the scope and number of 
table of contents priority programs to allow us to concentrate more resources on our core areas of expertise monoclonal antibodies  adjuvants and vaccines and tlr agonists and antagonists 
the programs we chose to continue and on which we are focusing our resources may not result in any product candidates  whereas we will miss or fail to take advantage of opportunities that would have been presented by our discontinued programs 
we cannot be certain that we have chosen the best programs for near term commercial success 
our restructuring resulted in an approximate immediate reduction in our workforce  including the elimination of unfilled open positions  as well as existing positions 
following the workforce reduction  we had approximately employees at facilities in seattle  washington  south san francisco  california and hamilton  montana 
our restructuring plan may yield unanticipated consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce 
this workforce reduction could place significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and result in increased responsibilities for each of our management personnel 
as a result  our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities 
in addition  many of the terminated employees possess specific knowledge or expertise  and that knowledge or expertise may prove to have been important to our operations 
in that case  their absence may create significant difficulties 
in addition  this headcount reduction may subject us to the risk of litigation  which could result in substantial costs to us and could divert management s time and attention away from business operations 
our product candidates are subject to a government regulatory approval process that is uncertain  time consuming and expensive and may not result in any approved products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the approval process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate in order to study its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the indications being studied  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate 
delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials may occur  which may result in increased costs  program delays or both 
the timing and completion of current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates depend on  among other factors  the rate at which patients are enrolled  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to the clinical sites  the number of clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competing clinical trials  and the existence of alternative available products 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  we may encounter delays  or the fda may reject our product candidates  based on changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development  
table of contents extension of the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or other factors beyond our control 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect the marketing of any products we develop  could impose significant additional costs on us  would diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
for example  we filed our bla for bexxar therapeutic regimen in june and did not receive regulatory approval for bexxar therapeutic regimen until june  we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our other product candidates  or in commercializing any product candidates for which approval has been or is in the future obtained 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the approved product may be marketed 
these limitations could reduce the size of the potential market for the product 
for example  bexxar therapeutic regimen has only been approved for treatment of patients with cd positive  follicular  nhl  with and without transformation whose disease is refractory to rituximab and has relapsed following chemotherapy 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
further  manufacturers of approved products are subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations  or other fda regulations  can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
we have limited experience in manufacturing and may encounter problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
our current manufacturing facilities may not be sufficient to support our needs for clinical quantities of our product candidates or commercial quantities of our current products 
we have limited experience producing commercial quantities of any product or in producing clinical grade amounts of our proprietary immunotherapeutic products  including recombinant proteins or antibodies 
we currently manufacture only limited quantities of some antigens and several adjuvants 
moreover  our manufacturing facilities must continually adhere to cgmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda approval of our product candidates that we manufacture in house may be delayed or denied 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with cgmp regulations  the consequent lack of supply of the product candidates could delay our clinical programs  limit our sales of commercial products or result in the breach or termination of our agreements to supply products or product candidates to third parties 
we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce larger quantities of recombinant protein or other cell culture based biologicals for clinical trials and product commercialization 
either we or our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture our proprietary antigen vaccines or other immunotherapeutic products at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
third party manufacturers also may be unable to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with these manufacturers  our preclinical and clinical testing would be delayed  thereby delaying submission of products for regulatory approval  or the market introduction and commercial sale of the products 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to cgmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if the facilities of those manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda approval of our product candidates may be delayed or denied 

table of contents any claims relating to our improper handling  storage or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming and costly 
the manufacture and administration of bexxar therapeutic regimen requires the handling  use and disposal of i isotope  a radioactive isotope of iodine 
these activities must comply with various state and federal regulations 
violations of these regulations could significantly delay completion of clinical trials and commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
for our ongoing clinical trials and for commercial scale production  we currently rely on nordion to radiolabel the tositumomab with i radioisotope at a single location in canada 
violations of safety regulations could occur with nordion and there is a risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of any regulatory noncompliance or accident  the supply of radiolabeled tositumomab for use in clinical trials or commercial sales could be interrupted 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  which could harm sales of the affected products 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn  reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products or changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  sales of the affected products may drop significantly  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us  and this could result in the breach or termination of our agreements to supply product candidates to third parties 
any of the above occurrences could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these products 
because we have limited sources of revenue  our results of operations are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate partners  and we expect that most of our revenue will continue to result from corporate partnerships until the successful commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen or the approval and commercialization of other products 
payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount 
we may not receive anticipated revenue under existing corporate partnerships  and we may be unable to enter into any additional corporate partnerships 
since our inception  we have generated only minimal revenue from diagnostic product sales and no significant revenue from therapeutic or prophylactic product sales 
with the exception of bexxar therapeutic regimen  mpl adjuvant  which has been approved for sale as part of an immunotherapeutic product on a named patient basis in germany  spain  italy and the united kingdom and rc adjuvant  
table of contents which has been approved for sale in argentina as part of a prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis b infection  we cannot predict when  if ever  our research and development programs will result in commercially available immunotherapeutic products 
we do not know when  if ever  we will receive any significant revenue from commercial sales of these products or any other of our product candidates that may be approved for sale in the future 
as a result of our limited sources of revenue  our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate 
because of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful 
in addition  our operating results for a particular quarter or year may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could result in a decrease in our stock price 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception on september  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion  of which million is attributable to the write off of ipr d costs associated with our acquisitions  million is attributable to goodwill related charges and million is attributable to a lease related impairment charge 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
operating losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of the various costs associated with our acquisition activities  including the expenses associated with the write off of irp d  research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical activities 
we may never achieve profitability  and our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on our ability to successfully commercialize bexxar therapeutic regimen  enter into corporate partnerships for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and manufacture and market our products once they are approved for sale 
even if we are successful in the above activities  our operations may not be profitable 
we may need additional capital  and our ability to implement our existing financing plans and secure additional funding is uncertain 
we may be unable to raise on acceptable terms  if at all  any additional capital resources necessary to conduct our operations 
if we are unable to raise any additional capital as may be required  we may be forced to limit some or all of our research and development programs and related operations or curtail commercialization of our product candidates 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our discovery and research programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of building and maintaining a marketing and sales force  the costs of marketing a product  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  
table of contents the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and the cost of any judgment that may be enforced against us for legal fees or other costs of other parties to such claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors beyond our control 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with committed payments under existing corporate partnerships  bank credit arrangements and interest and investment income  will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  public or private debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
additional financing may be unavailable on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be forced to limit some or all of our research and development programs and related operations or curtail commercialization of our product candidates 
our financings and other transactions may result in dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 
in august  as part of a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock  we also issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share to selected institutional and other accredited investors 
in addition  in june  as part of a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock  we issued warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share to institutional investors 
if these warrants are exercised  the issuance of shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
we have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in the holders of these notes have the option of converting the principal and unpaid interest on the notes  at any time prior to the maturity date  into common stock at a fixed conversion rate of per share 
if the notes were converted in full   shares of our common stock would be issued to the noteholders  this issuance would have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
in addition to any dilution resulting from issuances under the equity line facility or upon exercise of warrants  we are also obligated  or in some cases have the option  to issue additional shares of our common stock under collaboration and other strategic agreements 
under our collaborative agreement for bexxar therapeutic regimen with gsk  gsk provided us with a million credit line that was fully drawn by coulter in december and which we may choose to repay in cash or in shares of our common stock on or prior to the october  maturity date 
under a different collaborative agreement with gsk  we have an outstanding loan from gsk in principal amount of million which was due on september  at gsk s option  gsk may choose to receive repayment of this loan in cash or shares of our common stock at a specified premium to the five day average closing price of our common stock for the period immediately preceding september  gsk has not yet made its election regarding the form of repayment and accordingly the million loan remains outstanding 
under an assignment agreement between coulter  beckman coulter  inc  interwest partners v  lp and interwest investors v  relating to portions of the technology underlying bexxar therapeutic regimen  beckman coulter  inc is entitled to receive the first million of royalties upon commercial sale of bexxar therapeutic regimen  if any  that would otherwise have been due to dfci under the licenses that were sublicensed to coulter  thereafter  any such royalties shall be payable to dfci

table of contents has the option  in lieu of receiving cash for such royalties  to receive shares of our common stock valued at the then current fair market value of our common stock 
we are also required to pay dividends on our outstanding preferred stock 
the dividend can be paid in cash or common stock  at our option 
the maximum amount of cash that would be paid in a year would be million and the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued is the issuance of additional stock under these agreements  as dividends on our preferred stock or pursuant to other transactions will have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
from time to time  we expect to enter into new partnerships  acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may agree to issue additional shares of common stock 
we have a significant amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at and due in and as of december   we had outstanding bank loans to bnp paribas and ge capital totaling million  which  along with our march  loan of million from ndc  collectively  is a significant amount of debt and debt service obligations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes  including from cash and cash equivalents on hand  we will be in default under the terms of the loan agreements  or indentures  which could  in turn  cause defaults under our other existing and future debt obligations 
these notes also could have a negative effect on our earnings per share  depending on the rate of interest we earn on cash balances 
even if we are able to meet our debt service obligations  the amount of debt we have could adversely affect us in a number of ways  including by limiting our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  or other purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who have lower levels of debt  making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally  or requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash to pay principal and interest on our debt  instead of contributing those funds to other purposes such as working capital and capital expenditures 
in addition  we could lose the tax deduction for interest expense associated with the convertible notes if  under certain circumstances  we issue senior unsecured debt or incur any obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets of a newly acquired corporation 
we also could lose the tax deduction for interest expense associated with the convertible notes if we were to invest in non taxable investments 
if our corporate partnerships are unsuccessful or if we are unable to establish corporate partnerships in the future  our revenue growth and product development may be limited 
the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous relationships that may result from this strategy 
for the years ended december   and  approximately of our revenue resulted from collaboration agreements 
if our corporate partnerships are unsuccessful or if we are unable to establish corporate partnerships  we may be prevented from commercializing our products or product candidates or effectively partnering our products or product candidates 
our licenses  in combination with our proprietary discoveries  enable us to enter into partnerships to progress some of our product candidates 
our corporate partnerships generally provide our partners with the 
table of contents right to use technologies owned or licensed by us in research  development and commercialization activities 
our material corporate partnerships include the following a corporate partnership with gsk to develop and commercialize bexxar therapeutic regimen in the united states  a license and supply agreement with gsk canada to commercialize bexxar therapeutic regimen in canada  a corporate partnership with amersham health to develop and commercialize bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe  a corporate partnership with kirin for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at treating multiple forms of cancer  including leukemia  myelodysplasia and melanoma  a corporate partnership with zambon for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing and treating lung cancer  a corporate partnership with gsk that provides for vaccine development of breast  prostate and colon cancer vaccines  vaccine discovery and development for tuberculosis  and vaccine discovery programs for two chronic infectious pathogens  chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumonia  and several license and supply agreements with gsk  which grant gsk licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for infectious diseases  cancers and allergies that gsk is developing 
management of our relationships with our corporate partners requires significant time and effort from our management team  coordination of our research with the research priorities of our corporate partners  effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects  and an ability to attract and retain key management  scientific and other personnel 
our corporate partners may terminate our current partnerships 
our agreements with gsk for commercialization of bexxar therapeutic regimen in the united states  amersham health for marketing bexxar therapeutic regimen in europe and gsk canada for marketing bexxar therapeutic regimen in canada contain milestone based termination provisions that provide that if we fail to meet specified development or regulatory milestones  the licensor may terminate the agreement 
in addition  all of these license agreements may be terminated by the licensor for our material breach or insolvency  or after a specified termination date 
some of our corporate partners have options to license aspects of our technology 
any of these corporate partners may not exercise its option to license this technology 
the process of establishing new corporate partnerships is difficult and time consuming 
our discussions with potential partners may not lead to the establishment of new corporate partnerships on favorable terms  if at all 
if we successfully establish new corporate partnerships  such partnerships may never result in the successful development of our product candidates or the generation of significant revenue 
because we generally enter into research and development collaborations with corporate partners at an early stage of product development  our success largely depends on the performance of our corporate partners 
we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our corporate partners to collaborative activities 
our corporate partners may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs or the commercialization of our products and product candidates 
if any corporate partner fails to commit sufficient resources  our preclinical or clinical development related to the corporate partnership could be delayed or terminated 
also  our current corporate partners or future corporate partners  if any  may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 

table of contents our inability to license technology from third parties or our inability to maintain exclusive licenses may impair our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
our success also depends on our ability to enter into and maintain licensing arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology that is advantageous or necessary to developing and commercializing our product candidates 
if we cannot obtain or maintain these licenses on acceptable terms  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or in license similar technology 
if we are unable to do so  we may be prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates 
we currently have various license agreements that provide us rights to use technologies owned or licensed by third parties in research  development and commercialization activities 
our material third party licensing arrangements include the following a license with the dfci for the use of the anti b antibody used in bexxar therapeutic regimen  and a license with the university of michigan related to using anti cd antibodies in radioimmunotherapy of lymphoma 
many of our third party license agreements contain milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure to meet any agreed milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement 
further  we may be unable to negotiate additional license agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
many of our license agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies 
if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates or face competition from other parties that may obtain licenses to the same technologies 
if we are unable to obtain  protect and enforce our patent rights  we may be unable to effectively protect or exploit our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain  protect and enforce commercially valuable patents 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements  our competitors could develop and commercialize products that would otherwise infringe our patents 
we try to protect our proprietary positions by filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to developing our business 
our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields are still evolving 
accordingly  the degree of future protection for our patent rights is uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection  we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage  other parties may challenge patents licensed or issued to us  disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us  our licensors  corporate partners and other scientific collaborators  and other parties may design around our patented technologies 
we have licensed several patent applications from southern research institute  or sri  related to our microsphere encapsulation technology 
one of these patent applications is currently the subject of opposition proceedings before the european patent office 
the european patent office has revoked the previously issued 
table of contents european patent 
although sri has appealed this decision  it is uncertain whether sri will prevail in this opposition proceeding 
as a result  this patent may not issue in europe 
biogen idec has challenged the validity of our us patent nos 
      and  related to bexxar therapeutic regimen by seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity of these patents 
biogen idec is also seeking a declaratory judgment that its zevalin product for the treatment of nhl is not infringing the patents 
we  gsk and the regents of the university of michigan are parties to a lawsuit against biogen idec alleging patent infringement of our us patent nos 
   and  by zevalin and seeking monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief 
claims in the patents at issue in the litigation cover composition of matter and methods of use in the treatment of nhl 
on october   the united states district court  southern district of california granted biogen idec s motion for summary judgment that the    and  patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the united states patent and trademark office 
on november  corixa  gsk and the regents of the university of michigan filed a motion for reconsideration with the united states district court  southern district of california requesting that the court reconsider it s october  order 
on january   the united states district court  southern district of california granted the motion for reconsideration  vacated the october  order and denied biogen idec s motion for summary judgment of inequitable conduct 
on june   biogen idec moved to amend its complaint to add a claim for declaratory judgment relief of non infringement and invalidity of our us patent no 
 issued patent no 
 covers composition of matter used in the treatment of nhl 
on that same day  biogen idec also filed a separate lawsuit in the united states district court  southern district of california  seeking declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity of this same patent 
on august   the judge denied biogen idec s motion to amend the complaint to include this patent in the originally filed lawsuit or  alternatively  to consolidate the first filed lawsuit with the one filed on june  subsequently  on december   biogen idec filed with the united states district court  southern district of california  a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice for the june  lawsuit 
in addition  on february   biogen idec filed a complaint in the united states district court  southern district of california  against us and gsk for patent infringement of us reissue patent no 
re  which claims  among other things  methods of enhancing the delivery of conjugated specific antibodies to solid tumor target cells 
on march  we announced that we and gsk have reached a settlement with biogen idec regarding all outstanding patent litigation between us and biogen idec 
the settlement  which serves as the basis for the dismissal of all patent litigation between the parties  provides for biogen idec to pay to us and gsk a million upfront settlement payment  as well as a one time milestone payment based on future zevalin sales performance  and royalty payments on zevalin sales from january  until the expiration of all bexxar therapeutic regimen patents that were the subject of the litigation 
we and gsk will also enter into a worldwide  cross license agreement with biogen idec relating to each party s patents in suit 
if we are unable to gain access to patent and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to gain access to third party patent and proprietary rights and to operate our business without infringing on third party patent rights 
we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize our product candidates 
licenses required under third party patents or proprietary rights may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we do not obtain the required licenses  we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to redesign products or methods or we could be unable to develop  manufacture or sell products requiring these licenses 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our trade secrets  we may be unable to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect trade secrets that are not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection 
to protect our trade secrets  we rely primarily on confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements and research agreements 
nevertheless  other parties may develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies that are not protected by patents  or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
other parties may breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts we have entered into  and we may not become aware of  or have adequate remedies in the event of  any breach 
any material leak of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could harm our competitive position 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks  we may be unable to compete effectively 
we try to protect our trademarks by applying for united states and foreign registrations for marks that are important to developing our business 
however  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and effective trademark protection may not be available in other jurisdictions 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks  we may be unable to establish brand awareness for our products  which could limit our ability to compete effectively 
of our trademarks  corixa and mpl are currently the subject of opposition proceedings before the office for the harmonization in the internal market  which handles initial prosecution and opposition of european trademarks 
we may not ultimately prevail in these opposition proceedings 
as a result  we may not receive trademark protection for corixa and mpl in europe 
our trademark application in canada for enhanzyn is currently the subject of an opposition proceeding before the canadian intellectual property office 
we may not ultimately prevail in this opposition proceeding 
as a result  we may not receive trademark protection for enhanzyn in canada 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights owned or used by us may be costly and time consuming 
as a result of litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings and other administrative proceedings in which we are or may become involved  we have incurred substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities  allow our competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from us  or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain such licenses  we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates 
as a result  an adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the enforcement  defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  these proceedings are costly and time consuming  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to defend against third party claims of infringement  enforce our issued and licensed patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
if we do not successfully integrate potential future acquisitions  we may incur unexpected costs and disruptions to our business 
we have completed several acquisitions of complementary technologies  product candidates and businesses 
in the future  we may acquire additional complementary companies  products and product 
table of contents candidates or technologies 
managing these acquisitions has entailed and may in the future entail numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including exposure to unknown liabilities  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs  difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our operations and personnel  disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention to integrating or completing the development or commercialization of any acquired technologies  impairment of relationships with key customers of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership  inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses  and increased amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant intangible assets or potential write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets due to impairment of the assets 
for example  in december we acquired coulter  a publicly held biotechnology company specializing in  among other things  the development of therapeutic antibodies  including bexxar therapeutic regimen 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter  we acquired direct sales and marketing personnel in preparation for the launch of bexxar therapeutic regimen 
in an effort to minimize expenses during the delay in the fda review of bexxar therapeutic regimen  we initiated expense reductions  including a reduction in total headcount in march the majority of these reductions took place in the operations that we acquired from coulter 
during the first quarter of  we experienced a decrease in the value of our common stock subsequent to receiving the complete review letter from the fda regarding the bexxar therapeutic regimen bla 
as a result  goodwill and other intangibles were re evaluated and we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
bexxar therapeutic regimen may not be successful in the marketplace  in which case we may not gain substantial benefit from the coulter acquisition 
in may  we sold specific preclinical assets and equipment that we acquired from coulter to medarex and  in connection with the asset sale  initiated a further headcount reduction 
we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of any of whom could impair our ability to compete 
the loss of the services of any of the principal members of our management and scientific staff could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives 
competition among biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense  and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to our success 
we may be unable to attract and retain these individuals currently or in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
we also have relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our research  development or clinical strategy 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these scientific collaborators and can generally expect these individuals to devote only limited amounts of time to our activities 
failure of any of these persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs could harm our business 
in addition  these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist the companies in developing technologies that may compete with our products 

table of contents if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries  our business will fail 
the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive  and we may be unable to compete effectively in these industries 
many companies and institutions compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat or prevent cancer and infectious diseases  including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions  and research organizations 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical development  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research and development  manufacturing  and preclinical and clinical development  and obtain regulatory approval of and market products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring and developing technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  product price  and patent position 
competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or may achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization  than we do 
these competitive products may achieve a greater market share or render our products obsolete 
biogen idec s product  zevalin  received fda approval for commercial sale in the united states in february zevalin has been approved and is being marketed for the treatment of certain types of nhl in the united states 
in addition  in january  the committee for proprietary medicinal products  a scientific committee that reviews drug product applications for the european union  approved the commercial sales of zevalin in europe 
consequently  biogen idec could have a significant advantage over us in sales and marketing of products for the treatment of nhl in the united states and the european union 
our stock price could be very volatile and shares of our common stock may suffer a decline in value the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
as a result of the fluctuations in the price of our common stock you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common 
table of contents stock may be subject to substantial volatility depending on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  progress or delay of our or our competitors regulatory approvals  announcements regarding the acquisition of technologies or companies by us or our competitors  changes in our existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of additional corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements by us or our competitors  technological innovations or new commercial products developed by us or our competitors  changes in our or our competitors intellectual property portfolio  developments or disputes concerning our or our competitors proprietary rights  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports and their recommendations regarding us or our competitors  changes in government regulations  economic and other external factors  additions or departures of any of our key personnel  operating losses by us  and actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results and degree of trading liquidity in our common stock 
our common stock has traded as high as and as low as since the beginning of the last reported sales price of our common stock on march  was 
if our stock price declines significantly  we may be unable to raise additional capital 
significant declines in the price of our common stock could also impede our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and reduce the liquidity of our common stock 
product liability claims may damage our reputation and if insurance proves inadequate  the product liability claims may harm our financial position 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims inherent in manufacturing  testing and marketing therapies for treating people with cancer and infectious diseases 
a product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about a product s safety and efficacy and could limit our ability to sell one or more products by preventing or interfering with product commercialization 
although we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable  this coverage may be inadequate or may be unavailable in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  defending a suit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and could divert management attention 
state laws and our certificate of incorporation may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware and washington law  will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial for our stockholders 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock 
for example  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws allow our board to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  
table of contents eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to call a special meeting  specify restrictive procedures for director nominations by stockholders  and specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to change the number of directors 
we are subject to certain provisions of delaware and washington law  which could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
in particular  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met 
similarly  chapter b 
of the washington business corporation act prohibits corporations based in washington from engaging in certain business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of five years unless specific conditions are met 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware and washington law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
