item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over an extended period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its market share of worldwide proppant sales 
while the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative products  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity in recent years 
the company believes its future prospects will benefit from both an expected increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to lower their overall development costs 
recently  the company has expanded its operations outside the united states 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues  respectively  over the past three years 
in the company constructed a manufacturing plant in china  its first plant located outside the united states  and currently is constructing a second production line that will double the capacity of this plant 
the company recently established a subsidiary company and opened two sales offices in russia  and by mid expects to establish a warehouse there 
the company believes international operations will represent an increasingly important role in its future growth 
revenue growth in recent years has been driven primarily by increases in sales volume 
because the company s products compete in part against lower cost alternatives  price increases for the company s products have been minimal in recent years and the company expects future growth will continue to be dependent on increasing sales volume 
as a result  the company has initiated construction of significant new manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated future demand 
the company s gross profit margins are principally impacted by natural gas costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
while most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  natural gas  which is the fuel used to fire the kilns in which ceramic proppant is made  has varied from approximately to of total direct production costs over the last two years due to the price volatility of this fuel source 
the company s practice had been to purchase its estimated annual natural gas requirement in the spring of each year 
however  beginning in  the company has initiated a program to purchase its natural gas requirement at various times during the year  in order to average the cost and reduce exposure to short term spikes in commodity prices 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by this fuel  future changes in net income may not be proportionate to changes in revenue 
over the past five years  the company has expanded its production capacity by 
while the company has operated near full capacity for much of this period  the addition of significant new capacity in the future could adversely impact gross profit and operating margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
however  the company believes that the addition of this capacity is a key component to continuing long term growth in sales volume and revenue 
as the company s sales volume has increased  there has also been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of revenue in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  focusing on new product development  and increasing international activities 
the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue and that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will not change significantly 
general business conditions the company s business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the higher cost of ceramic proppant to the future value derived from increased production rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
natural gas prices and drilling activity in the north american market have been highly variable over the past three years 
the north american natural gas market remained very strong through the first half of as a result of the strong market conditions in north america  the company established new annual records for sales volume  average selling price  revenues and net income in despite a downturn in north american natural gas drilling activity in the second half of the year 
this decline in north american drilling activity continued through much of in  the average natural gas rig count declined by in the us and in canada compared to in  activity levels in north america rebounded and the company established new sales volume records in a number of regions including the us rocky mountains  canada and east texas 
in addition  the company experienced significant sales growth in overseas markets due to an increase in drilling and fracturing activity in europe and asia 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer upon delivery 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
as stated in note to the consolidated financial statements  credit losses historically have been insignificant 
therefore  except in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  the company generally does not record a reserve for bad debts 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  its estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at cost 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of an acquired enterprise is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
if necessary  these estimates can be revised during an allocation period when information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed a period of one year from the date of acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the purchase price allocation would be adjusted accordingly 
should information become available after the allocation period  the effects would be reflected in operating results 
results of operations percent percent change change in thousands net income the company s net income for was higher than the previous year 
a strong north american natural gas market and increased demand for proppants in russia and china were the driving forces behind a significant increase in net income for the year 
the us natural gas rig count increased steadily throughout  ending the year above the year end rig count 
while activity in the traditionally strong ceramic proppant markets in south texas and the gulf of mexico remained relatively flat compared to  the company saw increasing demand in the rockies  canada and east texas 
in addition to increased revenues  improved operating efficiency in its manufacturing facilities contributed to the increase in net income 
the company reported net income for that was lower than the previous year 
the primary factor contributing to the reduction in net income was a significant decrease in north american gas drilling activity that began in the second half of and continued into the average domestic natural gas rig count for was lower than  while the average price of natural gas in the us decreased by from the previous year 
the reduction in revenues  increased manufacturing costs and increased selling  general and administrative expenses contributed to the decline in net income 
individual components of operating results are discussed below 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands revenues revenues in of million were higher than the increase was driven primarily by a increase in sales volume  with domestic sales volume up and international sales volume up 
worldwide sales volume of million pounds during established a new annual record 
sales volume in canada increased by and sales volume outside of north america increased by compared to significant increases in overseas sales volume occurred in russia and china 
the worldwide sales increase is largely attributable to a increase in the average worldwide rig count from to  the addition of the plant in luoyang  china  which commenced operations in january  and continued success with the company s technical marketing efforts 
the average selling price per pound of ceramic proppant for was compared to for the decline in average selling price was due to an increase in sales of lower priced  light weight ceramic proppant products 
revenues for also included a full year of pinnacle operations compared to only seven months in the company acquired pinnacle on may  and has consolidated its results since that date 
the company s revenues in of million were lower than revenues 
revenues in included million from pinnacle 
total proppant sales volume decreased by  with domestic volume down and export volume down by  despite a drop in the us rig count and a decline in the average worldwide rig count compared to the company believes that these relatively strong results in a weak market indicate that the company s ceramic proppants continued to gain market share due to the success of the company s technical marketing program and expanded distribution network 
the decreased domestic volume was due to a drop in sales in south texas  while decreased export sales were attributable to reduced sales into south america  australia  and mexico 
increased sales in russia and canada offset some of the export declines 
the average selling price of per pound in improved slightly versus per pound in gross profit percent percent change change in thousands gross profit gross profit the company s cost of sales consists of manufacturing costs and packaging and transportation expenses associated with the delivery of the company s products to its customers 
variable manufacturing expenses include raw materials  labor  utilities and repair and maintenance supplies 
fixed manufacturing expenses include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
certain handling costs related to maintaining finished goods inventory and operating the company s remote stocking facilities are charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
those costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross profit increased by from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  compared to for the improvement in gross profit was the result of both the significant increase in sales volume as well as increases in sales of higher margin products 
improved efficiency in manufacturing and distribution operations contributed to increased gross profit margins 
manufacturing facilities operated at of capacity in versus of capacity in partially offsetting this improvement was the effect of higher natural gas costs in manufacturing operations 
continued improvement in distribution performance resulted in lower freight cost to transport finished goods from plants to remote storage locations 
gross profit decreased by from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  compared to for the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to reduced sales volume 
the reduction in gross profit margins was directly related to the company s manufacturing facilities operating at approximately of capacity in versus of capacity in this was caused by both reduced sales volumes and unscheduled downtime at the mcintyre production facility due to unanticipated maintenance requirements 
the impact of this was partially offset by the lower cost of natural gas used at the manufacturing facilities during and reduced freight costs in transporting finished goods from the plants to remote storage locations 
selling  general administrative expenses and other operating expenses percent percent change change in thousands sg a sg a as a of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses increased by million in over and  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in to in the increase was due to the consolidation of expenses of pinnacle technologies  inc for the full year in and increased spending related to distribution  marketing  business development and research activities 
other operating expenses in also include a million write off for equipment disposed of during the expansion of the mcintyre facility and million start up costs related to production expansions 
the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to start up costs and a legal reserve incurred during  which represented of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses increased by million in over sg a and start up expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in the most significant items were start up costs related to the new manufacturing facility in china and a  reserve related to a judgment against the company in a lawsuit alleging tortious interference with a contract 
excluding the china start up expenses and legal judgment reserve in and a million non recurring  non cash stock based compensation charge related to the modification of the expiration date of fully vested stock options in connection with the retirement of the company s former president in  sg a expenses increased by million in this increase relates directly to the expansion of the company s distribution network  new business development costs  increased costs for additional personnel in its administrative functions  and expenses of pinnacle technologies

the company generated cash from operations of million and realized proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock for exercises of employee stock options 
total capital expenditures for the year were million  cash dividends paid totaled million  and million was paid to former pinnacle shareholders in respect of amounts withheld at the time of the pinnacle acquisition pursuant to the pinnacle acquisition agreement 
major capital spending items during included spending on improvements at the mcintyre manufacturing facility to debottleneck the current production process and improve equipment reliability in order to increase production capacity  equipment for pinnacle operations  partial construction of a second production line at the manufacturing plant in china and various improvements and additions to other manufacturing facilities 
the company s current intention  subject to its financial condition  the amount of funds generated from operations and the level of capital expenditures  is to continue to pay quarterly dividends to holders of its common stock 
the company maintains an unsecured line of credit of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
the company anticipates that cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses  tax obligations and capital expenditures through also  based on the strength of its balance sheet  the company believes that it could acquire additional debt financing  if necessary 
based on these assumptions  the company believes that its fixed costs could be met even with a moderate decrease in demand for the company s products

see note and note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses natural gas to power its domestic manufacturing plants 
from time to time the company enters into contracts to purchase a portion of the anticipated natural gas requirements 
the contracts are at specified prices and are typically short term in duration 
as of december   the last contract was due to expire october  the company has entered into contracts to supply raw materials  primarily kaolin and bauxite  to each of its manufacturing plants 
each of the contracts is described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
three of the contracts do not require annual minimum purchase commitments  but do require the purchase of minimum percentages of annual raw material requirements  ranging from to of the respective plants total raw materials purchases 
one of the contracts requires annual minimum purchase commitments  which are included in the above table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact its investment in china 
when necessary  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
there were no such foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company has a million line of credit with its primary commercial bank 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company may elect to pay interest at either a fluctuating base rate established by the bank from time to time or at a rate based on the rate established in the london inter bank market 
the company does not believe that it has any material exposure to market risk associated with interest rates
