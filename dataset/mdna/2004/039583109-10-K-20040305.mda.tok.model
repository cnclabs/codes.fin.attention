item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company we are engaged primarily in the acquisition  development  management and operation of apartment communities throughout the united states 
we are structured as an upreit  under which substantially all property ownership and business operations are conducted through the operating trust and our subsidiaries 
table of contents and affiliates 
archstone smith is the sole trustee of the operating trust and owned approximately of our common units at december  the smith merger during october  shareholders of both archstone and smith residential a publicly traded reit which primarily developed  owned and managed high rise apartment properties and garden apartment communities in washington  dc  chicago  boston and southeast florida approved the smith merger 
the combined company operates under the name archstone smith operating trust 
our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange nyse asn 
the total purchase price paid for smith residential aggregated approximately billion and corresponds to a purchase price of approximately  per operating apartment unit acquired 
this transaction was structured as a tax free merger and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations overview in conjunction with our capital recycling strategy  rental revenues and rental expense  including real estate taxes will fluctuate based upon the timing and amount of dispositions  acquisitions and development lease ups 
as a result  in addition to the performance of our same store portfolio  disposition gains  and the corresponding loss of ongoing income from disposed assets  as well as the new income generated from acquisitions and developments  all contribute to the overall financial performance of archstone smith 
basic net earnings attributable to common shares increased approximately million  or  in as compared to this increase is largely attributable to an increase in gains during of million as compared to million during  associated with an increase in the dispositions of depreciated real estate assets  lower interest expense associated with lower debt extinguishment costs and lower debt balances during and a reduction in interest rates on floating rate debt and refinanced debt  a reduction in preferred share dividends during due to the conversion of series a and series h preferred shares into common shares in and the conversion of series j preferred shares into common shares and the redemption of series a preferred shares during  and increased rental revenue and corresponding increase in rental expense due to the acquisition of operating communities and the continued lease up and stabilization of development communities 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in rental revenue from our same store portfolio of for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the same store population excludes all ameriton communities  primarily due to a decline in potential effective rent per unit and a decrease in average occupancy  the loss of rental revenue and a corresponding decrease in rental expense due to billion and million in dispositions during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and an increase of million in expense associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold during as compared to basic net earnings attributable to common shares increased approximately million  or  in as compared to this increase is largely attributable to an increase in overall rental revenue and a corresponding increase in rental expense due to the acquisition of properties in the smith merger  
table of contents a million gain on the sale of ces  an unconsolidated entity acquired in the smith merger  and increased gains from the disposition of real estate during of million as compared to million during as well as unconsolidated entities acquired in the smith merger  and increased rental revenue and a corresponding increase in rental expense due to the acquisition of operating communities and the continued lease up and stabilization of development communities 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of rental revenue and a corresponding decrease in rental expense in due to the billion of garden community dispositions in non core markets during including archstone smith joint venture transactions and million of dispositions in  same store rental revenue decline of due primarily to a decline in potential effective rent per unit  same store rental expense increase of in as compared to primarily due to increase in real estate taxes  insurance  make ready and personnel expenses  higher depreciation  interest and general and administrative expenses due principally to the smith merger  charges of million relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at one of our high rise properties in southeast florida during the third and fourth quarters of  and a million increase in debt extinguishments costs due to the prepayment of mortgages 
our strongest core markets based on same store revenue growth during included southern california and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
the san francisco bay area  seattle and chicago continued to present the greatest challenges for revenue growth 

table of contents apartment community operations we utilize net operating income noi as the primary measure to evaluate the performance of our operating communities 
noi is defined as rental revenues less rental expense and real estate taxes for each of our operating properties 
we rely on noi for purposes of making decisions about resource allocations and assessing segment performance 
we also believe noi is a valuable means of comparing period to period property performance 
the following is a reconciliation of same store noi to earnings from operations in thousands same store noi noi for properties not in same store including ameriton properties  which are not included in discontinued operations noi classified as discontinued operations communities sold noi classified as discontinued operations communities held for sale smith noi prior to merger included in same store calculation net operating income other income depreciation on real estate investments interest expense general and administrative expenses other expense earnings from operations at december   investments in operating apartment communities comprised over of our total real estate portfolio  based on noi

table of contents high rise properties rental revenues property operating expenses net operating income average number of operating units operating margin net operating income rental revenues average occupancy percentage net earnings from discontinued operations have been reclassified for all years presented 
high rise properties were acquired in the smith merger on october  therefore  includes only months of operating results 
noi for the entire apartment portfolio  including properties reported in discontinued operations  decreased by million  or  during as compared to this decrease was principally attributable to a decline in rental revenue from our same store portfolio of for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the same store population excludes all ameriton communities  primarily due to a decline in potential effective rent per unit and a decrease in average occupancy  and the loss of rental revenue and the corresponding decrease in rental expense due to billion and million in dispositions during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by increased revenue from the acquisition of operating communities and the continued lease up and stabilization of development communities 
noi for the entire apartment portfolio  including properties reported in discontinued operations  increased by million  or  during as compared to these increases were principally attributable to the inclusion of a full year of rental revenue and rental expense from high rise properties acquired in the smith merger  the continued successful lease up and stabilization of apartment communities  and  the acquisition of seven apartment communities in these increases were partially offset by the loss of rental revenue and the corresponding decrease in rental expense due to billion of dispositions in and million of dispositions in  and declining same store revenue  combined with increases in property taxes and insurance

we anticipate same store noi growth to be flat to negative two percent during we view job growth as one of the most important drivers of demand in our business 
if job growth does not begin to improve throughout  the assumptions mentioned above may prove to be overly optimistic 
conversely  if we experience substantial job growth earlier in the year  our assumptions may be conservative 
other income other income increased by million  or in as compared to this increase is principally attributable to the collection of contingent proceeds related to indemnification of certain ces accounts receivable over days and dividend income on stock investments 
other income decreased by million  or  in as compared to this decrease is principally attributable to lower interest income caused by lower restricted cash balances because of reduced disposition activity  coupled with lower interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by higher fee income from our joint ventures 
depreciation expense the million  or decrease in depreciation expense  including properties reported in discontinued operations  in as compared to is due principally to increased disposition activity during the million  or increase in depreciation expense  including properties reported in discontinued operations  in as compared to is due principally to additional depreciation expense associated with properties acquired in the smith merger 
interest expense the million  or  decrease in interest expense  including interest on properties reported in discontinued operations in as compared to  is the result of lower debt balances  a reduction in interest rates on floating rate debt and refinanced debt  and the repayment of long term unsecured debt with proceeds from our unsecured credit facilities  which were at lower average interest rates during the period 

table of contents the million  or  increase in interest expense  including interest on properties reported in discontinued operations  in as compared to is the result of the incremental debt assumed in the smith merger  which was partially offset by a lower average cost of variable rate debt 
capitalized interest increased due to an increase in the number of properties under construction from the addition of properties acquired in the smith merger 
general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to relates primarily to additional severance costs and legal fees incurred during  as well as increased depreciation of capitalized costs associated with our new rm program called lro tm and our new on site property management software 
the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to relates primarily to the incremental overhead incurred in connection with the smith merger 
in addition  the amortization of capitalized costs associated with our new rm program called lro tm  which began in december  contributed to the increase in other expenses the million  or increase in other expense in as compared to is primarily related to an increase in moisture infiltration and resulting mold costs and a million increase in ameriton income taxes 
the moisture infiltration costs pertain to estimated and incurred legal fees and estimated settlement costs  additional residential property repair and replacement costs and temporary resident relocation expenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower merger integration costs associated with the smith merger as well as lower pursuit cost write offs during the million  or increase in other expense in as compared to is primarily related to an increase in moisture infiltration costs and a million increase in ameriton income taxes 
the moisture infiltration costs pertain to estimated and incurred legal fees and estimated settlement costs  additional residential property repair and replacement costs and temporary resident relocation expenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower merger integration costs associated with the smith merger 
income from unconsolidated entities income from unconsolidated entities decreased by million in as compared to primarily due to the gain on sale of ces recognized in december income from unconsolidated entities increased by million in as compared to primarily as a result of the following factors the million increase in net earnings from ces and smc  both acquired in the smith merger  the million gain on sale of ces to a third party in december  and the million increase in our share of the net earnings from real estate joint ventures 
this increase is primarily due to the formation of three operating community joint ventures during and three joint ventures acquired in the smith merger 
preferred share distributions preferred share distributions decreased by million  or during as compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the conversion of series a and series h preferred shares into common shares in and the conversion of series j preferred shares into common shares during  as well as the redemption of the series c preferred shares in the decrease in preferred share distributions due to conversions was off set by an increase in common share dividends 

table of contents preferred share distributions increased by million  or  in as compared to due to the issuance of series h  i  j  k and l preferred shares in connection with the smith merger and the treatment of share issuance costs associated with the redemption of series b preferred shares as additional distributions 
this increase was partially offset by the redemption of the series c preferred shares in august and lower dividends on series a preferred shares resulting from periodic conversions into common shares by shareholders 
discontinued operations for properties accounted for as discontinued operations  the results of operations sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that were classified as discontinued operations include rental revenue  rental expense  real estate tax  depreciation expense  minority interest and interest expense actual interest expense for encumbered properties and a pro rata allocation of interest expense for any unencumbered portion up to our weighted average leverage ratio  as well as the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale 
consistent with our capital recycling program  we had operating apartment communities  representing  units unaudited  classified as held for sale under the provisions of sfas  at december  accordingly  we have classified the operating earnings from these properties within discontinued operations for the years ended december   and during the twelve months ended december   we sold operating communities 
the operating results of these communities and the related gain loss on sale are also included in discontinued operations for  and lastly  discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  include the net operating results of operating communities and one retail property which were sold during four apartment communities that were sold during were held for sale at december   and therefore gains and related operating income for these dispositions are not classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas the following is a summary of net earnings from discontinued operations in thousands years ended december  rental revenues rental expenses real estate taxes depreciation on real estate investments interest expense provision for possible loss on real estate investment allocation of minority interest gain on dispositions of real estate investments  net the portion of interest expense included in discontinued operations that is allocated to properties based on the company s leverage ratio was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gains on dispositions of real estate investments we recognized million  million and million of net gains on the disposition of depreciated real estate assets including properties reported in discontinued operations  during  and  respectively 
these gains have resulted from our capital redeployment program  which involves the disposition of operating communities in non core markets with less attractive growth prospects to fund investments in our core protected markets  and opportunistic dispositions by ameriton 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial flexibility we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility  which we believe enhances our ability to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities as they become available 
as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations  cash positions at december   the available capacity under our unsecured credit facilities  and anticipated proceeds from the forward sale of marketable equity securities to be settled during  we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs in operating activities our net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  during as compared to this decrease was principally due to lower net earnings before gains on the disposition of depreciated real estate and payment of expenses related to remediation of moisture infiltration and resulting mold that were accrued in previous years 
our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million  or  in as compared to  principally due to an increase in earnings from operations due to the smith merger  which was partially offset by lower same store revenue and lost revenue and a corresponding decrease in rental expense resulting from our and disposition activity 
for a more complete discussion of the factors affecting our operating performance  see our accompanying statement of cash flows in this annual report 
investing and financing activities during  cash flows provided by investing activities increased by approximately million or 
this increase was primary attributable to a million increase in proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets and a reduction in cash used to purchase marketable securities during as compared to this was partially offset by an increase in the balance of our tax deferred escrow account and a million decreased cash flow from unconsolidated entities 
during  cash flows from investing activities decreased million or as compared to the decrease was principally attributable to a million reduction in proceeds from dispositions  a million increase in investments in real estate  and an increase in purchases of marketable securities and other assets 
these decreases were partially offset by the million increase in cash flows from restricted cash in tax deferred exchange escrow  a million increase in cash flows from our investment in and advances to our unconsolidated investees and other investing activities 
during  cash used in financing activities increased by million or  as compared to this is principally due to a million net reduction in our unsecured credit facility and a million reduction in the total proceeds received from long term unsecured debt offerings 
this increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a million reduction in principal payments on mortgages payable 
during  cash used in financing activities decreased million  or  as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to the issuance of senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of million during and the million increase in the net proceeds provided by our credit facilities used to finance investing activities 
these increases were partially offset by principal prepayments on mortgages payable  including prepayment penalties  which increased million and dividends and distributions on common shares  preferred shares and minority interest in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  during as compared to million  million and million  respectively  during

see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional information on scheduled debt maturities 
in october  we completed the renewal of our unsecured revolving credit facility provided by a group of financial institutions led by jpmorgan chase bank

table of contents planned investments following is a summary of planned investments as of december   including amounts for ameriton dollar amounts in thousands 
the amounts labeled discretionary represent future investments that we plan to make  although there is not a contractual commitment to do so 
the amounts labeled committed represent the approximate amount that we are contractually committed to fund for communities under construction in accordance with construction contracts with general contractors 
planned investments units discretionary committed communities under redevelopment communities under construction communities in planning and owned communities in planning and under control community acquisitions under contract total in addition to the planned investments noted above  we expect to make additional investments relating to planned expenditures on recently acquired communities as well as recurring expenditures to improve and maintain our established operating communities 
we anticipate completion of most of the communities that are currently under construction and the planned operating community improvements during and we expect to start construction on approximately million  based on total expected investment  of communities that are currently in planning  in we expect to fund the costs of these development projects over a two to three year period following the date construction commences 
no assurances can be given that communities we do not currently own will be acquired or that planned developments will actually occur 
in addition  actual costs incurred could be greater or less than our current estimates 
funding sources we anticipate financing our planned investment and operating needs primarily with cash flow from operating activities  disposition proceeds from our capital redeployment program and borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities  prior to arranging long term financing 
consistent with our performance in  we anticipate that net cash flow from operating activities during will be sufficient to fund anticipated distribution requirements and debt principal amortization payments 
to fund planned investment activities  we had million in available capacity on our unsecured credit facilities and approximately million of cash on hand at february  in addition  we expect to complete the disposition of million of operating communities during during  we will receive approximately million from the sale of certain marketable securities in accordance with our forward sales agreement

table of contents as of february   archstone smith and the operating trust collectively have billion available in shelf registered securities which can be issued based on our ability to affect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing market conditions 
litigation and contingencies during  we accrued or incurred a liability for million relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues at harbour house  a high rise property in southeast florida that became subject to litigation in the third quarter of of this amount  million represents amounts expensed for the estimated cost of repairing or replacing residents property  temporary resident relocation expenses and incurred legal fees 
the remaining million represents costs capitalized in accordance with gaap pertaining to remediation and capital improvements to the building 
during  we recorded additional costs of million for moisture infiltration and resulting mold at harbour house 
of this amount  million represents amounts expensed for estimated and incurred legal fees associated with known and anticipated costs for archstone smith s counsel and plaintiffs counsel  as well as estimated settlement costs based upon the settlement agreement  additional resident property repair and replacement costs and temporary resident relocation expenses 
the estimated settlement accrual is inclusive of all pending legal claims at this property other than for those individuals who have opted out of the settlement and are pursuing or may pursue individual claims 
the remaining million pertains to an increase in our accrual estimate for capitalized costs associated with remediation and capital improvements 
as of december   total cash payments related to moisture infiltration and mold remediation at this property were million 
we anticipate incurring the remaining million over the next six to twelve months 
the harbour house accrual represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and is based  in part  on estimates obtained from third party contractors and actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as better information becomes available 
not all plaintiffs have accepted the court approved settlement  which could result in further court proceedings and potential legal fees and damages not contemplated in our current accrual 
it is not possible to predict the likelihood of claims by individuals who have opted out of the settlement  nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of any potential loss related to these claims 
we are also party to alleged moisture infiltration and resulting mold lawsuits at other apartment properties 
we believe these suits are without merit  nonetheless  in certain instances we have negotiated a settlement with certain of the plaintiffs in an effort to expedite the resolution of their claims and avoid potentially protracted litigation and associated attorney s fees 
during we expensed approximately million for estimated and incurred legal fees associated with known and anticipated costs for archstone smith s counsel and plaintiffs counsel  as well as estimated settlement costs based upon the status of discussions  additional resident property repair and replacement costs and temporary resident relocation expenses pertaining to these claims 
these estimates represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and are based  in part  on estimates obtained from third party contractors and actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as better information becomes available 
not all plaintiffs have accepted the negotiated settlement  and further court proceedings and additional legal fees and damages may be required to fully resolve these claims 
we have not accrued for renovation and equipment upgrades at these properties  as these costs are part of our previously existing and ongoing plans and not a result of the legal claims 
accordingly  we will capitalize or expense costs associated with these issues as they are incurred  in accordance with gaap 
we are aggressively pursuing recovery of a significant portion of these costs from our insurance carriers 
as of december   we have received approximately million of initial insurance recoveries pertaining to moisture infiltration and resulting mold claims 
we are still in discussions with our insurance providers and therefore no estimate for future insurance recoveries has been recorded 
in addition  we are continuing to pursue potential recoveries from third parties who we believe bear responsibility for a considerable portion of the costs we have incurred 
we cannot make assurances that we will obtain these 
table of contents recoveries or that our ultimate liability associated with these claims will not be material to our results of operations 
we are a party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that the results of any such claims or litigation  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has discussed the development and selection of all of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to these policies 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas internal cost capitalization we have an investment organization that is responsible for development and redevelopment of apartment communities 
consistent with gaap  all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during development and redevelopment activities are capitalized 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 
because the estimation of capitalizable internal costs requires management s judgment  we believe internal cost capitalization is a critical accounting estimate 
if future accounting rules limit our ability to capitalize internal costs or if our development activity decreased significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  there could be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if hypothetically  we were to reduce our development and land acquisition activity by with no corresponding decrease in internal costs  our net earnings per common share could decrease by approximately or based on amounts 
valuation of real estate long lived assets to be held and used are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
we also evaluate assets for potential impairment when we deem them to be held for sale 
valuation of real estate is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value  and therefore  the carrying amounts of our real estate 
when determining if there is an indication of impairment  we estimate the asset s noi over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted cash flow basis and compare this amount to its carrying value 
estimating the expected noi and holding period requires significant management judgment 
if it is determined that there is an indication of impairment for assets to be held and used  or if an asset is deemed to be held for sale  we then determine the asset s fair value 
the apartment industry uses capitalization rates as the primary measure of fair value 
specifically  annual noi for a community is divided by an estimated capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the community 
determining the appropriate capitalization rate requires significant judgment and is typically based on the prevailing rate for the market or submarket 
further  capitalization rates can fluctuate up or down due to a variety of factors in the overall economy or within local markets 
if the actual capitalization rate for a community is significantly different from our estimated rate  the impairment evaluation for an individual 
table of contents asset could be materially affected 
for example  we would value a community with annual noi of million at million using a capitalization rate  whereas that same community would be valued at million if the actual capitalization rate were 
historically we have had limited and infrequent impairment charges  and the majority of our apartment community sales have produced gains 
for example  we have sold approximately billion of real estate assets excluding ameriton over the last eight years  which produced million in gains at an unleveraged internal rate of return of approximately 
we evaluate a real estate asset for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
capital expenditures and depreciable lives we incur costs relating to redevelopment initiatives  revenue enhancing and expense reducing capital expenditures  and recurring capital expenditures that are capitalized as part of our real estate 
these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives determined by management 
we allocate the cost of newly acquired properties between net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
the primary intangible asset associated with an apartment community acquisition is the value of the existing lease agreements 
when allocating cost to an acquired property  we first allocate costs to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land  building and fixtures assuming the property is vacant 
we estimate the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease up 
we depreciate the building and fixtures based on the expected useful life of the asset and amortize the intangible value of the lease agreements over the average remaining life of the existing leases 
determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization  the assignment of depreciable lives and determining the appropriate amounts to allocate between tangible and intangible assets for property acquisitions requires our management to exercise significant judgment and is therefore considered a significant accounting estimate 
total capital expenditures were and of weighted average gross real estate as of december  and  respectively 
the growth in capital expenditures was principally due to significant redevelopment efforts in our high rise portfolio acquired in the smith merger 
additionally  depreciation expense as a percentage of depreciable real estate was  and or  and per share for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if the actual weighted average useful life were determined to be one year shorter or longer than management s current estimate  our annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease approximately or per common share 
see note in our audited financial statements in this annual report for additional detail on depreciable lives 
pursuit costs we incur costs relating to the potential acquisition of real estate which we refer to as pursuit costs 
to the extent that these costs are identifiable with a specific property and would be capitalized if the property were already acquired  the costs are accumulated by project and capitalized in the other asset section of the balance sheet 
if these conditions are not met  the costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs include but are not limited to earnest money  option fees  environmental reports  traffic reports  surveys  photos  blueprints  direct and incremental personnel costs and legal costs 
upon acquisition  the costs are included in the basis of the acquired property 
when it becomes probable that a prospective acquisition will not be acquired  the accumulated costs for the property are charged to other expense on the statement of earnings in the period such a determination is made 
because of the inherent judgment involved in evaluating whether a prospective property will ultimately be acquired  we believe capitalizable pursuit costs are a critical accounting estimate 
if it were determined that a quarter of our prospective acquisitions were deemed improbable as of december   other expense for the year ended december  would increase approximately or per share  excluding refundable earnest money 

table of contents moisture infiltration and mold remediation costs accounting for correction of moisture infiltration and mold remediation costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required by management to determine when to record a liability  how much should be accrued as a liability and whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization 
we estimate and accrue costs related to correcting the moisture infiltration and remediating resulting mold when we anticipate incurring costs because of the threat of litigation or the assertion of a legal claim 
when we incur costs at our own discretion  the cost is recognized as incurred 
moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation costs are only capitalized when it is determined by management that such remediation costs also extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of the property relative to when the community was originally constructed or acquired  if later 
all other related costs are expensed 
there are considerable uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate the ultimate cost of correction and remediation efforts 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  assessing the exact nature and extent of the issues  the extent of required remediation efforts and the varying costs of alternative strategies for addressing the issues 
any accrual represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs and is based  in part  on estimates obtained from third party contractors and actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as better information becomes available 
we accrue for litigation settlement costs when a loss contingency is both probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimating the likelihood and amount of a loss contingency requires significant judgment by management and is therefore considered a critical accounting estimate 
we base these estimates on the best information available as of the end of the period  which includes  but is not limited to  estimates obtained from third party contractors as well as actual costs incurred to date 
it is possible that these estimates could increase or decrease as better information becomes available

this interpretation replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january and clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements 
fin r requires us to consolidate our existing variable interest entities in which we have the majority variable interest 
due to the adoption of this interpretation  we have consolidated the results of ameriton  for all periods presented 
we have evaluated all other joint ventures and found there to be no material impact 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in december  the fasb issued sfas no

the adoption of sfas revised did not have a material impact on our financial position  net earnings or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk stock investments we have both public and private investments in equity securities 
the publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the private investments  for which we lack the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for at cost 
declines in the value of public and private investments that our management determines are other than temporary  are recorded as a provision for possible loss on investments 
our evaluation of the carrying value of these investments is primarily based upon a regular review of market valuations if available  each company s operating performance and assumptions underlying cash flow forecasts 
in addition  our management considers events and circumstances that may signal the impairment of an investment 
during  we concluded that our investments in private service and technology companies were impaired due to the financial position of the investees 
since the decline was deemed to be other than temporary  we recorded a million provision for possible loss on investments during use of derivatives in hedging activities we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and will occasionally utilize interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as hedges with the objective of lowering our overall borrowing costs 
these derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
we are also exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of certain equity securities 
we have entered into forward sale agreements to protect against a reduction in the fair value of these securities 
we have designated this forward sale as a fair value hedge 
we do not use these derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes 
further  as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when 
table of contents viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not  nor do we expect to sustain a material loss from the use of these hedging instruments 
we formally assess  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
we measure hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative instrument with the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
we exclude the hedging instrument s time value component when assessing hedge effectiveness 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market value conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
these methods and assumptions include standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost and termination cost 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and therefore  are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts that we could realize upon disposition 
during the rd quarter of  we entered into a forward sale agreement with a notional amount  which represents the fair value of the underlying marketable securities  of approximately million 
in the th quarter of  we entered into two additional forward sale agreements with a notional amount of approximately million 
the forward sales agreements fair value at december  and were  and  respectively 
the sale of certain marketable securities in accordance with forward sale contracts is expected to result in realized gains of approximately million in the following table summarizes the notional amount  carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments  as of december  dollar amounts in thousands

moreover  because there were no firm commitments to actually sell these instruments at fair value as of december   the information presented herein is an estimate and has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  if any  will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  hedging strategies  prevailing interest rates and other market factors existing at the time
