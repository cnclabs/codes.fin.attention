overview since our inception in january  we have been engaged primarily in the design and development and more recently the manufacture and sale of noninvasive  advanced medical products 
our products  which incorporate proprietary materials and electronics technology  are used in neurological monitoring applications 
our principal product is the patient state analyzer psa with the psarray  which is the frontal only disposable array sensor which attaches to and is used with our psa consciousness monitoring system 
we received k clearance from the fda for the psarray in october the psarray was developed in an effort to improve market acceptance of the psa we have a limited history of operations and have experienced significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the introduction of the psa  the introduction of alternative means for neurophysiological monitoring and competition 
results of operations will also be affected by the progress of clinical trials and in house development activities  and the extent to which we establish distribution channels for our products domestically and internationally 
since the third quarter of  substantially all of our sales were to baxter healthcare corporation baxter under a distribution agreement  which provides baxter with exclusive distribution rights to our psa in the united states 
the agreement extends through september   but is cancelable by either party upon six months notice after december  under the terms of the agreement  as amended in february  if baxter fails to meet minimum purchase commitments  we have the option to convert their distribution agreement into a non exclusive relationship for the or market segment 
in  baxter failed to meet minimum purchase requirements  however  we currently do not have any intention to enforce our right to change the terms of the agreement  including baxter s exclusivity rights 
on february   we received clearance from the food and drug administration fda for commercial distribution of our psa next generation monitor 
the psa is a new state of the art monitor that is more powerful  cost effective and ergonomic than its predecessor the psa we anticipate launch of the product through our exclusive distribution partner  baxter healthcare baxter  in late or early in critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the most critical accounting policies are as follows use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require that we make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates are made in connection with determining the market value of inventory  if lower than cost  and establishing allowances for bad debts 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales upon shipment  net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns which are also provided for at the time of shipment in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
we review our inventories for excess and obsolete inventory on a periodic basis 
on february   we received clearance from the food and drug administration fda for commercial distribution of our psa next generation monitor 
the psa is a new state of the art monitor that is more powerful  cost effective and ergonomic than its predecessor the psa we anticipate launch of the product through our exclusive distribution partner  baxter healthcare baxter  in late or early in at december   we had psa units on hand with units on hand fully reserved for 
these items were reserved in prior years due to concerns as to the saleability of the units given uncertainty as to market acceptance 
in the event we sell in excess of units up to units  we will recognize gross margin on these shipments 
warrant derivative we had a derivative liability as of december  which resulted from a potential cash settlement which was required in the event we could not successfully register the shares underlying the warrants 
the warrants were issued in connection with our common stock financing during december we account for this warrant derivative in accordance with eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the warrants are included as a liability and valued at fair market value until we meet the criteria under eitf for equity 
stock based compensation we apply the principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock plans 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is measured as the difference  if any  between the option exercise price and the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we have historically granted options to employees and directors at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for our employee stock based compensation plans 
we follow the disclosure only provisions under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of psa units shipped during we did not ship any psa units during as compared to units shipped in revenue of  recognized in represented the removal of an acceptance contingency on units shipped to baxter during the improved revenues in were also due to the introduction of the psarray  which received fda k clearance on october  shipments to baxter of the psarray during accounted for revenue of  as compared to revenue of  for future psa revenues are entirely dependent on the acceptance of the new psarray by anesthesiologists 
there is no assurance that this will occur 
sales of our hydrodot neuromonitoring products decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of products sold cost of products sold increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increased volume of psa and psarray units shipped in compared to gross deficit the gross deficit incurred during the years ended december  and resulted from costs of the product incurred together with headcount and overhead costs required in our manufacturing group exceeding the reported revenues 
at december   we had psa units on hand with units on hand fully reserved for 
in the event we sell in excess of psa units up to units  we will recognize gross margin on these shipments 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consisting principally of headcount related expenses  clinical study costs  and consulting fees  decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in outside consulting costs associated with development of the psa  as well as staff reductions and other discretionary expense reductions undertaken in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  there were no significant changes in these expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  change in fair value of warrant derivative during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash expense of  related to warrants issued in connection with our common stock financing in december in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the warrants are included as a liability and valued at fair market value until the company meets the criteria under eitf for equity 
the warrants were classified as a derivative and recorded as a liability due to the possibility of the company having to make a cash settlement  including penalties  in the event we failed to register the shares underlying the warrants under the securities act of  as amended  within days after the closing of the private placement transaction 
we valued the warrant derivative using the black scholes model 
a registration statement covering the shares sold in the private placement  along with the shares underlying the warrants  was filed with the securities and exchange commission on form s and declared effective on february  therefore  the value of the warrants will be reclassified as equity in the first quarter of we expect to incur a non cash charge in the first quarter of for the change in the fair value of the derivative up to the date the derivative is transferred into equity 
interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower average cash balances available for investment in  along with lower interest rates 
income taxes we have experienced operating losses since inception and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances  in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  were established in each period to reflect these uncertainties 
years ended december  and revenues revenues decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to lack of sales of the psa monitor during we did not ship any psa units during as compared to units shipped in we recognized revenue of  during the fourth quarter of related to the removal of an acceptance contingency on units shipped to baxter during the reduced level of revenues in was due to baxter s decision not to purchase any additional psa units during due to lower than expected market demand and in anticipation of the commercial release of the psarrray  a new frontal only disposable array sensor which attaches to and is used with our psa system 
the psarray  which received fda k clearance on october   was developed in an effort to improve market acceptance of the psa initial shipments to baxter of the psarray during the fourth quarter of accounted for revenue of  future psa revenues are entirely dependent on the acceptance of the new psarray by anesthesiologists 
there is no assurance that this will occur 
sales of our hydrodot neuromonitoring products increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of products sold cost of products sold decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased product costs related to the psa units in  coupled with a provision for excess inventory of million in and the recognition of a loss on fixed purchase commitments in excess of expected demand during the charge in was a result of baxter s failure to meet its minimum purchase requirements under the distribution agreement  which created uncertainty as to the future sales volume of the psa gross profit deficit the negative gross profit margin incurred during the year ended december  resulted from costs of the product incurred together with headcount and overhead costs required in our manufacturing group exceeding the reported revenues 
staff reductions undertaken in april of have lowered expenses in the reduction in the negative gross margin in was also due to  of revenue recognized in related to the removal of an acceptance contingency in for which the related cost of sales was recorded in the costs were recorded in due to the uncertainty as to the acceptance of the units 
the negative gross profit margin incurred during the year ended december  resulted from selling psa units at a volume less than what was needed to cover fixed and variable costs in our manufacturing department as well as the provision for excess inventory of million taken during the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses consisting principally of headcount related expenses  clinical study costs  and consulting fees  decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in outside consulting costs associated with development of the psa  as well as staff reductions and other discretionary expense reductions undertaken in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to decreased sales and marketing expenses incurred  such as travel  headcount related expenses and outside market research consulting related to the commercialization of the psa additionally  we incurred investment banking fees in which were not incurred in interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower average cash balances available for investment in  along with lower interest rates 
income taxes we have experienced operating losses since inception and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception

    gross margin deficit     operating loss     net loss     basic and diluted net loss per share during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash expense of  related to a warrant derivative issued in connection with our common stock financing in december  which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  as compared to  at december  our operating activities used cash of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  the operating activities for included a non cash expense of  related to the derivative accounting treatment of warrants issued in connection with our private placement completed in december the  decrease in net cash used in compared to was a result of a large decrease in inventory due to the sale of psa units in coupled with a large increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments for certain items  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was  as compared with  provided in the year ended december  the use of cash in was due primarily to the net purchase of short term investments of million in our financing activities provided cash of  in the year ended december  as compared to of cash provided in the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we completed a private placement of common stock that raised million in net proceeds 
as part of the private placement  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
of the  shares of common stock   shares have a purchase price of per share   shares have a purchase price of per share  and  shares  issued to the placement agents for the transaction  have a purchase price of per share 
the warrants expire on december  and are exercisable immediately 
our principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which aggregated million 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at december   which is due primarily to warrant derivatives issued in connection with our common stock financing during december  which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants were classified as derivatives due to the possibility of the company having to make a cash settlement  including penalties  in the event we failed to register the shares underlying the warrants under the securities act of  as amended  within days after the closing of the private placement transaction 
a registration statement covering the shares sold in the private placement  along with the shares underlying the warrants  was filed with the securities and exchange commission on form s and declared effective on february  therefore  the value of the warrants has been reclassified as equity in the first quarter of and there is no future cash requirement with respect to this liability on behalf of the company 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at december  will be sufficient to conduct operations as planned through the third quarter of we are significantly dependent on our distributor  baxter  for sale of our inventories and have not provided any additional inventory valuation reserves based upon baxter s current intention to purchase such inventories  although baxter is not under any obligation to do so 
in the event such sales do not materialize  we will assess the need to write down our inventories to net realizable value during such periods  and additionally  our cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we may need to raise capital through equity and or debt issuance when  and if  such capital is available to us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
future equity financings may result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
future debt financings may require us to pledge assets and to comply with financial and operational covenants 
if additional amounts can not be raised at acceptable terms and we were unable to substantially reduce our expenses  we would suffer material adverse consequences to our business  financial condition and results of operations and would likely be required to seek other alternatives up to and including protection under the united states bankruptcy laws or cessation of operations 
we believe that the success of the psa is the most critical component to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we intend to sell the psa through our existing distributor  baxter  in north america and pursue a distributor for rest of the world rights 
therefore our ability to generate additional revenues and commercialize the psa significantly depends upon our relationship with baxter 
although management and our current investors do not have any intention of liquidating the business  we would consider a sale of its technology if our cash constraints would not allow us to execute our plan 
we are aware of one other company with products similar to the psa such competitor has an fda cleared frontal array for its consciousness monitoring system 
we believe that we are not at a significant disadvantage in marketing our products against this company 
we have a  net investment in inventory  after reserves  related to the psa system 
the sale of this inventory may be subject to conditions that are generally outside our control 
more specifically  market acceptance of the psarray  a new frontal only disposable array sensor that attaches to and is used with our psa system  is critical to the sale of the finished units that are currently in inventory 
we believe that inventory units on hand included in our balance sheet at december  are fully realizable and are expected to be sold within the next twelve months 
on february   we received clearance from the fda for commercial distribution of our psa next generation monitor 
the psa is a new state of the art monitor that is more powerful  cost effective and ergonomic than its predecessor the psa we anticipate launch of the product through our exclusive distribution partner  baxter healthcare  in late or early we intend to manage the transition of the products to facilitate utilization and sale of all psa monitors 
at december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset federal taxable income  which expire in varying amounts through  and million to offset state taxable income  which expire in varying amounts through we also have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset income taxes  which expire in varying amounts through in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of the above carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon ownership changes of our stock which have occurred 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  in december  the fasb deferred the effective date of fin to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  for those arrangements involving special purpose entities entered into prior to february  all other arrangements within the scope of fin are subject to its provisions beginning in the company adopted fin  as required  with no material impact to its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company does not believe that the adoption of the remaining provisions of fin in will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet financing we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less 
in connection with our private placement transaction completed in  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the terms of the private placement required the company to register with the securities and exchange commission the shares sold in the private placement  including the shares underlying the warrants  and provided for the possibility of the company having to pay out certain cash penalties in the event we failed to register such shares underlying the warrants within days after the closing of the private placement transaction 
accordingly  this resulted in a derivative contract in accordance with eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the warrants are included as a liability and valued at fair market value until we meet the criteria under eitf for permanent equity 
we value the derivative warrant using the black scholes model 
the derivative was valued at the date of the transaction in the amount of million and then revalued at million on december  the relevant assumptions included in the calculation were a term of years  an interest rate of and a volatility of 
the value of this derivative will fluctuate with the value of our stock and as assumptions under the black scholes model changes at the end of each reporting period or at the date the derivative is reclassified into equity 
a registration statement covering the shares underlying the warrants  was filed with the securities and exchange commission on form s on december   and declared effective on february  and the value of the warrants will be included in equity in the first quarter of we expect to incur a non cash charge in the first quarter of for the change in the fair value of the derivative up to the date the derivative is transferred into equity
