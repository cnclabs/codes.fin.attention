item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support consumer demand for electronic products  followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
during  these markets experienced historically high growth rates and reached record volume levels 
however  in early the electronics capital equipment markets experienced a significant decline that continued through and into early in the third quarter of  our two largest electronic assembly sensor customers  which had accounted for of our revenue in  virtually ceased ordering product and have only begun ordering significant quantities of product again in similarly  because of significant decline in semiconductor production and drastic decline in capital equipment purchased by semiconductor fabricators  our semiconductor products  which are sold primarily to capital equipment suppliers to the semiconductor business  declined significantly 
this prolonged market decline resulted in significant price pressure on both consumer electronics products and on capital equipment suppliers  resulting in a migration of worldwide electronics production capacity to low cost geographies in asia and eastern europe 
this drive to reduce manufacturing costs has also impacted pricing levels on our products  requiring us to invest in cost reduction initiatives and in sg a resources to support growing asian sales volumes 
our operating results have been heavily impacted by these market conditions  resulting in net losses during the period of to in response to declining revenues and operating losses  we have taken aggressive cost reduction actions during   and  including reducing our worldwide employment by over from peaks  and closing or downsizing facilities 
nevertheless  in order to continue new product development initiatives required to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace  as well as to continue to support existing products and make investments in asia  we were not able to reduce our expense structure to keep pace with the dramatic reduction in revenue levels until the fourth quarter of when we returned to profitability 
further compounding these market effects  we determined during that  based on accounting guidance  we were required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  eliminating a significant portion of the tax benefit that would be recorded against pre tax losses 
during we have significantly improved our operating results  as quarterly revenues have grown sequentially from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
in addition we returned to profitability in the fourth quarter reporting net income of  or per share  which included a  charge for restructuring costs 
revenue growth in is the result of both improvement in market conditions and the success of new and improved products developed over the past three years 
the return to profitability is a result of both higher revenue levels and a more efficient organization with a much lower cost structure 
our balance sheet is also well positioned as a result of effective management of working capital and other assets over the past three years 
we have no debt and our cash and marketable securities are million at december  compared to million at december  we generated million of cash in  primarily from operating activities 
we believe that cash reserves are sufficient to fund operations and to make investments such as new product development initiatives 
results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues our revenues increased by to million in from million in  and decreased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands oem solutions electronic assembly sensors    semiconductor products    smt systems    total    revenues from our electronic assembly sensors products increased million or during compared to  and decreased million or during compared to during  revenues from electronic assembly sensors  primarily our laseralign sensors  were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment and by the introduction of two new sensors for one of our large customers 
these sensors were designed for the latest generation pick and place machine of this customer  which was introduced during an earlier version of this machine  which is still being sold  also incorporated our sensors  but the new machine will have higher content of our products per machine 
during  revenues were negatively impacted by the depressed market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment 
this slowdown began in the first half of and continued throughout and early the market impact was compounded by the relatively large inventory of laseralign sensors that had been accumulated by our two principal customers during  resulting in virtually no new orders from those customers during the second half and early in the second and third quarters of  these two customers began ordering new sensors  but the order rates were depressed by overall weakness in the smt capital equipment markets 
revenues from semiconductor products including revenues from imagenation frame grabber products for semiconductor and other applications decreased  or in compared to  following a decrease of  or in compared to the decrease in was primarily the result of lower frame grabber revenues  reflecting a technology change away from analog frame grabbers like those we sell and weakness in the general industrial capital equipment market 
revenues from wafer mapping sensors were approximately flat with as a result of improved market conditions in the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets in the later part of the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of lower revenues from wafer mapping sensors reflecting market weakness 
revenues from products developed by imagenation for broader industrial application were flat in compared to revenues from our smt systems products increased million or during compared to and decreased million or during compared to during  revenues from smt systems  primarily our se solder paste inspection system were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the smt capital equipment markets and by success in selling systems to many of the large manufacturers of circuit boards in asia particularly china 
a large portion of the worldwide production capacity for printed circuit boards is being added in china  and we have been successful in selling inspection systems to new and existing customers in that region 
during  revenues from smt systems suffered from the same market conditions as our other product groups and were also impacted by significant price pressure 
smt systems revenue levels in and were not as volatile as in our other product groups due to new product introductions and the success of those products in a depressed market 
the se and the ks series products generated initial revenue in the fourth quarter of the market acceptance of these products  particularly the se  allowed for relatively modest revenue declines in a severely depressed market during and and have been the primary reason for growth in we believe that increasing use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards has caused increased demand for our inspection equipment 
international revenue totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising  and of total revenue  respectively 
the international markets of china and the rest of asia  japan and europe account for a significant portion of the production capability of capital equipment for the manufacture of electronics  the primary market for our electronic assembly sensor and smt system product lines 
gross margin gross margin increased to of sales in from in and in gross margin is highly dependent on the level of revenues and resulting production levels over which to spread fixed manufacturing costs such as facilities and other compensation and non compensation expenses that do not vary with activity levels 
in addition  with higher production volumes  manufacturing processes become more efficient and reduce the overall cost of producing products for sale 
revenue levels increased in compared to and declined in compared to  and although we have reduced costs as part of cost reduction actions in an effort to better match manufacturing costs with volume levels  the volatility of revenues over the past three years has had a significant impact on gross margin 
in addition  during increased revenues from electronic assembly sensors  which increased in compared to and carry higher gross margins than smt systems products  as well as significantly reduced obsolete inventory expense and cost reduction actions  including workforce reductions  contributed to higher gross margins 
these positive factors were somewhat offset by continued price pressure on both smt systems and electronic assembly sensor products  as weak market conditions and the drive to reduce manufacturing costs in the smt electronic assembly capital equipment market over the past three years has had a negative impact on the selling price of our products 
during  gross margins were negatively impacted by a higher proportion of revenues from systems products and the decision to discontinue  over time  the sales of certain older version smt systems  which resulted in increased reserves for obsolete inventory on these older systems 
if revenue  particularly higher gross margin revenue from our electronic assembly sensor and semiconductor products  continues to improve  we expect incremental improvement in our gross margins in compared to research and development expenses we reduced our research and development expenses in by to million  and reduced those expenses by to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in  compared to in and in the and reductions in research and development expense are primarily the result of a series of cost reduction initiatives implemented during the past three years 
research and development expenses were maintained at relatively high levels through the first half of as cyberoptics continued to fund several new product development initiatives on important new products even as revenues levels declined significantly 
cost reduction measures implemented during the second quarter of enabled us to significantly reduce research and development expenses  which have since been maintained at approximately current levels 
during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on initial development activities for several new sensor products  including development activities on the new embedded process verification sensor family epv  continued development of the se and ks series inspection systems  next generation laseralign products  board alignment and on head linescan cameras and enhancements to the semiconductor wafer mapping sensor product family 
customer funded research and development is recognized as a reduction of research and development expense 
during  customer funded research and development expense totaled  compared to  in and million in as the result of cost reduction actions implemented in  we have budgeted research and development expenditures to be slightly lower in as compared to however  we are currently considering several additional projects and may increase expenditures based on an assessment of the future revenue and profit potential of new products and our expected operating results relative to our budget 
selling  general and administrative expenses we reduced our selling  general and administrative expenses by to million in  and reduced those expenses by to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in  compared to in and in the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in and were primarily due to the effect of cost reduction measures implemented over the past three years  which primarily included workforce reductions and related costs and reductions in other discretionary spending 
these spending reductions were offset somewhat by investments made to develop the end user sales and service channel in asia  including the costs of opening and operating our singapore sales office since may to better serve asian markets 
restructuring and severance costs we have implemented a series of workforce reductions over the past three years  closed our facility in california  downsized facilities in the uk and minneapolis and made other reductions in discretionary spending designed to reduce the losses and negative cash flow resulting from the severe decline in our revenues caused by the depressed capital equipment markets for suppliers to electronics manufacturing 
in addition  we are in the process of implementing a planned consolidation of uk r d operations to our minneapolis headquarters 
in december  we completed the buy out of our uk facility lease effective in the first quarter of following this buyout  we signed a new lease for less space in the same facility 
the cost of the buy out  paid in december  was approximately  in addition  during december we permanently vacated approximately  square feet of our primary minneapolis facility and recorded a restructure charge of approximately  for future lease payments reduced for estimated sub lease income of approximately  and related costs 
in september  we incurred approximately  of severance and costs associated with restructuring measures 
cost reduction measures included workforce reductions associated with downsizing direct sales and marketing resources in north america and europe  the consolidation of uk r d operations into our minneapolis headquarters and other general cost reduction measures 
severance costs were associated with a planned workforce reduction of people 
of these costs  approximately  were paid as of december  severance and associated costs of  were accrued as of december  remaining costs will be paid during the first nine months of in january  we incurred approximately  of severance costs and facility closure costs associated with further consolidation of our semiconductor product group from redwood city  california to portland  oregon 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
substantially all of these costs were paid as of march  in june  we incurred approximately  of severance and related costs associated with cost reduction measures 
cost reduction measures included a workforce reduction  and discretionary spending reductions 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
approximately  of these costs were paid as of december  severance costs of approximately  were accrued as of december   and substantially paid as of june  in january  we incurred approximately  of severance costs associated with cost reduction measures 
cost reduction measures included a workforce reduction  discretionary spending reductions  and the consolidation of semiconductor product manufacturing in portland  oregon 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
approximately  of these costs were paid as of december  facility exit and severance costs of  were accrued as of december  and all were paid in january in april  we incurred approximately  of severance related costs associated with cost reduction measures 
in september  the company incurred approximately  of additional severance related costs associated with a second round of cost reduction measures 
a total of and employees were terminated in april and september  respectively 
substantially all of these costs were paid as of december  employee termination benefits lease commitment costs other total restructuring liability  december  initial expense and accrual   cash payments   restructuring liability  december  initial expense and accrual  cash payments  restructuring liability  december  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in amortization during and is attributed to the adoption of the goodwill non amortization provisions of sfas no 
which eliminated the systematic amortization of the approximately million balance of goodwill 
amortization is primarily attributable to developed technology  patents  trademarks and other assets acquired from kestra ltd 
and hama laboratories inc during the second quarter of and from imagenation corporation during the fourth quarter of amortization of these intangible assets is expected to be approximately million in during the third quarter of  the amortization of certain intangible assets established as the result of the acquisition of hama laboratories  inc in was accelerated 
the asset values were originally established through an independent appraisal  and related to product lines and core technologies that were determined to be non strategic during the third quarter of these general purpose sensor product lines will be discontinued over the next few quarters  and consequently  amortization of the developed technology was accelerated 
the acceleration of the amortization resulted in approximately  of additional amortization expense during the third quarter of effective tax rate we recorded a tax provision of  in resulting from tax on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
there was no tax benefit recorded on us based operating losses in as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in we recorded a tax benefit of million in resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was substantially lower than the us statutory tax rate of primarily as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets during the third quarter of see disclosure in critical accounting policies and estimates and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the tax benefit and effective income tax benefit rate in were impacted by establishing valuation allowances of approximately million  offsetting deferred tax assets that require future taxable income to be realized 
of the million valuation allowance established in  million represents deferred tax assets established in prior years with the balance reflecting deferred tax assets generated as the result of taxable losses 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in  resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development tax credits 
these benefits were partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization  and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carry forwards generated by cyberoptics uk  ltd 
formerly kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
interest income and other interest income and other primarily includes interest earned on investments 
interest income declined during compared to as a result of declining interest rates on invested funds 
in addition  during  we reduced the carrying value of a million loan to avanti optics corporation  a related party  by our ownership percentage in the cumulative losses of avanti  which resulted in a charge of million remaining carrying value of loan was written off in exchange for assets received in the liquidation of avanti during 
interest income and other was higher in  primarily as a result of higher investment balances and higher interest rates 
foreign currency translation charges and certain other expenses are also included in interest income and other 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased by  during  primarily because of the purchase of million of marketable securities  net of maturities of marketable securities during  and the purchase of  of capital assets  offset by million of cash generated by operating activities and  of cash generated from financing activities 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities and investment of cash balances resulting from those maturities  or from other sources of cash  in additional to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
our combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  we generated million of cash from operations during we used cash in operations primarily to fund a net loss of million  which included a  gain from a technology transfer and license agreement and million of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and other non cash items  and to fund a million increase in accounts receivable 
these uses of cash were more than offset by a million reduction in income taxes receivable  a million reduction in inventory and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
reduced income taxes receivable are the result of refunds received during from the carry back of losses to prior year tax returns 
reduced inventory  increased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses are primarily the result of increased revenue levels during the second half of  as well as focused programs to bring down inventory balances 
we used million of cash from operations during  primarily due to a net loss of million  which included million of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence  equity in losses of avanti  establishing a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other non cash items 
cash used by operations included a million increase in accounts receivable  a  decrease in accounts payable and a  increase in taxes receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable in was primarily due to growing revenues at the end of the year and the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to reduced inventory purchases and operating expenses 
the increase in taxes receivable was the result of tax losses in that was collected as a refund from taxes paid in prior years  offset by tax refunds of approximately million received in these items were offset somewhat by  of inventory reductions and by an increase of  in accrued expenses 
reduced inventory is primarily the result of increased revenue in the second half of and increased accrued expenses are primarily due to approximately  of facility and severance costs associated with workforce reductions and other cost reduction measures implemented in we used million of cash in investing activities during compared to generating million in cash used in investing activities during includes million of net purchases of marketable securities and  for the acquisition of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs  offset somewhat by  of cash from the technology transfer and license agreement relating to our drs sensor family 
cash used in investing activities in includes million for the loan to avanti optics corporation  a related party and  for the acquisition of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
these uses were more than offset by net maturities of marketable securities that generated approximately million in we generated  of cash from financing activities in  and generated  in during and  all of the cash was generated by common stock related transactions  primarily stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan share purchases 
we used  to repurchase stock and for other financing activities in compared to  in we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash and equivalents and investments totaled million at december  with this level of cash and cash equivalents  and the fact that we began generating net profits and cash at the end of  we believe that cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations borrowings non cancelable operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations    purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
related party transactions on april   we loaned million to avanti optics corporation avanti  a company founded by steven k 
case  our chairman  founder and a significant shareholder of cyberoptics 
erwin kelen  one of our directors  also served as director of avanti  was a shareholder in avanti  and was a representative of one of the principal venture capital investors in avanti 
we held approximately of the outstanding capital stock of avanti prior to the loan  which we had acquired in consideration of the contribution of  cash and intellectual property to avanti when avanti was formed 
the loan transaction was approved by our board of directors without the participation of dr 
case or mr 
kelen and only after a determination that the loan was in our best interests 
the loan was represented by a convertible promissory note that bore interest at above the prime rate of interest and was repayable on april   or upon an earlier event of default 
the loan was secured by all of the intellectual property of avanti consisting primarily of rights in united states patents and patent applications in the area of photonics component manufacture  and provided us with the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute manual and semi automated equipment for the assembly of surface mountable optical components that were under development by avanti 
during  we reduced the carrying value of the term loan by  to reflect our equity in the cumulative losses of avanti and to reduce our investment to reflect its net realizable value as of december  in december  we were notified that  as a result of not being able to raise additional third party funding  avanti decided to cease operations and liquidate its remaining assets 
in february  avanti s board of directors and its significant shareholders passed a resolution to cease business operations 
consequently  all of the avanti intellectual property rights were transferred to us under the terms of the loan 
at december   there is no remaining carrying value for the loan 
inflation and foreign currency translation our revenue has declined during the past three years primarily because of decreases in the level of unit shipments resulting from a down turn in the worldwide electronics capital equipment market 
we believe that inflation has not had any significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
as a result of the kestra acquisition  we have a sales and software development office located in the uk 
we also opened a sales office in singapore during we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure an amendment of fas sfas no 

this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we intend to continue to account for stock based compensation to our employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
we have made certain disclosures required by sfas no 
in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and began making the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
in the first quarter of accordingly  adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interests 
the interpretation is intended to provide guidance in judging multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation outlines disclosure requirements for variable interest entities in existence prior to january  and outlines consolidation requirements for variable interest entities created after january  we do not have investments or relationships with third parties subject to the requirements of this interpretation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  income taxes  and restructuring costs 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the provision for warranties is  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a provision for obsolete and excess inventory of approximately million 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors management considers important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair value utilizing several methodologies  including consideration of our market capitalization and discounted cash flows  in determining a reasonable valuation 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record this valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and full utilization of our loss carryback potential in from the third quarter of fiscal to date  we have continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for this valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
we expect to continue to provide a full valuation allowance financial statements will not reflect a tax provision on us based income or benefit on us based losses until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
at that time  the valuation allowance will be reassessed  and could be eliminated  resulting in recognition of deferred taxes 
we anticipate a nominal tax provision related to foreign operating results 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance were million and million  respectively 
included in these amounts are deferred tax assets related to our uk subsidiary of approximately million as of december  and because of uncertainty as to future realization of these assets  a valuation allowance had been established prior to the third quarter of  and the valuation allowance on these uk based deferred tax assets will continue to be assessed separately 
see note of this form k for a further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
restructuring reserve for lease commitment cost 
we maintain a reserve for future rental costs under the terms of our lease for a portion of our primary minneapolis facility that has been permanently vacated 
as required by financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  this reserve has been reduced by estimated sub lease rentals of approximately  should actual sub lease rental and other amounts differ from our estimates  revisions to the restructuring reserve will be required 
at december   reserves for losses on lease commitments were approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities or certain approved corporate instruments with maturities of three years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of the portfolio of marketable securities of approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature on the last day of each quarter and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that date 
as a result  there were no unrealized gains or losses as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of approximately  from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements that offset the approximately  translation gain on the underlying inter company balance 
our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
the company minimizes such risk by limiting its counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
