item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes  included herein 
we design  manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing conditions  including obstructive sleep apnea 
our net revenues are generated from the sale and rental of our various flow generator devices  nasal mask systems  accessories and other products  and  to a lesser extent from royalties and sales of custom motors 
we have invested significant resources in research and development and product enhancement 
since  we have developed several innovations to the original cpap device to increase patient comfort and to improve ease of product use 
we have been developing products for automated treatment  titration and monitoring of osa  such as the autoset t and autoset spirit flow generators 
business acquisitions fiscal year ended june  on july  we acquired the assets of respro medical company limited respro  our hong kong distributor for total consideration of  in cash 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of respro have been included within our consolidated financial statements from july  an amount of  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of  has been recorded as goodwill 
fiscal year ended june  john stark and associates 
on july  we acquired the business of john stark and associates  our texas representative  for total consideration of  in cash 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of john stark and associates were included within our consolidated financial statements from july  an amount of  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of nil  has been recorded as goodwill 
fiscal year ended june  labhardt acquisition 
on november   we acquired all the common stock of labhardt ag  our swiss distributor  for total cash consideration  including acquisition costs  of million 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of labhardt ag have been included in our consolidated financial statements from november  an amount of million  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of million  has been recorded as goodwill 
smi acquisition 
on may   we acquired all of the common stock of servo magnetics incorporated smi through a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary  servo magnetics acquisition inc  for total consideration  including acquisition costs  of million 
consideration included the issue of  shares for fair value of million with the balance of the acquisition price paid in cash 
upon consummation of the merger  the surviving corporation  servo magnetics acquisition inc  changed its name to servo magnetics inc 
table of contents the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of smi have been included in our consolidated financial statements from may  an amount of million  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of million  has been recorded as goodwill 
purchased in process research and development of million was expensed upon acquisition of smi because technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed 
the value of in process technology was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto 
the discount rate used in the analysis was and was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets 
purchased research and development projects related to electrical motor systems used in our flow generator devices and other medical and data storage equipment 
key assumptions used in the analysis included gross margins of 
the majority of the new motor systems have been completed and have performed in line with expectations at the time of acquisition 
in process research and development charge on acquisition of map medizin technologie gmbh map in february  we recognized as an expense a charge of million with respect to five in process research and development programs under active development by map at date of acquisition 
the five projects were i a single walled nasal cushion mask system 
ii a new headgear system iii a standalone active humidifier iv an autotitration cpap device for treatment of osa v a new osa diagnostic screening device 
the status of each project as of june  is noted below i single walled nasal cushion the nasal cushion under development by map on acquisition was originally due for release in october delays in the design and manufacturing process delayed the release for seven months  until april the delay in release of the product was not significant over its expected life cycle  and has made no significant impact on the net return assumptions used in the initial in process research and development model 
since release  the product now referred to as the papillon has met or exceeded all sales forecasts 
ii new headgear the new headgear product line was withheld to coincide with the release of the papillon mask system in april and so was also seven months behind schedule in projected release dates 
since release  the new headgear system has exceeded original sales projections and continues to meet or exceed initial expectations 
iii standalone active humidifier due to other priorities and to the introduction of integrated humidification flow generator devices by a number of competitors during fiscal  we have abandoned the standalone humidifier project 

table of contents given the relatively small revenue forecast of the product line in the in process research and development model  the financial impact of this project is not material to resmed or the net return of the map acquisition 
iv auto titration cpap device the main product development effort of map since acquisition has been on the completion of the autotitration cpap flow generator specified in the initial in process research and development charge  now referred to as the magellan 
this project experienced some delays due to the complexity of the software algorithm development process and associated electronics resulting in the product being released in november sales are now broadly consistent with our initial expectations 
v osa diagnostic screening device map s new diagnostic screening device  now called the micromesam  was released in the german market in march we remain confident in the capacity of the device to enhance the diagnostic process  and remain confident in the potential of the product to significantly impact the treatment and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in the german market 
as at june   four of the five programs have been completed with the release of the papillon mask system  upgraded headgear  magellan flow generator and micromesam 
given the completion of the above research programs and performance of the associated product lines  we remain confident in the assumptions used to determine the in process research and development charge and  as a result  the net return of the map acquisition 
tax expense 
our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized 
to date  a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was in fiscal  and during fiscal  and  our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately and approximately 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and future effective tax rates will depend upon  numerous factors  including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a australian tax deduction is available  the level of non deductible expenses  and the use of available net operating loss carryforward deductions and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

working capital was million and million at june  and june  respectively 
inventories at june  increased by million or to million compared to june  inventories of million 
the percentage increase in inventories was less than the incremental increase in revenues in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the lower inventory growth reflects the impact of the relocation of manufacturing to our new facility at norwest in sydney in the fourth quarter of fiscal year which temporarily lowered production volumes and consequently inventory balances at june  accounts receivable at june  were million  an increase of million or over the june  accounts receivable balance of million 
this increase was modestly lower than the incremental increase in revenues for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  accounts receivable days outstanding increased to days for the quarter ended june   compared to days for the quarter ended june  the increase reflected  in part  sars related sales to china of million in the quarter ended june   which were collected prior to june  our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june  and was and  respectively

for the year ended june   million of the expenditure related to the 
table of contents construction of our new manufacturing facility 
capital expenditure was also incurred for the acquisition of computer hardware and software and the purchase of production tooling and equipment 
the capital expenditures in the year ended june  primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing facility  acquisition of computer hardware and software including a disaster recovery system  and purchase of production tooling equipment 
as a result of these capital expenditures  our balance sheet reflects net property  plant and equipment of approximately million at june  compared to million at june  during the year ended june   we did not repurchase any convertible subordinated notes

the total purchase price of the notes was million  including million in accrued interest 
we recognized a gain of million  net of tax of million  on these transactions 
at june   we had convertible subordinated notes outstanding of million 
we may from time to time seek to retire our convertible subordinated notes through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  and our current or future contractual obligations  if any  that may directly or indirectly apply to such transactions

the results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies 
changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations 
we are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts

critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  goodwill  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our long lived assets and goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model  which takes into consideration actual  historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment  at which time title transfers to the customer 
revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received 
royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned 
service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract 
revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract 
revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract 
freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue 
all freight related expenses are charged to cost of sales 
we do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities 
however  as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders  one time special pricing to support new product introductions  sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price breaks for regular order volumes 
the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products 
these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force 
we do not sell our products to these representatives  and do not recognize revenue on such shipments 
our products are predominantly therapy based equipment and require no installation 
as such  we have no significant installation obligations

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and business risks foreign currency market risk our functional currency is the us dollar  although the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies  and as such we transact business in various foreign currencies  including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar 
we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing expenditure 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in euro s and the australian dollar 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
we have determined our hedge program to be a non effective hedge as defined under sfas the foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities

we maintain a short term investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates during the twelve months ended june   would have resulted in approximately million change in pretax income

forward looking statements this report on form k contains or may contain certain forward looking statements and information that are based on our management s beliefs  as well as on estimates and assumptions made by  and information currently available to our management 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  plan  future and other similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements  including  in particular  statements regarding the development and approval of new products and product applications  market expansion  pending litigation and the development of new markets for our products  such as the cardiovascular and stroke markets 
these forward looking statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of the us private securities litigation reform act of you should not unduly rely on these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect the views of our management at the time the statements are made and are subject to a number of risks  uncertainties  estimates and assumptions  including  without limitation  and in addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements  those identified below and elsewhere in this report 
in addition  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include changes or developments in social  economic  market  legal or regulatory circumstances  changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due 
table of contents to changes in our industry or the economy generally  the emergence of new or growing competitors  the actions or omissions of third parties  including suppliers  customers  competitors and governmental authorities  and various other factors 
should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or the underlying estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary significantly from those expressed in such forward looking statements  and there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will in fact occur 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition or results of operations include the following our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business 
the markets for our sleep disordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to develop innovative new products and to be the first to market with those products 
the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  some of our competitors have greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in the markets for our products 
industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours 
this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing 
if we are unable to develop innovative new products  maintain competitive pricing  and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors  our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 
our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home health care products and sleep clinics 
we market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders 
we believe that home health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use 
the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 
we have limited resources to market to the more than  us sleep clinics and the more than  home health care dealer branch locations  most of which use  sell or recommend several brands of products 
in addition  home health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and third party reimbursement have declined for home care products  and home health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us 
we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products  or that home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 
we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleep disordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists 
we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness of our products 

table of contents any inability to effectively market our products outside the us could impact our profitability 
approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us  in approximately different countries 
many of these countries have unique regulatory  medical  and business environments 
if we are unable to effectively market our products outside the us  our overall financial performance could decline 
if we are unable to support our continued growth  our business could suffer 
we have experienced rapid and substantial growth 
as we continue to grow  the complexity of our operations increases  placing greater demands on our management 
our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business 
unexpected difficulties during expansion  the failure to attract and retain qualified employees  the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems  the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop 
if we fail to manage our growth  our business could suffer 
if we fail to integrate our acquisitions with our operations  our business could suffer 
the integration of our acquired operations requires significant efforts from our company and the acquired entity  for several years after each acquisition 
although we acquired our map subsidiary in february  our labhardt subsidiary in november  and our servo magnetics subsidiary in may  we continue to adjust our business strategies  equipment  and personnel to achieve maximum efficiencies and success 
if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of our acquired entities  we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in non us markets  subjecting us to various risks relating to international activities that could adversely affect our overall profitability 
sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately   and of our net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe  australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs and other trade barriers  compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations  reduction in third party payer reimbursement for our products  inability to obtain import licenses  changes in trade policies and in us and foreign tax policies  possible changes in export or import restrictions  and the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings 
since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars  our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

table of contents government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our products  which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products 
our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
therefore  even if a product is approved for marketing  we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product  that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or  that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate  will not subsequently be reduced 
for example  in some markets  such as spain  france and germany  government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations 
in other markets  such as australia and the united kingdom  there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep disordered breathing conditions 
additionally  future legislation or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement  particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers reimbursement rights  may harm our business 
as we continue to develop new products  those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement  if at all  until they are approved for marketing 
in the united states  we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics 
we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products 
however  we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs  particularly medicaid and medicare 
in particular  the federal anti kickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  to induce either the referral of an individual  or the furnishing  recommending or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs 
the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 
many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback law 
we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer 
these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private third party payers 
these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage  coding  and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers 
any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties  including fines 
in addition to reimbursement for our products  our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products 
during fiscal year  the us government proposed reductions in reimbursement rates for some of these other products 
such proposed reductions  if they occur  may have a material impact on our customers 
any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers  or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 
complying with food and drug administration and other regulations is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and international regulations regarding our business activities 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in  among other things  recalls of our products  substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees 
a recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs  damage our reputation  and materially affect operating results 

table of contents product sales  introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda or similar foreign regulations  which could cause our sales and profits to decline 
before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states  we must obtain fda clearance  which can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the k clearance process 
we have modified some of our k approved products without submitting new k notices  which we do not believe were required 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new k notifications for modifications to our existing products  we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k notification 
any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier  more rigorous fda examination process 
for example  in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product prior to submitting a k notice 
additionally  we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products 
the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance 
marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals  and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals  our sales could suffer 
we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 
off label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties 
clearance under section k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda 
we may request additional label indications for our current products  and the fda may deny those requests outright  require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance 
if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for off label use  we could be subject to fines  injunctions or other penalties 
disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability 
we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers  including some who are single source suppliers for us 
we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or  in the alternative  that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 
a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components  or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part  would limit our ability to manufacture our devices  which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability 
we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 
our intellectual property may not protect our products  and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products  their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have a number of pending patent applications  and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications 
we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable 
legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving  and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims 
additionally  there may be third party patents  
table of contents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 
we face the risks that third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights  our non disclosure agreements will be breached  we will not have adequate remedies for infringement  our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors  or third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect our proprietary rights  or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of patent claims  including these pending claims  as well as participation in other inter party proceedings  can be expensive and time consuming  even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us 
if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse  we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties  could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products 
additionally  the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country  and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved  or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 
we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage  which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims 
we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits 
our insurance policies have various exclusions  and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case  we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance 
insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  may require us to pay substantial amounts  which could harm our business 
we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions 
from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and were subject to tax audits in france  the us and germany during the year ended june  the tax audits in france and the us were concluded in the year ended june  with no material adjustments 
the german tax audit remains ongoing 
any assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income  tax payable or deferred tax assets  and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons 
our operating results have  from time to time  fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations may result from a number of factors  including the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the geographic mix of product sales  
table of contents the success of our marketing efforts in new regions  changes in third party reimbursement  timing of regulatory clearances and approvals  timing of orders by distributors  expenditures incurred for research and development  competitive pricing in different regions  seasonality  the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs  the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses  and other activities of our competitors 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline 
our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
the facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers 
although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
delaware law  provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could make it difficult for another company to acquire us 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders 
in particular  our board of directors is divided into three classes  serving for staggered three year terms 
because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 
additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders 
under our stockholder rights plan  we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our series a junior participating preferred stock at a discount  under certain circumstances 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors 
a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
additionally  two of our seven directors and two of our five executive officers reside outside the united states  along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets  those persons or their assets 
in addition  we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts
