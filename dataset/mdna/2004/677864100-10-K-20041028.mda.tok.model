revenue recognition

upon shipment an invoice is generated that sets the fixed and determinable price 
sales returns and allowances  which have historically not been material  are reviewed to determine if any additional reserve is necessary 
sales returns and allowances are not material due to the nature of the company s business 
allowance for doubtful accounts are evaluated by the company utilizing a combination of a historical percentage of sales by division and specific customer account analysis 
the company maintains and monitors a list of customers whose creditworthiness has diminished 
this list is used as part of the specific customer account analysis 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market

finally based on the survey data  maps and professional judgment of the mining engineers estimates are developed 
during the normal course of the company s overburden removal activities the company performs on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill the older site 
this process allows the company to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability for the reclamation function

forward looking statements are also subject to the risk of changes in market conditions in the overall economy  energy prices  the risk of war or international instability and  for the fluids purification and agricultural markets  changes in planting activity  crop quality and overall agricultural demand  including export demand  increasing regulation of the food chain and foreign exchange rate fluctuations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk and employs policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company had two interest rate swap agreements as of july  the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material 
the company is exposed to currency risk as it relates to certain accounts receivables and the company s foreign operations 
the company has always determined that the currency risk is immaterial to the overall presentation of the financial statements 
however  the company began a program in fiscal of hedging certain receivable balances in a further attempt to minimize the risk 
the company is exposed to regulatory risk in the fluid purification and agricultural markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
the company actively monitors developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which it is a member 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk with respect to natural gas 
the company has contracted for a portion of its fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
these contracts will reduce the volatility in fuel prices  and the weighted average cost of these contracts has been estimated to be approximately higher than the contracts for fiscal these contracts were entered into during the normal course of business and no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about the company s natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of the company s natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  and the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed the company to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued and in some cases expanded use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on the company s fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market
