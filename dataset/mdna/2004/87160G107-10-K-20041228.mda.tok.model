s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors including but not limited to those under the headings special note regarding forward looking statements and factors that might affect future results in item of this report 
overview valley forge is a medical device company that develops  manufactures and sells medical devices for use in surgery and other healthcare applications 
our core business involves the sale of bipolar electrosurgical generators and other bipolar generators  based on our dualwave tm technology  and complementary instrumentation and disposable products 
our current line of bipolar electrosurgical products are used in neurosurgery and spine surgery and in dental applications 
we also recently commenced selling a lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain 
in fiscal and beyond  we plan to expand the market for our products with our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generator and new proprietary single use hand switching bipolar instruments  new products based on our proprietary lesion generator technology  and other products and product refinements 
our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical system  which is expected to be introduced in the market in fiscal  is designed to replace other surgical tools  such as monopolar electrosurgical systems  lasers and ultrasonic aspirators 
we believe our dualwave tm technology distinguishes our products from our competitors 
with appropriate technique  our bipolar electrosurgical systems based on our dualwave tm technology allow a surgeon or dentist to cut tissue in a manner that minimizes collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue and to coagulate blood vessels quickly  safely and efficiently 
by substantially reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissue  the surgeon or dentist can work safely in close proximity with nerves  blood vessels and bone 
our bipolar electrosurgical systems can also be used in close proximity with metal implants and irrigated fields 
for over years  we have had worldwide exclusive distribution agreements with codman shurtleff  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc  codman to market our neurosurgery bipolar electrosurgical systems and other products 
during fiscal year  we extended the term of a distribution agreement  which we originally entered into with codman on december   until september  on october   we entered into a new agreement with codman defining our business relationship from october  through december  under the agreement  codman continues to be the exclusive worldwide distributor of our existing products in the fields of neuorcranial and neurospinal surgery through march  and the nonexclusive distributor in those fields until december   as those terms may be extened by mutual agreement of the parties 
under the agreement  codman is also given a limited right of first refusal until march  regarding the marketing of our new multifunctional electrosurgical generator and single use hand switching bipolar instruments in the fields of neurospinal and neurocranial surgery 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our sales from sales to codman 
for the fiscal year  of our revenue was derived from sales to codman 
our goal is to be the global leader in the development of bipolar medical devices and other products in specialty surgical and healthcare fields and then expand the use of our bipolar electrosurgical products into general surgery 
the key elements of our strategy include o expanding the use of our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical system into other surgical markets  such as spine maxillofacial  ent  orthopedic and general surgeries 
o increasing revenues in the neurosurgery field with our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical system 
o expanding our product lines with new products  including a new lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain and other applications of our bipolar lesion technology 
results of operations summary sales of  for fiscal were greater than sales of  for fiscal and less than sales of  for fiscal operating income was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal net income for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal sales total sales and gross margin on sales total sales    cost of sales    gross profit on sales    gross profit as a percentage of sales the increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects an increase in sales of our bident r bipolar tissue management system for dental applications and new sales to stryker corporation of a lesion generator we developed for the percutaneous treatment of pain  which was partially offset by a decrease in sales to codman shurtleff  inc the decrease in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a decrease in sales to codman 
sales of our neurosurgical products to codman shurtleff  inc decreased to  in fiscal as compared to sales of  in fiscal and sales of  in fiscal the decreased sales reflect a decrease in sales volume of neurosurgical products 
included in sales to codman for fiscal is a one time payment of  in the second quarter of fiscal that codman made to satisfy its minimum purchase obligation under the first three month extension of the term of the then existing distribution agreement 
during fiscal  we extended a distribution agreement with codman on a quarterly basis until september  on october   we entered into a new agreement with codman which defines our business relationship from october  to december  under the new agreement  codman continues to be the exclusive worldwide distributor of our existing products in the fields of neurocranial and neurospinal surgery through march   and the nonexclusive distributor in those fields until december   as those terms may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties 
for the period from october  to march   codman has agreed to make minimum purchases of million per calendar quarter 
for fiscal  sales of the bident r bipolar tissue management system for dental applications were  or of sales as compared to approximately  or of sales  for fiscal and approximately  or of our sales  for fiscal sales of the bident r tissue management system of  in the fourth quarter of decreased as compared to the sales in the third quarter of fiscal as we directed more of our resources towards the completion of a new lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain and our distribution arrangement with stryker corporation for that product 
for fiscal  we are considering product modifications and other strategies for our dental products 
during fiscal  we had sales to stryker of  which includes sales of demonstration units of a lesion generator for percutaneous treatment of pain 
on october   we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with stryker corporation for that generator 
the supply and distribution agreement is for a term commencing on november  and ending on december   under which stryker has agreed to make minimum purchases of approximately  in the first agreement year for a combination of sales demonstration units and commercial sale units and minimum purchases of approximately  per year for commercial sale units in the each of the second and third agreement years 
minimum purchase requirements for agreement years four and five are to be determined by the parties based on market conditions and other factors 
the agreement also provides stryker certain rights for other new product concepts developed by valley forge in both pain control and expanded market areas 
sales by medical field the table below sets forth our sales by medical field of generators  irrigators and other products and disposable products for fiscal  and sales of generators  irrigators and other products in other fields represent sales to stryker corporation and sales of disposable products in other fields represent sales to boston scientific corporation and direct sales to hospitals 
generators  irrigators and other products neurosurgery field    dental field    other fields  total of all fields    disposable products neurosurgery field    dental field   other fields    total of all fields    in fiscal  of our sales related to sales of bipolar electrosurgical generators  irrigators and accessories as compared to approximately and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively 
sales of disposable products accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal as compared to approximately of our sales in fiscal and approximately of our sales in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal was of sales  compared with of sales  for fiscal during fiscal  cost of sales was of sales 
gross margin was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to increased sales volume 
we cannot be sure that gross margins will remain at current levels or show improvement in the future due to the distribution channels used  product mix  and fluctuation in manufacturing production levels and overhead costs as new products are introduced 
in addition  inefficiencies in manufacturing new products and the distribution channels utilized to sell those products may adversely impact gross margin 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  or of sales  in fiscal  from  or of sales  in fiscal  and from  or of sales  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses reflect increased selling and marketing expenses incurred in connection with implementing the sales and marketing plan  which we commenced in fiscal  for the bident r bipolar tissue management system and increased transactional legal fees incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development expenses were  or of sales  in fiscal   or of sales  in fiscal  and  or of sales  in fiscal we will continue to invest in research and development to expand our technological base for use in both existing and additional clinical areas 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal was primarily related to the continued development of our new multifunction bipolar electrosurgical generator and instrumentation and the completion of the lesion generator for use in the percutaneous treatment of pain for which we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with stryker corporation on october  other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  increased for fiscal to  from  for fiscal and decreased from  for fiscal due primarily to interest income 
at the end of fiscal  we had  in cash and cash equivalents as compared to  at the end of fiscal and  at the end of fiscal income tax provision the provision for income taxes was  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was approximately as compared to approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal net income net income increased slightly to  for fiscal  as compared to net income of  for fiscal net income was  for fiscal basic and diluted income per share was for fiscal as compared to basic and diluted income per share of for fiscal and for fiscal liquidity and capital resources at september   we had  in working capital compared to  at the end of fiscal and  at the end of fiscal the primary measures of our liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventory balances  as well as our borrowing ability 
the cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal as compared to  used in fiscal the cash provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to operating profits net of adjustments for non cash items  a decrease in prepaid items and other current assets of  and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes payable of  offset by increases of  in accounts receivable   in inventory and  in deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  accounts receivable net of allowances increased by  to a total of  at the end of fiscal the increase in accounts receivable was principally due to the timing of shipments and increased sales during fiscal in fiscal  inventories increased by  to a total of  at the end of fiscal compared to  at the end of fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased inventory to meet anticipated sales of the lesion generator for the percutaneous treatment of pain 
inventories were kept at these levels primarily to support anticipated future sales activity 
in fiscal  we used  for the purchase of equipment and building improvements in connection with our manufacturing operations 
net property and equipment decreased to  at the end of fiscal as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal in august  our board of directors terminated our then existing stock repurchase plan and authorized a new repurchase plan to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
we did not purchase any of our stock in fiscal pursuant to this plan 
in fiscal  we used  to repurchase  shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase plan 
all the shares of common stock repurchased were retired 
to date  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock under the plan  leaving a balance of  that is available for repurchase under the plan 
on october   we entered into an option agreement to purchase the malis r trademark from leonard i 
malis 
under the option agreement  we are granted an option to acquire the malis r trademark at any time over a period of five years 
we paid dr 
leonard i 
malis  for the option and are required to pay an annual fee before each anniversary of the option agreement of  for each of the first two anniversaries and increasing to  before the fourth anniversary in order to continue the option in effect from year to year 
in the event that we decide to exercise the option  we will pay dr 
leonard i 
malis  which includes interest  in twenty six equal quarterly installments of  and which will be evidenced by a promissory note secured with a security interest in the trademark and certain of our patents 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we plan to finance our operating and capital needs principally with cash flows from operations and existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations in the near future 
however  should it be necessary  we believe we could borrow adequate funds at competitive rates and terms 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the funds we expend in marketing  selling and distributing our products  the success in commercializing our existing products  development and commercialization of products in other clinical markets  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
we have a line of credit of  with wachovia bank  na which calls for interest to be charged at the bank s national commercial rate 
the credit accommodation is unsecured and requires us to have a tangible net worth of no less than  our current tangible net worth exceeds  at september  as of september   there was no outstanding balance on this line 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory allowances  warranty costs  contingencies and other special charges  and taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and warranty costs we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  we may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and the related provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future changes to the sales returns and allowances provision 
our warranty obligation is affected primarily by product that does not meet specifications within the applicable warranty period and any related costs to repair or replace such products 
should our actual experience of warranty claims differ from our estimates of such obligations  our provision for warranty costs could change 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  determined by the moving average method  or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that we determine there are excess quantities based on our projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
amortization periods we record amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
we base the determination of these useful lives on the period over which we expect the related assets to contribute to our cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if our assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  we may change future amortization expense 
deferred tax assets and liabilities our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
loss contingencies we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by employees or former employees  with respect to our products and involving commercial disputes 
our financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which we are currently a party because we currently believe that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  and are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if we change our assessment of the likely outcome of these matters goodwill impairment we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests to determine if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may have been impaired 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
impairment is measured by the difference between the recorded value of goodwill and its implied fair value when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting 
under this method  employee stock based compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of the company s stock and the exercise price of the award 
we account for stock options issued to non employees using the fair value method of accounting  which requires us to assign a value to the stock options issued based on an option pricing model  and to record that value as compensation expense 
we use the black scholes option pricing model 
if we were to account for stock options issued to employees using the fair value method of accounting rather than the intrinsic value method  our results of operations would be significantly affected
