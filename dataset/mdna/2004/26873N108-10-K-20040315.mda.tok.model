item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and market products that are important in many kinds of wireless communications 
we focus on the needs of the mobile information user  with an increasing emphasis on broadband applications for high data rate  high capacity wireless communications 
following is a summary of significant factors affecting the company in for continuing operations sales grew overall from the previous year  with our lxe and satcom divisions setting new sales records 
lxe benefited from favorable european market conditions and currency exchange rates 
satcom took advantage of new opportunities for its products in us defense applications 
our space technology and ems wireless divisions remained profitable  although sales did not grow substantially 
our only unprofitable performer was the start up satnet division 
for discontinued operations we announced a formal plan to dispose of our space technology montreal division  and we sold our healthcare product line 
we accounted for these divisions as discontinued operations 
the results reflected approximately million pre tax of losses from additional costs and reserve provisions for legacy commercial space programs  additional costs of downsizing the montreal operation 
of 
table of contents we also recorded a million pre tax loss to write down the assets held for sale to their estimated fair value  and a million loss related to the sale of our healthcare product line 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
we consider that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial statements  because these policies require significant judgment  and as a result  actual future financial results may be different from expectations 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenue recognition for fixed price  long term contracts in the space technology atlanta and satcom segments  as well as the space technology montreal operations currently held for sale  is a critical accounting policy involving significant management estimates 
these segments long term contracts use the ratio of cost incurred to total estimated cost as the measure of performance that determines how much revenue should be recognized percentage completion accounting 
the determination of total estimated cost relies on engineering estimates of the cost to complete the contract  with allowances for identifiable risks and uncertainties 
these engineering estimates are frequently reviewed and updated 
however  unforeseen problems can occur to substantially reduce the rate of future revenue recognition in relation to costs incurred 
as of december  the company had recognized a cumulative total of million in revenues under percentage completion accounting  but which revenues were unbilled as of that date due to the billing milestones specified in the respective customer contracts 
during  two large contracts in discontinued operations that were accounted for under percentage completion accounting experienced technical and supplier difficulties  resulting in increases to the estimated cost at completion totaling over million 
the company has provided reserves for identified risks that could cause cost increases in the future 
these contracts are technically challenging  and there is a risk that further unforeseen difficulties could cause increases to the cost at completion that exceed the company s provisions  resulting in further losses associated with these contracts 
accounting for government research incentives our accrual of research incentives from the canadian government is a critical accounting policy involving management estimates for our montreal based operations 
these incentives are in the form of a cash reimbursement for a portion of certain qualified research expenditures 
incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales  because the underlying research efforts primarily apply to development of technological capabilities for specific business opportunities 
for the year ended december   total incentives earned were approximately million  compared with million for the year ended december  we have established procedures to identify qualified costs and to submit appropriate claims for reimbursement  all of these claims are subject to financial and scientific audits by the canadian government concerning whether certain expenses qualified for incentive programs 
although there have historically been no significant disallowances of previously accrued incentives that resulted from these audits  such disallowances in the future would have an unfavorable effect on our statement of operations 
evaluation of long lived assets for impairment all long lived assets on the balance sheet are periodically reviewed for impairment 
to test recoverability  we estimate the cash flows expected to result from the long lived assets under several different scenarios  including the potential sale of assets  as well as continuing to hold the assets under several different kinds of business conditions 
no long lived assets classified as held and used were determined to be impaired as of december  of 
table of contents in the third quarter of  the assets related to the space technology montreal division and the healthcare product line were reclassified from assets held and used to assets held for sale 
as a result  these business components were accounted for as discontinued operations  and the net assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair values upon disposal 
in november  the sale of the healthcare product line was completed 
the loss on the sale of the healthcare product line was approximately million  and the fair value write down for the assets associated with the space technology montreal division was million  with an approximately million us income tax benefit related to these losses 
the fair value of the space technology montreal division upon disposal was estimated in canadian dollars using an expected present value technique and a discount rate of 
the resulting fair value was converted to us dollars using the december  foreign currency rate 
a change in the discount rate would cause a change in the valuation of approximately million 
our less than equity investment in a limited partnership  skybridge llp was included in the assets reclassified to assets held for sale 
the objective of this investment  which was initially acquired in connection with the company s acquisition of the space technology montreal operations in  is to enable the space technology montreal division to participate as a hardware provider in the development and implementation by skybridge of a satellite network to provide high data rate wireless services 
establishment of reserves for deferred income tax assets it is management s current expectation that our canadian operations will earn more than enough research related tax benefits each year to offset any future canadian federal tax liability for any given year 
as a result  we have reserved substantially all the net deferred tax assets associated with these research related tax benefits totaling approximately million at december   because they are unlikely to be realized 
however  this reserve may be reduced resulting in an income tax benefit to a future statement of operations if our profitability in canada increases  which would increase the tax liability incurred in future years  or the level of our qualified research in canada decreases  which would lower the tax benefits earned in future years 
results of operations most revenues were derived from commercial and international markets in  in and in  as compared with sales for us government end use 
more revenues were derived from sales to systems integrators  third party manufacturers and distributors than from sales directly to end users 
net sales consolidated net sales increased to million in  compared with million in and million in for compared with  the most significant growth occurred in the lxe and satcom segments 
for lxe  the increase in sales was due to favorable european market conditions and currency exchange rates  as well as the introduction of new products and a new partner and service plans 
for the satcom segment  the increase in sales was mainly due to higher unit sales of aeronautical and land mobile terminals for new us defense applications 
of 
table of contents for compared with  the most significant growth was in the company s satcom segment  which benefited from the continued success of its aeronautical communications products including a new high speed terminal introduced during the year  as well as new contracts for its emergency management products 
the net revenue growth in for the space technology segment reflected much higher revenues recognized under new long term defense contracts and lower revenues recognized from older commercial space contracts which was expected  following the preceding year s strong revenues and declining order rate in commercial space 
net sales and operating income by segment our segment net sales and operating income loss were as follows in thousands years ended december net sales space technology less sales to discontinued operations space technology external sales lxe ems wireless satcom satnet other total operating income loss space technology contract reserve adjustment subtotal lxe ems wireless satcom satnet other total space technology orders for long term defense contracts increased substantially in   and with the result that defense related revenues and profits grew over this period 
however  overall segment sales decreased from to due to lower non defense orders 
lxe net sales for the lxe segment increased from to and again in due to the introduction of new rugged computers for logistics and new partner and service programs as well as favorable european market conditions and currency exchange rates 
revenues from north and south america also increased in compared with of 
table of contents ems wireless the results compared favorably with despite uncertainty in the telecommunications market  management believes this improvement was due to the introduction of new products  improved order delivery times  and the segment establishing itself as an approved vendor to all major wireless carriers in the us net sales continued to increase in due to greater unit sales of repeater products 
antenna sales were down for the full year in compared with due to a lower level of rollout activity by our customers  however  the company has increased antenna sales in the latter part of through the introduction of new products and through our approved vendor status for major wireless carriers 
satcom most of satcom s sales over the three years ended december  have been for installation on corporate jets and on military command aircraft 
management believes that satcom is the leading supplier of advanced aeronautical communications products in the corporate jet market 
in  satcom s profits were reduced by additional costs to develop new products  including a high speed data aeronautical terminal and enhanced land mobile terminals 
the rollout of these new products in helped increase sales and profits compared with the results also benefited from new contracts for emergency management products in particular  satellite based search and rescue systems 
the increase in sales in was due to the continued growth of unit sales of high speed data aeronautical terminals and land mobile portable terminals 
sales of aeronautical terminals  especially in the earlier part of  benefited from demand for enhanced mobile communications capabilities for senior us military commanders 
we expect that our corporate jet revenues will significantly slow in  but satcom s overall revenues should continue to grow based on defense and security opportunities for our emergency management and land mobile products 
satnet this segment is our start up venture providing dvb rcs standard hubs and terminals for broadband communications via satellite 
sales increased from to due to the introduction of enhanced hub and terminal products 
satnet sales decreased in compared with primarily due to lower unit sales of terminals 
however  there was an increase in sales of hubs in  and we believe that there is considerable potential for future terminal sales as our customers use their hubs to roll out broadband services to new markets 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  was in  in and in in  improved margins on newer satnet products helped offset the effect of a stronger canadian dollar on the costs associated with the canada based satcom segment 
the cost of sales percentage decreased in compared with  because of a more favorable mix of contracts in the space technology division 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  remained relatively stable at in  in and in the dollar value increases in sg a for each of the past three years have related mainly to greater selling and marketing expenses to support the recent sales growth  especially in satcom  lxe and satnet 
of 
table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses r d represent the cost of our internally funded efforts 
significant r d efforts also occur under specific customer orders in the space technology segment and  accordingly  are reflected in cost of sales 
the decrease in compared to was due to reductions in internally funded r d as development was completed on high speed aeronautical terminals for satcom and on certain repeater products for ems wireless 
the overall level of r d effort was materially unchanged in compared with contract reserve adjustment in december  we accrued a million contract reserve  which represented an estimate of the loss to be incurred in settlement of a space technology contract 
we had worked to develop the crucial antenna technology for systems that provide multi channel  live television to commercial airline flights 
however  the rollout by our customer a television system joint venture was proceeding much slower than expected  as the airline industry faced difficult economic conditions 
as a result of the considerable uncertainties at the end of about the timing of the airline industry s recovery and adoption of our technology  we concluded that sales under the contract were unlikely to develop at the previously expected rate 
we decided to seek a settlement of the contract with our customer  including possible use of the contract s provisions for dispute resolution  and accrued the reserve 
in  while settlement negotiations were still in an early stage  the television system joint venture was acquired by a new airline that had been the joint venture s largest customer 
subsequently  we reached a new  long term agreement to supply the airline with advanced antennas 
based on the terms of this agreement and the strong financial position and creditworthiness of the new airline  we concluded that we no longer needed the million reserve 
the elimination of this reserve resulted in a benefit to the statement of operations in the fourth quarter of non operating income the non operating gains in and resulted from sales of capital assets 
foreign exchange gain loss we recognize foreign exchange gains and losses related to an asset or liability denominated in a foreign currency and  if applicable  any embedded derivatives 
we use foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our canadian operations contracts are in us dollars  and foreign exchange gains result from a stronger us dollar against the canadian dollar 
our canadian operations also do a significant amount of business in the united kingdom  and foreign exchange gains result from a stronger canadian dollar against the british pound 
we also recognize net gains and losses from translation of the lxe european subsidiaries short term intercompany liabilities  payable in us dollars 
these liabilities arise when the subsidiaries buy hardware from the parent for resale in europe 
a weaker us dollar against the euro usually results in foreign exchange gains 
of 
table of contents the company enters into forward currency contracts to reduce the level of gains and losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
net of the effect of these forward contracts  the company reported a net foreign currency loss in of  which was mainly the result of a weaker us dollar against the canadian dollar 
in  the net foreign currency gain of  resulted primarily from a period during the year when the us dollar strengthened against the canadian dollar 
foreign currency losses of  in were the result of various changes in the us dollar against both the canadian dollar and the euro 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in and from was due to decreased debt levels that resulted from positive cash flow and lower interest rates 
income tax expense benefit the main factor affecting our consolidated effective income tax rate each year is the relative proportion of taxable income that we earn in canada  where we have a much lower effective rate than in the us or other locations due to tax benefits for research related expenditures 
in and in  we earned most of our taxable income in the us and other locations  and the consolidated effective income tax rate was 
in  we recognized a consolidated net tax benefit despite reporting consolidated taxable income because we incurred a loss in for our combined operations in the us  where we have a higher effective tax rate  and we earned substantial taxable income in canada  where we have a lower effective rate 
therefore  the net tax benefit on the loss in the us exceeded the net tax expense on earnings in canada  resulting in a consolidated net tax benefit in in  we expect the effective income tax rate to be similar to the rate reported in change in accounting principle in  we recorded an after tax loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  related to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
sfas no 
also establishes new accounting rules for hedging instruments which  depending on the nature of the hedge  require that changes in the fair value of derivatives must be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a hedging instrument s change in fair value must be immediately recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedging instruments  any change in the value is recognized in current earnings 
upon the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a net liability for all derivatives totaling  of which   after income taxes was charged to the statement of operations as a transition adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
the remaining net liability for all derivatives was charged to the unbilled revenue component of accounts receivable  and to the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources during  net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million  compared with million in and million in the company purchased million in fixed assets during the company received  from the sale of its healthcare operations and  from the sale of other investments

the facility has no specific maturity date  but is reviewed annually 
the company has agreed to apply the proceeds from the potential sale of its space technology montreal division to revolving debt under this agreement 
subsequent to december   the company further amended its canadian credit agreement  including pricing  as a condition of obtaining a covenant waiver  at current borrowing levels  the annual cost of this facility would increase by approximately  furthermore  upon determination of whether or not a sale of the space technology montreal division will occur  the company expects to enter into negotiations to refinance or restructure its existing us and canadian credit agreements 
the company expects that capital expenditures in will range from million to million 
these expenditures will be used primarily to purchase equipment that increases or enhances capacity and productivity 
the cash flow from continuing operations during improved the company s cash position and management believes that cash provided from operations and borrowings available under its credit agreements will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the operating and capital expenditure needs for existing operations during the next months 
to fund long term growth  the company may consider such measures as public or private offerings of common stock or convertible securities
