investments investment management is an integral part of our business 
investments are maintained to ensure that asset types and maturities are appropriate for the company s policy reserves and other liabilities so that we can meet our obligations to policyholders under a wide variety of economic conditions 
a substantial portion of our insurance subsidiaries policy liabilities result from long term disability reserves that have proven to be very stable over time  and annuity products on which interest rates can be adjusted periodically  subject to minimum interest rate guarantees 
policyholders or claimants may not withdraw funds from the large block of disability reserves 
instead  claim payments are issued monthly over periods that may extend for many years 
holding these stable long term reserves makes it possible to allocate a significant portion of invested assets to long term fixed rate investments  including commercial mortgage loans 
the ability to allocate a significant portion of investments to commercial mortgage loans  combined with stancorp mortgage investors unique expertise with respect to its market niche for small  fixed rate commercial mortgage loans  provides the ability to increase the yield obtained on the overall investment portfolio
