item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a diversified television broadcasting company that owns and operates  provides programming services pursuant to lmas or provides sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to more television stations than all but one other commercial broadcasting group in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming services pursuant to lmas or provide sales services to television stations in markets 
we currently have duopolies  where we own and operate two stations  in ten markets  own and operate a station and provide programming and operating services to a second station in nine markets  and own a station and provide or are provided sales  operational and managerial services to a second station in four markets 
our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers and television network compensation 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of gross broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  from a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and from a competitive increase in the number of media outlets providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of increasing national media outlets include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers 
our primary operating expenses are syndicated program rights fees  commissions on revenues  employee salaries and newsgathering and station promotional costs 
amortization and depreciation of costs other than goodwill associated with the acquisition of the stations and interest carrying charges are significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
sinclair television group  inc stg is a wholly owned subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group  inc that we created in as part of our redemption of our hytops  on september   we completed the creation of a modified holding company structure  whereby we transferred substantially all of our television broadcast assets and liabilities to stg 
as such  stg has become the primary obligor under our existing bank credit agreement  the senior subordinated notes due and the senior subordinated notes due our class a common stock  class b common stock  series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock and the convertible senior subordinated notes remain at sinclair broadcast group  inc and are not obligations or securities of stg 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  program contract costs  property and equipment  intangible assets  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make their payments  additional allowances may be required 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to television programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
the rights to program materials are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated net realizable values are based upon management s expectation of future advertising revenues net of sales commissions to be generated by the remaining program material 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using either a four year accelerated method or based on usage  whichever yields the greater amortization for each program 
program contract costs  estimated by management to be amortized in the succeeding year  are classified as current assets 
payments of program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not affected by adjustments for amortization or estimated net realizable value 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional writedowns to net realizable value may be required 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operational performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas no 
 which requires such assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
we test our broadcast licenses by estimating the fair market value of each fcc license using a discounted cash flow model 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value to determine if an impairment exists 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within the designated marketing area of each broadcast license as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets relating to various state net operating loss nol carryforwards based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that they will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  if there is a material change in our projected future taxable income or if there is a change in our ability to utilize the state nol carryforwards due to changes in state laws  we will make any necessary adjustments to the valuation allowance 
this may result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary 
the resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by us 
set forth below are the principal types of broadcast revenues received by our stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues broadcast revenue dollars in thousands years ended december  local regional advertising national advertising network compensation political advertising production broadcast revenues less agency commissions broadcast revenues  net barter revenues other revenues total revenues our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were syndicated programming  network programming  news  direct advertising programming  sports programming  children s programming and other programming 
similarly  our five largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were automotive  professional services  fast food  paid programming including religious programming and retail department stores 
no other advertising category accounted for more than of our broadcast revenues in no individual advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the years ended december   and for definitions of items  see footnotes to table in item selected financial data

excluding the effect of political advertising revenue  we continued to see an increase in local advertising spending primarily due to our direct mail initiatives and growth in our largest categories of automotive and services 
national sales declined due to lower advertising spending primarily by soft drink  fast food and movie advertisers 
due to the biennial cycle for political races and elections  we expect to benefit in from additional political revenues due to the presidential and other federal  state and local elections  as well as benefit from additional revenues from our direct mail initiatives 
our results also include increased expenses reflecting continued expansion of our news central operations  our direct mail sales effort and our continued expenditures related to our conversion to digital television 
using our news central model we continued to implement local news programming  which brought our total news franchise to stations in markets with of those stations in markets operating under news central 
our focus for will primarily be on adding additional news dayparts and converting certain existing news stations to the more cost effective news central model 
we continue to target direct mail advertisers and introduce the direct mail advertisers to television as a medium to reach their customers 
we are expanding our direct mail initiatives with plans to add more mailings during we expect capital expenditures for the year of approximately million  as described later in this section under the heading  liquidity and capital resources 
years ended december  and net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or a loss of per common share for the year ended december  the primary reason for the reduction in the net loss was the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment charge of million  related to our broadcast licenses and goodwill  which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations  net of related tax benefit of million during the first quarter of we also recorded an unrealized gain on derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  compared to an unrealized loss on derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  these were non cash charges which had no effect on our liquidity or capital resources currently or prospectively 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  note  goodwill and other intangible assets and note  derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
net broadcast revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or 
during the year ended december   we had decreased revenue due to cyclical or non recurring events as follows million related to the war in iraq  million related to political advertising  million related to the super bowl and million related to the olympics 
the decline in super bowl revenue occurred because the super bowl aired on our eight abc stations during versus our twenty fox stations during the super bowl aired on our three cbs stations in and will air on our twenty fox stations in and on our eight abc stations in the decreased revenue due to cyclical or non recurring events was greatly offset by increased revenue of million related to our direct mail initiative 
from a revenue category standpoint  the year ended december  was positively impacted by higher advertising revenue generated from the automotive  professional service  school  paid programming  restaurant and home product sectors  offset by decreases in political  soft drink  fast food  movie  telecommunication and retail sectors

local revenues  excluding political revenues  increased million to million or  during the year ended december  from million for the same period last year 
excluding political revenues  national revenues declined due to lower advertising spending primarily in the soft drink  fast food  telecommunications  and movie sectors 
the increase in local revenues is related to our continued focus on local sales and our direct mail conversion initiative that  as noted above  generated increased revenues of million during the year ended december   as compared to the same period last year 
from a network affiliate perspective  broadcast revenue from time sales at our fox affiliates  which represents of the total  decreased million to million  or during the year ended december  from million for the same period last year

other operating divisions expenses increased by million  of which million resulted from the consolidation of acrodyne  offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs of million for g  primarily related to the consolidation from three offices to one office and continued focus on cost reduction  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  station production expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in station production costs primarily related to an increase in promotion costs of million during the february ratings sweeps compared to february  when we reduced our spending due to direct competition from the olympics  offset by decreased promotional spending in the second and third quarter of million in six of our markets 
we also experienced increases in spending of million for the news central expansions in our tampa  flint  milwaukee  birmingham  las vegas  cincinnati  and greensboro markets  nielsen rating service fees of million related to new contracts for eleven stations  million in affiliate fees  engineering costs of million related to news expansions in the fourth quarter  the full year effect of the addition of our wnab tv outsourcing agreement during the second quarter of  and increased electricity costs related to digital tv of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in programming and production costs of million related to our outsourcing and lma agreements  a decrease in music license fees of million  and other miscellaneous decreases of million

depreciation and amortization decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  was related to a decrease in amortization of million related to our program contract costs and nrv adjustments as a result of a lower cost of additions of new programming during as compared to and a decrease in nrv adjustments  offset by an increase in fixed asset depreciation of million related to our property additions  primarily resulting from our digital television conversion and centralized news investments 
we expect amortization related to our program contract costs will decrease from but it will be a smaller decrease than we had from to we will have additional property additions in related to the completion of our digital roll out and the expansion of our news 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or 
corporate general and administrative expense represents the cost to operate our corporate headquarters location 
such costs include corporate departmental salaries  bonuses and fringe benefits  directors and officers liability insurance  rent  telecommunications  consulting fees  legal and accounting fees and director fees 
corporate departments include executive committee  treasury  finance and accounting  human resources  technology  corporate relations  legal  sales  operations  purchasing  programming  corporate direct mail administration and centralized news 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses primarily relates to an increase of million for the launch of our centralized news and weather format as well as the centralization of our promotion and programming operations  consulting fees of million  increased costs for telecommunications related to upgrades of million  insurance costs of million  administrative expenses related to our direct mail initiative of million and other miscellaneous increases in expense of million 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  or 
the increase in interest expense resulted from the higher interest expense from the redemption of hytops  offset by financing of indebtedness at lower interest rates during july  november  and december and may subsidiary trust minority interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or  as a result of the redemption of hytops in june of our income tax provision was million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  our tax rate changed to a provision in  from a benefit in  because we reported taxable net income in  compared to a net loss in the effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  years ended december  and during  we continued to see strengthening in our broadcast business even without regard to the significant inflow of political advertising revenues 
net broadcast revenues  excluding political revenues  grew despite the economy not being in a full recovery and a threat of war looming 
the growth came from both the local and national markets 
throughout  our quarterly revenues  excluding political  grew at successively higher growth rates 
net loss available to shareholders for the year ended december  was million or net loss of per share compared to net loss of million or loss of per share for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  was largely the result of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of operations  net of the related tax benefit of million during the first quarter this was a non cash charge which had no effect on our liquidity or capital resources currently or prospectively 
without this charge  our net loss available to shareholders during the year ended december  would have been million 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  in our notes to our consolidated financial statements 
net broadcast revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  or 
the year ending december  was positively impacted by higher advertising revenues generated from the political  automotive  services  restaurants  home products  schools and beer wine  offset by weakness in the fast food and soft drink sectors

during the year ended december  we estimate that we had decreased revenues of million related to the terrorist attacks of september  national revenues  excluding political revenues  declined million to million or  during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  local revenues  excluding political revenues  increased million to million  or  during the year ended december  from million during same station basis is a comparison of only the stations that we owned or provided programming and operating services pursuant to an lma for both entire years ending december  and comparing results on a same stations basis enhances the understanding of our business and revenue growth because we are able to disclose our ability to grow revenue at television stations owned and operated during the two most recent fiscal years 
this enables us to eliminate the impact of partial year activity of acquisitions and dispositions occurring during the two most recent fiscal years 
while reporting actual historical results for all stations owned and operated during the fiscal year is vital to understanding our performance  we believe that it is important to analyze stations owned during both fiscal years as a measure of our operating performance 
on a same station basis for the year ended december   national revenues including political revenues increased million  or  and local sales increased million  or  over the increase in national revenues was primarily due to the increase in political revenues 
the increase in local revenues is related to our continued focus on developing a strong local sales force at each of our stations 
in addition  for the year ended december   the events of september  had a direct impact on the revenues of media related businesses 
the terrorist attacks led to the pre emption and cancellation of advertisements  which caused an estimated million revenue loss during the network affiliations that experienced the largest revenue growth for the year ended december  were our nbc and cbs affiliates which increased and  respectively  compared with the year ended december  our abc and fox affiliates experienced revenue growth of and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the wb affiliates revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the upn affiliates revenue decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  other revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  or 
the decrease in revenue relates to a decreased demand for services from our software development and consulting company  due to the slow economy and a decrease in revenue of million related to the closing of the san francisco office during the first quarter station production expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating costs related to a decrease of million related to our lma fees  due to the acquisition of television broadcast licenses during the three months ended march  our results of operations from lma stations are typically lower than they would have been if we had owned the televisions stations 
the results of operations of our lma stations was lower because of higher programming and production expenses due to the incurrence of the lma fees 
news costs decreased by million related to the discontinuation of news at our stations kdnl tv  st 
louis  missouri and wxlv tv  winston salem  north carolina 
in addition  other miscellaneous production expense decreased by million 
these decreases were offset by increases of million in engineering costs  million related to music license fees  million in programming fees related to increased costs for affiliate agreements  million in rating service fees  and million related to increased promotional spending during the may sweeps 
station selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales commissions increased by million as a result of improved sales 
this increase was offset by decreases of million related to a decrease in national representation commissions  million related to a reduction in bad debt expense  and million related to traffic costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was related to the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in the discontinuation of amortization of our goodwill and broadcast licenses 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by million  offset by an increase aggregating million related to amortization of our program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments related to our addition of new programming primarily consisting of dharma greg and will grace as well as write downs primarily related to additional seasons for frasier  drew carey  spin city  just shoot me  and third rock from the sun and an increase in fixed asset depreciation of million related to our property additions  primarily resulting from our digital television conversion 
for the year ended december   we did not incur any restructuring charges  impairment and write down of long lived assets except for the impact of adopting sfas no 
or contract termination costs 
during the three months ended march   we offered a voluntary early retirement program to our eligible employees and implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating and overhead costs 
as a result  we reduced our staff by employees and incurred a restructuring charge of million  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during september  our station kdnl tv in st 
louis  missouri  discontinued programming its local news broadcast 
as a result  we incurred a restructuring charge of million

during the year ended december   we incurred an impairment and write down of long lived assets of million and contract termination costs of million 
operating income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or 
the net increase in operating income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization due to the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in the discontinuation of amortization of our goodwill and fcc licenses offset by an increase in program contract amortization expense and property and equipment depreciation expense as discussed above 
operating income was also affected by a decrease in program and production expenses due to the acquisition of television broadcast licenses resulting in our ability to operate at a cost lower than operating those stations as lma structures and reduced spending for sweeps promotion due to direct competition from the olympics 
during the year ended december   we incurred a loss of million related to a write down charge of long lived assets 
this charge is comprised of goodwill related to our software development company and our station kbsi tv in paducah  kentucky  and a write off of fixed assets which represent the net book value of damaged  obsolete or abandoned property 
we also incurred contract termination costs of million and restructuring charges of million as a result of a voluntary early retirement program and cancellation of local news programs during the year ended december we did not incur any write down charge of long lived assets  contract termination or restructuring charges for the year ended december  interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  resulted from the refinancing of indebtedness at lower interest rates during december  march  july  november and december and an overall lower interest rate environment 
our income tax provision was million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate from continuing operations increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase is primarily because prior to the implementation of sfas no 
for our reported income in was reduced by amortization of goodwill  which was non deductible for tax purposes 
loss related to investments decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the loss related to investments for the year ended december  primarily relates to a loss of million as a result of a write down of our investment in allegiance capital  a loss of million from the sale of our interest in synergy brands  inc  offset by a gain of million related to proceeds of a settlement to shareholders of acrodyne 
we recognized income from discontinued operations of million  which includes a gain on the sale of wttv tv in indianapolis  indiana of million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we reported a million loss related to the call premium and write off of deferred financing costs and interest  net of taxes  resulting from the repayment of our million term loan facility and bank credit agreement and the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due and our senior subordinated notes due for the year ended december   we reported a million loss related to the call premium and write off of deferred financing costs and interest  net of taxes  resulting from the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  and amendments to our bank credit agreement 
as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  one of our derivatives does not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment 
therefore  this derivative must be recognized in the balance sheet at fair market value and the changes in fair market value are reflected in earnings 
as a result  we recognized million of losses during and million of losses during recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements nos 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections on january  sfas no 
requires us to record gains and losses on extinguishment of debt as a component of income from continuing operations rather than as an extraordinary item and we have reclassified such items for all periods presented 
there are other provisions contained in sfas no 
that do not have a material effect on our financial statements 
for the year ended december   net loss from continuing operations increased to million from net income of million and the related loss per share increased to per share from loss per share after we reclassified our extraordinary item 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
fin introduces the variable interest consolidation model  which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation 
the fasb delayed the effective date of fin for certain variable interest entities until the first interim period ending after december  we are currently assessing various transactions to determine whether they could be considered a variable interest entity vie and whether we would be the primary beneficiary under the amended guidance of fin we have determined that the unrelated third party owner of wnab tv in nashville may be a vie and that we may be the primary beneficiary of the variable interests as a result of the terms of our outsourcing agreement  put options and call options 
as a result  we may be required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of wnab tv at their fair market values as of march  and we are currently assessing the impact of consolidating wnab tv on our results of operations 
we have not completed our analysis at this time 
we made payments to the unrelated third party owner of wnab tv of million and million related to our outsourcing agreement for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively 
on january   we made an million non refundable deposit against the purchase price of the put or call option on the non license assets 
we believe that our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with wnab tv consists of the fees that we pay related to the outsourcing agreement as well as any payments that we would be required to make under the put options held by the current owner related to the license and non license assets 
see note  commitments and contingencies  wnab options in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we have determined that cunningham broadcasting corporation cunningham is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interests 
we already consolidate cunningham  therefore  the implementation of fin will not have a material effect on our financial statements with respect to our variable interest in cunningham 
we made lma payments to cunningham of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we received payments from cunningham of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with cunningham consists of the fees that we pay related to the lma agreements as well as payments that we would make as a result of exercising our option to acquire cunningham  which provides for an option exercise price based on a formula that provides a annual return to cunningham 
see note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the applicability of fin on our lmas and outsourcing agreements and the possible impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are currently reviewing these agreements to determine if the licensor represents a variable interest entity to us 
we believe the exposure to loss because of our involvement with the license holder for each station is minimal and can be measured by the incremental depreciation expense from the addition of the fixed assets of the license holder 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
eitf does not otherwise change the applicable revenue recognition criteria 
we adopted issue on july  and have determined that our direct mail agreements constitute revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that contain more than one unit of accounting 
consequently  we allocate the consideration that we receive for certain of these agreements between television accounting units and direct mail accounting units and we recognize the revenue and related expenses when the television spots are aired and when the direct mail pieces are mailed  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and availability under our bank credit agreement 
the bank credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility maturing on june  and a million term loan b facility repayable in consecutive quarterly installments  amortizing per quarter  commencing june  and continuing through its maturity on december  the applicable interest rate on the revolving credit facility is either libor plus to or the alternative base rate plus to adjusted quarterly based on the ratio of total debt  net of cash  to four quarters trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted in accordance with the bank credit agreement 
the applicable interest rate on the term loan b facility is either libor plus or the alternative base rate plus 
availability under the revolving credit facility does not reduce incrementally and terminates at maturity 
we are required to prepay the term loan facility and reduce the revolving credit facility with i of the net proceeds of any casualty loss or condemnation and  ii of the net proceeds of any sale or other disposition of our assets in excess of million in the aggregate for any fiscal year  to the extent not used to acquire new assets 
as of december   we had million in cash balances and working capital of approximately million 
we anticipate that cash flow from our operations and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations  dividend requirements  capital expenditure requirements and operating cash needs for the next year 
as of february   we had borrowed million under our term loan b facility and had not borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
the remaining balance available under the revolving credit facility was million as of february  our ability to draw down our line of credit is based on pro forma trailing cash flow levels as defined in our bank credit agreement and for the twelve months ended december   we had approximately million available of current borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
on april   we filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which will permit us to offer and sell various types of securities from time to time 
offered securities may include common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares or any combination thereof in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when the securities are offered 
if we determine it is in our best interest to offer any such securities  we intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  the reduction  redemption or refinancing of debt or other obligations  acquisitions  capital expenditures  and working capital 
during may  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due convertible notes 
the convertible notes were issued at par  mature on july   and have the following characteristics the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock at the option of the holder upon certain circumstances 
the conversion price is until march  at which time the conversion price increases quarterly until reaching on july  the notes may be put to us at par on january   or called thereafter by us 
the notes bear cash interest at an annual rate of until january  and bear cash interest at an annual rate of from january  through maturity 
the principal amount of the notes will accrete to of the original par amount from january  to maturity so that when combined with the cash interest  the yield to maturity of the notes will be per year 
under certain circumstances  we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the convertible notes during any six month period from january to july and from july to january  commencing with the six month period beginning january  this contingent interest feature is an embedded derivative which had a negligible fair value as of december  we used the net proceeds from this private placement  along with the net proceeds from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due  to finance the redemption of the high yield trust originated preferred securities due hytops to repay debt outstanding under our bank credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 
net costs associated with the offering totaled million 
these costs were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
during may  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes  which was an add on issuance under the indenture relating to our senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes were issued at a price of plus accrued interest from march  to may   yielding a rate of 
we used the net proceeds  along with the net proceeds received in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes  to finance the redemption of the hytops and for general corporate purposes 
net costs associated with the offering totaled million 
these costs were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior subordinated notes 
on june   we redeemed the million aggregate principal amount of the hytops  plus the associated call premium and accrued interest thereon 
the redemption was funded through the issuance of the senior subordinated notes due and the convertible notes 
we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of million consisting of a million call premium  a write off of the previous debt acquisition costs of million and consideration and other fees of million 
the guarantors of our registered debt securities are owned by the parent and are comprised of certain of our subsidiaries whose guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several 
see note in our consolidated financial statements for the condensed consolidating financial statements of our guarantor and non guarantor subsidiaries 
neither the parent nor the guarantors have any significant restrictions on their ability to obtain funds from their subsidiaries in the form of dividends or loans 
we hold two interest rate swap agreements that have a total notional amount of million that expire on june  during june  we assigned million of the notional amount to a second financial institution 
the instrument with a notional amount of million contains a european style that is  exercisable only on the expiration date termination option and can be terminated partially or in full by the counterparty on june  and june  at its fair market value 
we estimate the fair market value of the million agreement at december  to be million based on a quotation from the counterparty and this amount is reflected as a component of other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  if the counterparty chooses to partially or fully exercise its option to terminate the agreement  we will fund the payment from cash generated from our operating activities and or borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
the weighted average interest rates for outstanding indebtedness relating to our bank credit agreement during and as of december  were and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rates of our bank credit agreement during and as of december  were and  respectively 
during  the interest expense relating to the bank credit agreements was million 
this trend primarily relates to a lower interest rate environment and there can be no assurances that this trend will continue 
net cash flows from operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we received income tax refunds net of payments of million for the year ended december  as compared to income tax refunds  net of payments of million for the year ended december  interest payments on outstanding indebtedness and payments for subsidiary trust minority interest expense decreased million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest payments was primarily due to the refinancing of indebtedness during november  december  and may and the lower rates on our bank credit agreement described above 
see note notes payable and commercial bank financing in our notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the refinancing of our indebtedness 
program rights payments decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash flows from investing activities of million for the year ended december  the positive cash flow from investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to the sale of wttv tv broadcast assets and repayments of notes receivable 
for the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from the sale of wttv tv  million related to the sale of broadcast assets  and million for the repayment of notes receivable 
during  there was no similar activity 
during the year ended december   we made cash payments of million for the acquisition of broadcast assets  million for the purchase of equity investments  and payments for property and equipment of million  of which million related to digital conversion costs and million related to implementation of our news central format 
during the year ended december   we made equity investments of approximately million and we made payments for property and equipment of million of which million related to digital conversion costs 
we funded these acquisitions using cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for  we anticipate incurring approximately million of capital expenditures  of which approximately million is intended to substantially complete our digital television roll out  million is for station maintenance and equipment replacement  million is to consolidate building and tower needs in some markets and million is for the addition of news central in two additional markets 
in addition  we anticipate that future requirements for expenditures will include expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and additional strategic station acquisitions and equity investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and funding from our revolving credit facility  issuance of securities pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement described above or a private placement of securities 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december  compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repaid a net of million  whereas in the comparable period in  we repaid a net of million in indebtedness 
we incurred deferred financing costs of million related to the add on issuance of our senior subordinated notes and issuance of our convertible notes  we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of the hytops utilizing million from the net issuances for the hytops principal and call premium  and we repurchased million of our class a common stock for the year ended december  in comparison  during the year ended december   we paid deferred financing costs of million 
during the year ended december   we received million related to the termination of two of our derivative instruments with no similar activity occurring during for the year ended december  and  we paid quarterly dividends of million on our series d preferred stock 
we expect to incur these dividend payments in each of our future quarters and expect to fund these dividends with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
income taxes the income tax provision from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our pre tax book income from continuing operations was million and for the year ended december   our pre tax book loss from continuing operations was million 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax liability of million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of million as of december  the increase in deferred taxes primarily relates to deferred tax liabilities associated with book and tax differences relating to the amortization and depreciation of intangible assets and fixed assets  offset by deferred tax assets resulting from federal and state net operating losses nols generated during our tax rate changed to a provision in from a benefit in because we reported net income in compared to a net loss in the effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  seasonality cyclicality our results usually are subject to seasonal fluctuations  which usually cause fourth quarter operating income to be greater than first  second and third quarter operating income 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
in addition  revenues from political advertising and the olympics are higher in even numbered years 
indebtedness and other commitments indebtedness under the bank credit agreement  as amended 
as of december   we owed million under the bank credit agreement  as amended  and had a million remaining balance available 
indebtedness under notes 
we have issued and outstanding three series of senior subordinated notes with aggregate principal amount issued and outstanding of billion 
series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
we have issued  shares of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million 
the liquidation preference means we would be required to pay the holders of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock million before we paid holders of common stock or any other stock that is junior to the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock in any liquidation of sinclair 
we are not obligated to buy back or retire the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock  but may do so at our option at a conversion rate of per share 
in some circumstances  we may also exchange the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for subordinated debentures due with an aggregate principal amount of million 
program contracts payable and programming commitments 
total current and long term program contracts payable at december  were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we enter into commitments to purchase future programming 
under these commitments  we were obligated on december  to make future payments totaling million 
other 
our commitments also include capital leases  operating leases  sports programming  personnel contracts and other liabilities 
the amount of these commitments may be material 
contractual cash obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are contractually committed to acquire future programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  and thereafter total in thousands notes payable  capital leases  and commercial bank financing notes and capital leases payable to affiliates fixed rate derivative instrument operating leases employment contracts film liability active film liability future programming services maintenance and support other operating contracts total contractual cash obligations payments due by year and thereafter total in thousands other commercial commitments letters of credit guarantees investments network affiliation agreements purchase options lma and outsourcing agreements total other commercial commitments only includes interest on fixed rate debt 
future film liabilities reflect a license agreement for program material that is not yet available for its first showing or telecast 
per sfas no 
 financial reporting for broadcasters  an asset and a liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred under a license agreement are reported on the balance sheet when the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable  the program material has been accepted by the licensee in accordance with the conditions of the license agreement and the program is available for its first showing or telecast 
commitments to contribute capital to allegiance capital  lp and sterling ventures partners  lp 
we have entered into an agreement with a third party  whereby the third party may require us to purchase certain license and non license broadcast assets at the option of the third party  no earlier than july  the contractual commitment for and beyond represents the increase in purchase option price should the exercise occur in or certain lmas require us to reimburse the licensee owner their operating costs 
certain outsourcing agreements require us to pay a fee to another station for providing non programming services 
the amount will vary each month and  accordingly  these amounts were estimated through the date of the agreements expiration  based on historical cost experience 
risk factors we cannot identify nor can we control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
some of the circumstances that may occur and may impair our business are described below 
if any of the following circumstances were to occur  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
we have a high level of debt totaling  million compared to the book value of shareholders equity of million 
our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks  particularly in periods of declining revenues we use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends on preferred stock  limiting the amount available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs  additional acquisitions  or other purposes 
the interest rate under the bank credit agreement  as amended  is a floating rate  and will increase if general interest rates increase 
this will reduce the funds available to repay our obligations and for operations and future business opportunities  and will make us more vulnerable to the consequences of our leveraged capital structure 
we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures 
if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments  we might have to refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations 
our ability to finance our working capital needs and general corporate purposes for the public and private markets  as well as the associated cost of funding is dependent  in part  by out credit ratings 
as of december   our credit ratings  as assigned by moody s investor services moody s and standard poor s ratings services s p are moody s s p senior secured credit facilities ba bb senior implied ba senior unsecured issuer ba corporate credit bb senior subordinated notes b b convertible senior subordinated notes b b convertible preferred stock caa b any of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment or debt repayment or to make improvements or respond to events that would enhance profitability we may be able to incur significantly more debt in the future  which will increase each of the foregoing risks related to our indebtedness 
at december   we had an additional million available subject to certain borrowing conditions for additional borrowings under the bank credit agreement 
in addition  under the terms of our debt instruments  we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including additional senior debt and in some cases secured debt 
provided we meet certain financial and other covenants  the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding notes do not prohibit us from incurring such additional indebtedness 
if we incur additional indebtedness  the risks described above relating to having substantial debt could intensify 
our advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control 
this volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities 
we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues and as a result  our operating results are sensitive to the amount of advertising revenue we generate 
if we generate less revenue  it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of all our business may decline 
our ability to sell advertising time depends on the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located  pricing fluctuations in local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  particularly network  cable television  direct satellite television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and other factors that may be beyond our control 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our advertising revenue has decreased significantly from levels prior to and our revenues and earnings have been  and may continue to be  adversely affected 
the iraq war resulted in a decline in advertising revenues and negatively impacted our operating results 
future conflicts may have a similar effect 
the war in iraq resulted in a reduction in advertising revenues as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty 
during the first quarter  we experienced million in advertiser cancellations and preemptions  which resulted in lower earnings than we would have experienced without this disruption 
if the united states becomes engaged in similar conflicts in the future  they may have a similar adverse impact on our results of operations 
promises we have made to our lenders limit our ability to take actions that could increase the value of our securities or may require us to take actions that decrease the value of our securities 
our existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests 
these restrictions and tests may require us to conduct our business in ways that make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness or decrease the value of our business 
these restrictions and tests include the following restrictions on additional debt  restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for our indebtedness  restrictions on payment of dividends  the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to capital stock  restrictions on some sales of assets and the use of proceeds of asset sales  restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions  satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions  and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without consent of bank lenders  restrictions on the type of businesses we and our subsidiaries may be in  restrictions on the type and amounts of investments we and our subsidiaries may make  and financial ratio and condition tests including the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted adjusted ebitda to total interest expense  the ratio of adjusted ebitda to certain of our fixed expenses  and the ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda 
future financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests 
all of these restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies  prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities  or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities 
in addition  we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations particularly if the economy continues to soften and thereby reduces our advertising revenues 
if we default on our obligations  creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral 
if this happened  we could be forced to sell assets or take other action that would reduce significantly the value of our securities and we may not have sufficient assets or funds to pay our debt obligations 
key officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite to those of sinclair and sinclair may engage in transactions with these officers and directors that may benefit them to the detriment of other securityholders 
some of our officers  directors and majority shareholders own stock or partnership interests in businesses that engage in television broadcasting  do business with us  or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests 
they may transact some business with us even when there is a conflict of interest or they may engage in business competitive to our business and those transactions may benefit the officers  directors or majority shareholders to the detriment of our other securityholders 
david d

smith  and j 
duncan smith are each an officer and director of sinclair  and robert e 
smith is a director of sinclair 
together  the smiths hold shares of our common stock that control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders 
the smiths own a television station which is programmed pursuant to an lma with us 
the smiths also own businesses that lease real property and tower space to us  buy advertising time from us  and engage in other transactions with us 
in addition  david d 
smith  our president and chief executive officer  has a controlling interest in and is a member of the board of directors of summa holdings  ltd  a company in which we hold a equity interest and exercise significant influence over summa by virtue of david d

we can give no assurance that these transactions  or any transactions that we may enter into in the future with our officers  directors or majority shareholders  have been  or will be  negotiated on terms as favorable to us as we would obtain from unrelated parties 
maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers  directors and majority shareholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that sinclair might pursue 
these limitations do not  however  prohibit all such transactions 
the smiths exercise control over most matters submitted to a stockholder vote  and may have interests that differ from yours 
they may  therefore  take actions that are not in the interests of other securityholders 
david d 
smith  frederick g 
smith  j 
duncan smith and robert e 
smith hold shares representing almost of the vote and therefore control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders  including  but not limited to  electing directors  adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving corporate transactions 
the smiths hold class b common stock  which generally has votes per share 
our class a common stock has only one vote per share 
our other series of preferred stock generally do not have voting rights 
circumstances may occur in which the interests of the smiths  as the controlling equity holders  could be in conflict with the interests of the minority shareholders and the smiths would have the ability to cause sinclair to take actions in their interest 
in addition  the smiths could pursue acquisitions  divestitures or other transactions that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment  even though such transactions might involve risks to other sinclair security holders 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters 
certain features of our capital structure that discourage others from attempting to acquire sinclair may prevent our securityholders from receiving a premium on their securities or result in a lower price for our securities 
the control the smiths have over shareholder votes may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 
in addition  our board of directors can issue additional shares of preferred stock with rights that might further discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 
anyone trying to acquire us would likely offer to pay more for shares of class a common stock than the amount those shares were trading for in the market at the time of the offer 
if the voting rights of the smiths or the right to issue preferred stock discourage such takeover attempts  shareholders may be denied the opportunity to receive such a premium 
the general level of prices for class a common stock might also be lower than it would be if these deterrents to takeovers did not exist 
we must purchase television programming in advance and may therefore incur programming costs that we cannot cover with revenue from the programs 
if this happens  we could experience losses that make our securities less valuable 
one of our most significant costs is television programming and our ability to generate revenue to cover this cost may affect the value of our securities 
if a particular program is not popular in relation to its costs  we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program 
since we generally purchase programming content from others rather than produce it ourselves  we also have little control over the costs of programming 
we usually must purchase programming several years in advance  and may have to commit to purchase more than one year s worth of programming 
finally  we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred  or accounted fully for the costs on our books for financial reporting purposes 
any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues 
these factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market 
additionally  our business is subject to the popularity of the programs provided by the networks with which we have affiliation agreements or which provide us programming 
excluding political revenue  each of our affiliation groups experienced revenue increases in  but this trend may not continue in the future 
we may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation with us  which could increase our costs and or reduce our revenue 
the nbc affiliation agreements with wics wicd champaign springfield  illinois and wkef tv dayton  ohio are scheduled to expire on april  nbc recently informed us that they intend to terminate our affiliations in dayton and champaign springfield effective on or about september and september  respectively  in order to affiliate with another station in each of those markets 
we are currently engaged in discussions with the abc television network regarding affiliating with abc in those two markets since the stations which are scheduled to acquire the nbc affiliations in dayton and champaign springfield are currently abc affiliates and will be giving up that affiliation in order to become nbc affiliates 
the affiliation agreements of three abc stations wear tv in pensacola  florida  wchs tv in charleston  west virginia  and wxlv tv in greensboro winston salem  north carolina have expired 
we continue to operate these stations as abc affiliates and we do not believe abc has any current plans to terminate the affiliation agreements with any of these stations although we cannot assure that abc will do so 
the following affiliate agreements are scheduled to expire during the abc affiliate agreements with wlos tv and wsyx tv  are scheduled to expire on september  the upn affiliate agreements with wabm tv  wmmp tv  wcgv tv  wuxp tv  and wrdc tv are scheduled to expire on july   the upn affiliate agreement with wupn tv is scheduled to expire in june the cbs affiliate agreement with kgan tv and wgme tv are scheduled to expire on december  the non renewal or termination of one or more of these or any of our other network affiliation agreements would result in us no longer being able to carry programming of the relevant network 
this loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming  which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences  resulting in reduced revenues 
competition from other broadcasters and changes in technology may cause a reduction in our advertising revenues and or an increase in our operating costs 
the television industry is highly competitive and this competition can draw viewers and advertisers from our stations  which reduces our revenue  or requires us to pay more for programming  which increases our costs 
we face intense competition from the following new technology and the subdivision of markets cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences  reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets 
competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues 
lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue 
in addition  emerging technologies that will allow viewers to digitally record  store and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
in market competition we also face more conventional competition from rivals that may be larger and have greater resources than we have 
these include other local free over the air broadcast stations  and other media  such as newspapers  periodicals and cable systems 
deregulation the telecommunications act of and subsequent actions by the fcc have removed some limits on station ownership  allowing telephone  cable and some other companies to provide video services in competition with us 
in addition  the fcc has reallocated a portion of the spectrum for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services 
as a result of these changes  new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us 
the phased introduction of digital television will increase our costs  due to increased equipment and operational costs  and could have a variety of other adverse effects on our business 
the fcc has adopted rules for implementing digital including high definition television dtv service in the united states 
under the rules  our stations are required to begin dtv operations over a transition period 
in addition  we expect that the fcc will reclaim our non digital channels at the end of the transition period 
we believe that the transition to dtv may have the following effects on us  which could increase our costs or reduce our revenue 
conversion and programming costs we expect to incur approximately million in costs  of which we have incurred million through december   to convert our stations from the current analog format to digital format 
however  our costs may be higher than this estimate 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs to convert our stations to digital format 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to obtain programming for the additional channels made available by digital technology and higher utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations 
increased revenues from the additional channels may not make up for the conversion cost and additional programming expenses 
possible sanctions the fcc has adopted a series of graduated sanctions to be imposed upon licensees who do not meet the fcc s dtv build out schedule 
some of our stations could face monetary fines and possible loss of any digital construction permits if they cannot comply with the dtv build out schedule 
reclamation of analog channels congress directed the fcc to auction analog channels when the current holders convert to digital transmission 
in addition  the fcc has reallocated a portion of the spectrum band to permit both wireless services and to allow new broadcast operations 
if the channels are owned or programmed by our competitors  they may exert increased competitive pressure on our operations 
signal quality issues our signal quality under digital transmission may be lower relative to our competitors  and we may lose viewers and thereby lose revenue  or be forced to rely on cable television or other alternative means of transmission with higher costs to deliver our digital signals to all of the viewers we are able to reach with our current analog signals 
digital must carry if the fcc does not require cable companies to carry both analog and digital signals of stations during the digital transition period  cable customers in our broadcast markets may not receive our digital signal  which could negatively impact our stations by reducing revenue 
subscription fees the fcc has determined to assess a fee in the amount of of gross revenues on digital television subscription services 
if we provide subscription services and are unable to pass this cost through to our subscribers  this fee will reduce our earnings from any digital television subscription services we implement in the future 
given this climate of market uncertainty and regulatory change  we cannot be sure what impact the fcc s actions might have on our plans and results in the area of digital television 
see item business federal regulation of television broadcasting 
federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility  which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs 
the fcc regulates our business  just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry 
we must ask the fcc s approval whenever we need a new license  seek to renew  or assign  or modify a license  purchase a new station  or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license 
our fcc licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to lmas are critical to our operations  we cannot operate without them 
we cannot be certain that the fcc will renew these licenses in the future  or approve new acquisitions 
if licenses were not renewed or acquisitions approved  we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned 
in addition  congress and the fcc may in the future adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes that could  directly or indirectly  materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties 
the fcc s multiple ownership rules limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs 
changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets 
general limitations the ownership rules currently being applied by the fcc limit us from having attributable interests in television stations that reach more than using a calculation method specified by the fcc of all television households in the us we reach approximately of us television households on an actual basis or  under the fcc s current method for calculating this limit  approximately 
congress recently passed a bill requiring the fcc to establish a national audience reach cap of  and president bush signed the bill into law on january  additionally  the fcc s ownership rules limit the number of television stations an entity can own or control in a local market 
our ability to expand through the acquisition of additional stations is limited by these rules  and this may prevent us from engaging in acquisitions that could increase our revenue or our operating margins 
the fcc has adopted new multiple ownership rules 
the court of appeals for the third circuit has stayed the effective date of the new fcc ownership rules pending its review of those rules 
we cannot predict the outcome of that decision 
changes to the rules imposed by the third circuit or by the fcc on remand could significantly impact our business 
if the new rules become law  broadcast television owners would be permitted to own more television stations  both locally and nationally  potentially affecting our competitive position 
changes in the rules on television ownership and local marketing agreements certain of our stations have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or lmas 
one typical type of lma is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such program segments on the other licensee s station subject to the ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee 
we believe these arrangements allow us to reduce our operating expenses and enhance profitability 
although under the new fcc ownership rules  which have been stayed pending judicial review  we would be allowed to continue to program most of the stations with which we have an lma  in the absence of a waiver  the new rules would require us to terminate or modify three of our lmas in markets where both the stations we own and the station with which we have an lma are ranked among the top four stations in their particular dma 
the fcc s new ownership rules include specific provisions permitting waivers of this top four restriction 
although there can be no assurances  we have studied the application of the new rules to our markets and believe we are qualified for waivers 
because the effectiveness of the new rules has been stayed and the fcc concluded the old rules could not be justified as necessary to the public interest  we have taken the position that an issue exists regarding whether the fcc has any current legal right to enforce any rules prohibiting the acquisition of television stations 
if we are required to terminate or modify our lmas  our business could be affected in the following ways losses on investments 
as part of our lma arrangements  we own the non license assets used by the stations with which we have lmas 
if certain of these lma arrangements are no longer permitted  we would be forced to sell these assets  restructure our agreements or find another use for them 
if lmas are prohibited  the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and we would need to sell the assets to the owner or purchaser of the related license assets 
therefore  we cannot be certain we will recoup our investments 
termination penalties 
if the fcc requires us to modify or terminate existing lmas before the terms of the lmas expire  or under certain circumstances  we elect not to extend the term of the lmas  we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our lmas 
any such termination penalty could be material 
failure of owner licensee to exercise control the fcc requires the owner licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station 
as a result  the owners licensees of those stations with which we have lmas or outsourcing agreements can exert their control in ways that may counter our interests  including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances 
the preemption and termination rights cause some uncertainty as to whether we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased  and therefore  uncertainty about the advertising revenue that we will receive from such programming 
in addition  if the fcc determines that the owner licensee is not exercising sufficient control  it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine  revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of that license 
any one of these scenarios might result in a reduction of our cash flow and an increase in our operating costs or margins  especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license 
in addition  penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold fcc licenses and thus put those licenses at risk 
we have lost money in two of the last five years  and may continue to incur losses in the future  which may impair our ability to pay our debt obligations 
we reported earnings in  but we have suffered net losses in two of the last five years 
in and  we reported earnings  but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio stations 
our losses are due to a variety of cash and non cash expenses which may or may not recur 
our net losses may therefore continue indefinitely and as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to operate our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we enter into interest rate derivative hedging agreements 
interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which arise from our floating rate debt 
as of december   we were obligated on million of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate 
we enter into interest rate derivative agreements to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt 
as of december   we had two floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements  which expire on june  the swap agreements effectively set fixed rates on our floating rate debt in the range of to 
floating interest rates are based upon the three month libor  and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
settlements of these agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods 
the notional amount related to these agreements was million at december  in addition  as of december   we had four fixed to floating rate derivatives with notional amounts of million  million and two at million 
at december   we had million of floating rate debt all which was effectively converted to fixed rate debt by way of a swap 
additionally  we had billion of fixed rate debt at december  of which million was converted to floating rate debt by way of a swap 
consequently  we had million of floating rate debt at december  and a increase in libor rate would result in annualized interest expense of approximately million 
we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior subordinated notes totaling million  million and million expiring in the years  and  respectively 
based upon the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes was billion as of december  generally  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately million as of december  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to one of our derivative instruments 
our million notional amount interest rate swap agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 therefore  changes in its fair market value are reflected currently in earnings as unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments 
we incurred an unrealized gain of million during the year ended december  and an unrealized loss of million during the year ended december  we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in a gain of million  while a decrease would result in a loss of million
