item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description chesapeake utilities corporation chesapeake or the company is a diversified utility company engaged in natural gas distribution and transmission  propane distribution and wholesale marketing  advanced information services and other related businesses 
liquidity and capital resources chesapeake s capital requirements reflect the capital intensive nature of its business and are principally attributable to the construction program and the retirement of outstanding debt 
the company relies on cash generated from operations and short term borrowing to meet normal working capital requirements and temporarily to finance capital expenditures 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  cash used by investing activities was million and cash used by financing activities was million 
cash provided by operating activities declined by million from to  as higher income in was more than offset by changes in working capital items 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million from to  as increases in current liabilities and non cash charges related to goodwill impairment more than offset a decline in income 
the company completed a private placement of million of long term debt on october  the debt has a fixed interest rate of percent and is due october  the funds were used to repay short term borrowing 
as of december   the board of directors has authorized the company to borrow up to million of short term debt from various banks and trust companies 
on december   chesapeake had five unsecured bank lines of credit with three financial institutions  totaling million  for short term cash needs to meet seasonal working capital requirements and temporarily to fund portions of its capital expenditures 
two of the bank lines  totaling million  are committed 
the other three lines are subject to the banks availability of funds 
prior to the issuance of the million long term debt on october   the board had authorized the company to borrow up to million of short term debt 
the outstanding balances of short term borrowing at december  and were million and million  respectively 
in and  chesapeake used funds provided by operations to fund net investing and financing activities 
during  and  net cash used for investing activities totaled approximately  and million  respectively 
cash used by investing activities was down in compared to  due to the combination of reduced capital expenditures and cash provided by the sales of the water businesses and recoveries of environmental costs 
additions to property  plant and equipment totaled million and were primarily for natural gas distribution million  propane distribution million and natural gas transmission million 
the property  plant and equipment expenditures for were primarily for natural gas distribution million and natural gas transmission million 
in both and  natural gas distribution utilized funds to improve facilities and expand facilities to serve new customers 
natural gas transmission spending related primarily to expanding its system 
capital expenditures in were high primarily as a result of eastern shore natural gas expenditures  totaling million  related to a system expansion 
natural gas distribution also spent approximately million in for expansion of facilities to serve new customers and for improvements of facilities 
the increase in intangibles shown on the cash flow statement was related to acquisitions of water companies 
chesapeake has budgeted million for capital expenditures during this amount includes million for natural gas distribution and transmission  million for propane distribution and marketing   for advanced information services and  for other operations 
the natural gas distribution and transmission expenditures are for expansion and improvement of facilities 
the propane expenditures are to support customer growth and for the replacement of equipment 
the advanced information services expenditures are for computer hardware  software and related equipment 
the other category includes general plant  computer software and hardware 
financing for the capital expenditure program is expected to be provided from short term borrowing and cash provided by operating activities 
the capital expenditure program is subject to continuous review and modification 
actual capital requirements may vary from the above estimates due to a number of factors  including acquisition opportunities  changing economic conditions  customer growth in existing areas  regulation  new growth opportunities and availability of capital 
chesapeake expects to incur approximately  in and  in for environmental related expenditures 
additional expenditures may be required in future years see note n to the consolidated financial statements

chesapeake remains committed to maintaining a sound capital structure and strong credit ratings to provide the financial flexibility needed to access the capital markets when required 
this commitment  along with adequate and timely rate relief for the company s regulated operations  is intended to ensure that chesapeake will be able to attract capital from outside sources at a reasonable cost 
the company believes that the achievement of these objectives will provide benefits to customers and creditors  as well as to the company s investors

chesapeake repaid approximately million and million of long term debt in and  respectively 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt      operating leases      purchase obligations transmission capacity      storage natural gas      commodities   forward contracts propane   unfunded benefits      funded benefits      total contractual obligations      principal payments on long term debt  see note i  long term debt  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this item 
see note k  lease obligations  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this item 
see note o  other commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company has also entered into forward sale contracts of  see market risk of the management s discussion and analysis for further information 
the company has recorded long term liabilities of million at december  for unfunded post retirement benefit plans 
the schedule of cash outflows above is based on expected payments to current retirees and assumes a retirement age of for currently active employees 
there are many factors that would cause actual payments to differ from these amounts  including early retirement  future health care costs that differ from past experience and rates of return implicit in calculations 
the company has recorded long term liabilities of million at december  for funded benefits 
of this total   has been funded using a rabbi trust and an asset in the same amount is recorded in the investments caption on the balance sheet 
the other balance   represents a liability for a defined benefit pension plan 
the plan was closed to new participants on january  and participants in the plan on that date were given the option to leave the plan 
see note l  employee benefit plans  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the plan 
since the plan modification  no additional funding has been required from the company and none is expected for the next five years  based on factors in effect at december  however  this is subject to change based on the actual return earned by the plan assets and other actuarial assumptions  such as the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets and expected pay rate increases 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has issued corporate guarantees to certain vendors of its propane wholesale marketing subsidiary 
the corporate guarantees provide for the payment of propane purchases by the subsidiary  in the case of the subsidiary s default 
the guarantees at december   totaled million and expire on various dates in the company has issued a letter of credit to its main insurance company for  which expires june  results of operations net income from continuing operations for was million compared to restated net income of million for and million for net income for was million or per share compared to restated net income of million and million in and  respectively  and restated earnings per share of and in and  respectively 
during  chesapeake decided to exit the water services business and  at december   had sold the assets of six of seven dealerships 
the results of water services have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
discontinued operations experienced losses of  and per share for  and  respectively 
chesapeake adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in this resulted in a non cash charge of per share for goodwill impairment recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company has restated its and financial statements in order to reflect the results of its delaware and maryland natural gas divisions on the accrual rather than the as billed revenue recognition method 
this change had an insignificant effect on the company s annual results for the last three years 
under the as billed method  revenues from customer sales are not recognized until the meter is read and the amount of gas actually used is billed 
under the accrual method  at the end of each period  the amount of gas used is estimated and is recognized as revenue 
the company s florida division has historically used the accrual method in accordance with florida public service commission psc requirements 
the delaware and maryland divisions have historically used the as billed method to recognize revenues consistent with the rate setting processes in those states 
in order to consistently apply the accrual method  the company met separately with the staffs of the delaware and maryland public service commissions to determine the regulatory impact of the change 
having determined that there is little to no impact  the company has conformed the revenue recognition method used in its delaware and maryland divisions to the method used by its florida division 
in order to provide comparable information  the company has restated its and financial statements to reflect the accrual revenue recognition method 
as a result of the restatement  retained earnings of the company as of january  has increased by  compared to previously reported amounts 
the change had no impact on basic earnings per share 
there is no impact on fully diluted earnings per share in and a decrease in see note a to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this change

improvement in chesapeake s overall results is primarily related to strong customer growth and colder weather  which led to increased contributions from the company s delmarva natural gas and propane distribution operations 
the delmarva natural gas operations experienced an increase of percent in residential customers 
weather  measured in heating degree days  was percent colder than the florida natural gas operations  propane wholesale marketing operation and the advanced information services segment also improved operating income compared to however  decreases in operating income for the natural gas transmission operation and the florida propane distribution operation partially offset those improvements

     during  operating income increased over levels for the natural gas and propane segments  despite temperatures in the delmarva region that were percent warmer than both the year average and those increases were partially offset by declines in the advanced information services and other segments 
the advanced information services segment was adversely affected by a slowdown in the information technology services sector 
the following discussions of segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased gas cost for natural gas and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities for advanced information services 
this should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
chesapeake believes that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides them with valuable information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated operations and under its competitive pricing structure for non regulated segments  as another criteria in making investment decisions 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring certain performance goals and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
natural gas distribution and transmission the natural gas distribution and transmission segment earned operating income of million for compared to restated operating income of million for the corresponding period last year  an increase of million

     revenue and cost of gas increased in compared to and decreased in compared to  due primarily to changes in natural gas commodity costs 
commodity cost changes are passed on to the ratepayers through a gas cost recovery or purchased gas cost adjustment in all jurisdictions  therefore  they have no impact on the company s profitability 
revenue and cost of gas were also affected by the unbundling of services that took effect in for all nonresidential customers of the florida division and in november for residential customers 
as a result  all florida customers have switched from sales service  where they purchased both the commodity and transportation service from the company  to purchasing transportation service only 
gross margins for the delaware and maryland distribution divisions increased million in over temperatures in were percent colder than heating degree days and percent colder than the year average heating degree days 
the company estimates that  on an annual basis  for each heating degree day variance from the year average  gross margins change by  an increase in the average number of customers also contributed to the increase 
delaware and maryland experienced an increase of  in the average number of residential customers  or percent  in compared to the same period in the company estimates that each residential customer added contributes annually to gross margin and requires an additional cost of for operations and maintenance expenses 
also contributing to the increased margins were rate increases in delaware that were effective in december and volumetric increases for existing customers 
gross margin for the florida distribution operations increased million  due to the implementation of transportation services for residential customers and customer additions 
residential customer growth reached percent in florida  an increase of customers 
agreements with two new industrial customers also helped increase margins 
margins for the transmission operation increased by  in compared to an increase in interruptible transportation margins and volume added through a system expansion completed in november were partially offset by a rate reduction that was effective december the rate agreement is more fully discussed in the section below captioned regulatory matters 
the natural gas margin increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses  primarily operations and maintenance expenses and other taxes that relate to the increased volumes and earnings and pension and employee costs 
the natural gas distribution and transmission segment increased operating income to million for compared to restated operating income of million for  an increase of  restated gross margin increased million over the same period in due to increases in the margins for the transmission operation and the delaware and florida distribution operations 
transmission margins were up due to the completion of a major system expansion in november of this system expansion increased margins by approximately million per year 
margins in delaware and maryland were adversely impacted by temperatures that were percent warmer heating degree days than and percent heating degree days warmer than the year average 
this decline was more than offset by residential customer growth of  or percent  and a rate increase in delaware 
the margin increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses  primarily administrative and general and depreciation 
the increase in depreciation reflects completion of recent capital projects that increased the transmission capacity and various expansion projects in florida 
propane the propane segment experienced an increase in operating income of million  or percent over gross margin increased million  with an increase of only  in operating expenses

    the increases in revenues and cost of sales in compared to were caused both by increases in volumes and by increases in the commodity costs of propane 
commodity costs changes are generally passed on to the customer  subject to competitive market conditions 
the margin increase for the propane segment was due primarily to an increase of million for the delmarva distribution operations 
volumes sold in increased million gallons or percent 
temperatures in were percent colder than heating degree days and percent colder than the year average heating degree days 
the company estimates that on an annual basis  for each heating degree day variance from the year average  margins change by  additionally  the margin per retail gallon improved by in compared to the margin increase was partially offset by increased operating expenses  primarily related to the higher volumes  such as delivery costs  and incentive compensation costs associated with higher income 
the florida propane distribution operations experienced an increase in margins of  in  however  the margins included  related to a non recurring service project 
the company s propane wholesale marketing operation experienced an increase in margins of  and a decrease of  in operating expenses  leading to an improvement of  in operating income 
wholesale price volatility created trading opportunities during some portions of the year  however  these were partially offset by reduced trading activities particularly during the third quarter 
cost savings  primarily reduced taxes on propane inventory  have also helped to improve operating income for the period 
operating income for the propane segment increased from  in to million in reductions in operating expenses of  more than offset a decrease of  in gross margin 
propane revenues and costs were lower by million and million  respectively  due to a drop in propane commodity prices and volume decreases 
both increases and decreases in commodity costs  are generally passed on to the distribution customers subject to competitive market conditions 
propane wholesale marketing margins declined by million in compared to and were partially offset by a reduction of  in operating expenses 
the results reflected increased opportunities due to the extreme price volatility in the propane wholesale market 
the same level of price fluctuations was not experienced in additionally  there was a decrease in the number of suitable trading partners due to a decision by some companies to exit energy trading activities and the decreased credit worthiness of other parties 
the results reflected increased margins of approximately  that resulted from a bankrupt vendor defaulting on supply contracts during the first quarter of the supply was replaced by purchasing from different vendors at a lower cost than the original contract 
the delmarva distribution operations experienced an increase of  in gross margin in although volumes sold were down percent  higher margins per gallon and stable wholesale propane prices resulted in increased margin dollars 
volumes were negatively impacted by temperatures that were percent warmer than heating degree days and percent warmer than the year average heating degree days  increased competition and lower volume sales to the poultry industry 
operating expenses decreased by  resulting from cost containment efforts that began in april and remain in effect 
these efforts have reduced customer accounting  sales and marketing costs 
other costs  such as delivery expenses  decreased due to the lower volumes sold 
the operating income of the florida propane operation increased by  in margins increased  but were partially offset by an increase of  in operating expenses 
advanced information services the advanced information services segment provides domestic and international clients with information technology related business services and solutions for both enterprise and e business applications

revenues continued to decline in  however  at a rate that was less than the revenue decline was more than offset by reduced operating costs  primarily payroll and benefits 
a non recurring sale of software contributed  to operating income in during  this segment was adversely affected by the nation s economic slowdown as discretionary consulting projects were postponed or cancelled 
lower revenues in were partially offset by reductions in the cost of sales and in operating expenses  principally sales and marketing

critical accounting policies chesapeake s reported financial condition and results of operations are affected by the accounting methods  assumptions and estimates that are used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
however  because most of chesapeake s businesses are regulated  the accounting methods used by chesapeake must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  therefore  the choices available are  in many cases  limited by these regulatory requirements 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies have been discussed with the audit committee of chesapeake 
regulatory assets and liabilities chesapeake records certain assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
at december   chesapeake had recorded regulatory assets of million  including  for underrecovered purchased gas costs and  for environmental costs 
the company has recorded regulatory liabilities for accrued asset removal cost and self insurance of million and million  respectively  at december  if the company were required to terminate application of sfas no 
 it would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  chesapeake no longer amortizes goodwill 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment 
the initial test was performed upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   and again at the end of and these tests were based on subjective measurements  including discounted cash flows of expected future operating results and market valuations of similar businesses 
those tests indicated that the goodwill associated with the water business was impaired and charges totaling million pre tax were recorded in at december   no goodwill remained related to the water companies 
goodwill is tested annually and when events change 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in note n to the financial statements  chesapeake has completed its responsibilities related to one environmental site and is currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of three other former gas manufacturing plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts because the environmental protection agency epa or state authority may not have selected the final remediation methods 
additionally  there is uncertainty due to the outcome of legal remedies sought from other potentially responsible parties 
at december   chesapeake had recorded environmental regulatory assets of  and a liability for environmental costs of  propane wholesale marketing contracts chesapeake s propane wholesale marketing operation enters into forward and futures contracts that are considered derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with the pronouncement  open positions are marked to market prices at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the contracts all mature within one year  and are almost exclusively for propane commodities with delivery points of mt 
belvieu  texas and hattiesburg  mississippi 
management estimates the market valuation based on reference to exchange traded futures prices  historical differentials and actual trading activity at the end of the reporting period 
at december  and  these contracts had net unrealized gains of  and  respectively 
operating revenues revenues for the natural gas distribution operations of the company are based on rates approved by the various public service commissions 
the natural gas transmission operation revenues are based on rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
however  the regulatory authorities have granted the company s regulated natural gas distribution operations the ability to negotiate rates with customers that have competitive alternatives using approved methodologies 
in addition  the natural gas transmission operations can negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved tariff rates 
chesapeake s natural gas distribution operations each have a gas cost recovery mechanism that provides for the adjustment of rates charged to customers as gas costs fluctuate 
these amounts are collected or refunded through adjustments to rates in subsequent periods 
the company charges flexible rates to the natural gas distribution s industrial interruptible customers to make them competitive with alternative types of fuel 
based on pricing  these customers can choose natural gas or alternative types of supply 
neither the company nor the interruptible customer is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas 
in chesapeake changed the revenue recognition method for its delaware and maryland natural gas distribution divisions to conform to its florida division 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the propane marketing operation records trading activity net  on a mark to market basis for open contracts 
the propane distribution  advanced information services and other segments record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
regulatory activities the company s natural gas distribution operations are subject to regulation by the delaware  maryland and florida public service commissions 
the natural gas transmission operation is subject to regulation by the ferc 
on august   the delaware division filed a general rate increase application with the delaware public service commission psc 
interim rates  subject to refund  went into effect on october  the psc approved a settlement agreement for phase i of the rate increase application in april phase i resulted in an increase in rates of approximately  per year 
phase ii of the filing was approved by the delaware psc in november it resulted in an additional increase in rates of approximately  phase ii also reduces the company s sensitivity to weather by changing the minimum customer charge and the margin sharing arrangement for interruptible sales  off system sales and capacity release income 
on october   eastern shore filed a rate change with the ferc pursuant to the requirements of the stipulation and agreement dated august  following settlement conferences held in may  the parties reached a settlement in principle on or about may   to resolve all issues related to its rate case 
the offer of settlement and the stipulation and agreement were finalized and filed with the ferc on august  the agreement provided for a reduction in rates of approximately  on an annual basis 
on october   the ferc issued an order approving the offer of settlement and the stipulation and agreement 
settlement rates went into effect on december  during october  eastern shore filed for recovery of gas supply realignment costs associated with the implementation of ferc order no 
the costs totaled  including interest 
at that time  the ferc would not review eastern shore s filing  because the ferc wished to settle a related matter with another transmission company first 
the other transmission company submitted a filing on december  the ferc has not yet acted on the filing 
eastern shore will resubmit its transition cost recovery filing immediately upon learning of ferc s approval 
on december   eastern shore filed revised tariff sheets to implement revisions to its fuel retention and cash out provisions 
these became effective january  the proposed tariff revisions permit eastern shore to incorporate its deferred gas required for operations amounts into the calculation of its annual fuel retention percentage adjustment and to implement a surcharge  effective july of each year  to recover cash out amounts 
the ferc accepted eastern shore s revised tariff sheets on january   subject to certain revisions to clarify the tariff sheets 
on january   eastern shore submitted the revised tariff sheets 
on march   the florida division filed tariff revisions with the florida psc to complete the unbundling process by requiring all customers  including residential  to migrate to transportation service and authorized the florida division to exit the merchant function 
transportation services were already available to all nonresidential customers 
on november   the florida psc approved the company s request for the first phase of the unbundling process as a pilot program for a minimum two year period 
the company has implemented the program 
as a part of this pilot program  the company submitted several filings during to address transition costs  the disposition of the unrecovered gas cost balances  the implementation of the operational balancing account and the level of base rates 
on july   the florida psc approved a rate restructuring proposed by chesapeake 
the restructuring created three new low volume rate classes  with customer charge levels that ensure that all customers receive benefits from the unbundling 
on january   the florida psc authorized the refund of the remaining balance in the pga account  totaling environmental matters the company has completed its responsibilities related to the dover gas light site and continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at three other environmental sites see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that future costs associated with these sites will be recoverable in rates or through sharing arrangements with  or contributions by  other responsible parties 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
long term debt is subject to potential losses based on the change in interest rates 
the company s long term debt consists of first mortgage bonds  senior notes and convertible debentures see note i to the consolidated financial statements for annual maturities of consolidated long term debt 
all of chesapeake s long term debt is fixed rate debt and was not entered into for trading purposes 
the carrying value of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  was million at december   as compared to a fair value of million  based mainly on current market prices or discounted cash flows using current rates for similar issues with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through its issuance of fixed rate long term debt 
the company evaluates whether to refinance existing debt or permanently finance existing short term borrowing based in part on the fluctuation in interest rates 
the company s propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
the company can store up to approximately four million gallons of propane including leased storage and rail cars during the winter season to meet its customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  the company has adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges of its inventory 
at december   the propane distribution operation had entered into contracts to hedge million gallons of propane inventory 
the propane wholesale marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids ngl forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane marketing operation purchase or sell ngl at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of ngl to the company or the counter party or booking out the transaction booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price 
the forward and futures contracts are entered into for trading and wholesale marketing purposes 
the propane wholesale marketing operation is subject to commodity price risk on its open positions to the extent that market prices for ngl deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
market risk associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with chesapeake s risk management policy  which includes volumetric limits for open positions 
to manage exposures to changing market prices  open positions are marked up or down to market prices and reviewed by oversight officials on a daily basis 
additionally  the risk management committee reviews periodic reports on market and credit risk  approves any exceptions to the risk management policy within the limits established by the board of directors and authorizes the use of any new types of contracts 
quantitative information on the forward and futures contracts at december  and is shown in the following chart

 estimated market prices and weighted average contract prices are in dollars per gallon 
all contracts expire in the company s natural gas distribution operations have entered into agreements with natural gas suppliers to purchase natural gas for resale to their customers 
purchases under these contracts are considered normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
and are not marked to market 
competition the company s natural gas operations compete with other forms of energy including electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price  and to a lesser extent  accessibility 
the company s natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that have the capacity to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements 
lower levels in interruptible sales occur when oil prices are lower relative to the price of natural gas 
oil prices  as well as the prices of electricity and other fuels are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  the company uses flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales side of its business to maximize sales volumes 
as a result of the transmission business conversion to open access  this business has shifted from providing competitive sales service to providing transportation and contract storage services 
the company s natural gas distribution operations located in delaware  maryland and florida offer transportation services to certain industrial customers 
in  the florida operation extended transportation service to commercial customers and  in  to residential customers 
with transportation service now available on the company s distribution systems  the company is competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
as it relates to transportation services  the company s competitors include the interstate transmission company if the distribution customer is located close enough to the transmission company s pipeline to make a connection economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass the distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  the distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
the company expects to continue to expand the availability of transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
the company established a natural gas sales and supply operation in florida in to compete for customers eligible for transportation services 
the company s propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their service territories  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing reliability of service and responsiveness 
competition is generally from local outlets of national distribution companies and local businesses  because distributors located in close proximity to customers incur lower costs of providing service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas serviced by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
the advanced information services business faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does the company 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly  which could adversely impact the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price 
inflation inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
fluctuations in natural gas prices are passed on to customers through the gas cost recovery mechanism in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from regulatory commissions for regulated operations while monitoring the returns of its unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  chesapeake adjusts its propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market
