executive summary company description 
we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices to restore spinal anatomy using minimally invasive technology 
our devices are used primarily by surgeons who repair compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis and cancer 
our first commercial products  comprising our kyphx instruments  utilize our proprietary balloon technology 
surgeons use these instruments to help repair fractures during minimally invasive spine surgeries 
most alternative spine fracture treatments are either highly invasive or are pain management therapies 

table of contents our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in sunnyvale  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research  regulatory and administrative activities 
outside the us  we operate sales  clinical and administrative facilities in brussels  belgium  research and biomaterial manufacturing facilities in rosbach  germany and we have direct selling operations in the major countries in europe 
our global distribution network consists of a direct sales force in excess of individuals who market our products to physicians  surgeons and hospitals 
in recent history  we have had several significant developments  including the following in may  we commercially launched our kyphx product line to repair vertebral compression fractures of the spine caused primarily by osteoporosis 
on may   we completed our initial public offering ipo  issuing  shares of voting common stock at per share 
the net proceeds of the ipo were million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs 
in august  we entered into a patent license agreement with bonutti research inc for exclusive rights  now totaling listed us patents related to claimed inventions including expandable balloons and related products for use in the spine and non exclusive rights in other areas 
in february  we purchased sanatis for a total of million 
sanatis is a developer and manufacturer of orthopedic biomaterials in rosbach  germany 
principle products and significant business trends 
our net sales include sales of our kyphx instruments consisting of our kyphx inflatable bone tamps  kyphx inflation syringe  kyphx bone access systems  kyphx bone filler device  and our kyphx bone biopsy device 
during  our business experienced significant growth 
net sales in increased to million  compared to million in  representing growth of 
we introduced new products during  including our own biomaterials  kyphx hv r and kyphos  in europe 
many of the new products were variations of the existing products  and included additional sizes and or balloon configurations that give surgeons more options during the procedure 
we trained approximately  physicians during in the unites states and europe 
in the us alone  we added approximately new hospitals to our customer base 
we also initiated a program whereby additional spine education specialists were hired with a primary role of educating referring physicians about surgical options to treating patients with vertebral compression fractures 
in the fourth quarter of  we submitted a k application to the fda for our proprietary bone cement  kyphx hv r 
in addition  we received ce mark approval in europe for our calcium phosphate bone filler material  kyphos 
we believe this new biomaterial will allow us to address a portion of the overall traumatic vertebral compression market in europe and we will initiate some trial cases early in also in europe during  we began a randomized clinical trial of kyphoplasty with kyphx hv r compared to conservative therapy with primarily bracing  bed rest and pain medication 
we expect to continue to enroll patients into this trial during in  we experienced our first year of overall profitability  as we leveraged our sales growth while continuing to make investments in our product development  sales and marketing areas 
as of december   however  we still had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
expanded activities related to the continued commercialization of our kyphx instruments  enhanced physician reimbursement and increased product offerings  together with our general and administrative efforts will continue to cause our expenses to increase 
as we proceed with commercialization  we will require additional sales and marketing resources  data from proposed clinical and marketing studies and greater physician reimbursement acceptance by payors 
in  we expect continued aggressive growth across our organization to support our expanding business 
managing that growth will be important to maintaining and increasing our profitability 
we also intend to invest significantly in our foreign operations to continue our geographic expansion 

table of contents as we have previously announced  we presently anticipate moving our us headquarters around the end of the first quarter of from our present location in sunnyvale  california to another location about a mile away 
we have already terminated our present lease on our current facilities in advance of this move  taking a million charge included in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of we must vacate our present buildings no later than may we have had several recent encouraging developments related to reimbursement for our products 
first  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms icd coordination and maintenance committee issued and published a recommendation for a specific icd code for the kyphoplasty procedure 
this icd code became effective in october and officially recognizes kyphoplasty as a procedure by cms 
there was also progress in surgeon reimbursement during the year  and policy and or bulletin coverage is now established in states  with the remaining states providing coverage on a case by case basis 
the private pay community has also shown significant interest in establishing reimbursement policies for kyphoplasty 
specifically  blue cross blue shield has now adopted policy coverage for kyphoplasty in states  and a number of private payors nationwide have also adopted policy coverage 
on a national level  the healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs national editorial panel established two new hcpcs s codes for kyphoplasty effective january  these s codes are intended for use by private payors  such as the blue cross blue shield association and the health insurance association of america  although no payment level is associated with these codes 
in addition  in europe  kyphoplasty was assigned a code in the newly implemented german drg system 
there are many private payors that continue to perceive the procedure which uses our products as experimental 
another challenge we face is to achieve consistent and or increased payment levels among the different insurers 
we frequently evaluate potential opportunities for growth in our business by evaluating external products or technologies 
while our ultimate focus will remain on our core business and the large opportunities the osteoporosis  cancer and trauma vertebral fracture markets present  we may choose to pursue one or more business development opportunities 
these efforts may require us to seek additional funding and may be dilutive to our earnings 
significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive government regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success is dependent on our ability to compete successfully against our competitors 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in the factors affecting future operating results section of our md a 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales years ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales amount of net sales us sales international sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other and interest income expense  net net income loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to the increases in net sales resulted from an increase in the number of trained physicians as well as an increase in the number of procedures performed by these trained physicians 
the increase in international sales also reflected the currency impact of million in as the euro exchange rate continued to strengthen against the us dollar 
no customer accounted for more than of total net sales in  and as of december   we had trained approximately  surgeons in the us and approximately surgeons in europe 
we believe the total number of potential physicians who can be trained for the use of our products is approximately  to  in the us the number of trainable physicians in europe is less well defined at this time  but we believe them to be more than  cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of material  labor  subcontract  and overhead costs 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to however  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales continue to decrease primarily as a result of fixed overhead costs being spread over increased production volume 
the absolute increase in cost of goods sold over the years from to resulted primarily from increased material  labor  subcontract  overhead costs and inventory provisions in relation to the increased sales volume of our products 
our cost of goods sold and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of costs of product research  product development  regulatory and clinical functions and personnel 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased research and development consulting fees of  increased product testing and development expenditures of  and increased basic and applied research funding of  the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  and increased product testing and development expenditures of  we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses in will increase in absolute dollars 
as a percentage of net sales  we anticipate our research and development expenses to be in the range of to for 
table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of costs for personnel  physician training programs and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in compared to sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from related primarily to a million increase in the costs of hiring  training and compensating additional direct selling representatives  increased expenditures related to advertising  promotion  trade shows and market research activities of million  increased sales travel expenses of million  and increased consulting expenses of million 
the increase in from related primarily to a million increase in the costs of hiring  training and compensating additional direct selling representatives  increased expenditures related to advertising  promotion  trade shows and market research activities of million  increased sales travel expenses of million  and increased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million 
as we continue to commercialize our kyphx instruments during  we expect to significantly increase our sales and marketing efforts and expenditures in absolute dollars while reducing our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales to between to for the year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs  professional service fees  expenses related to intellectual property rights and general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from resulted primarily from increased personnel costs of million  increased office expenses of  increased licenses and insurance expenditures of  increased travel and entertainment expenses of  and facility expense of million due to the termination of the current lease as a result of our decision to move to a larger new facility 
the increases in expenses were offset partially by decreased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  the increase in from resulted primarily from increased personnel costs of million  including  in accrued severance cost  increased miscellaneous taxes  licenses and insurance expenditures of million and increased legal  public company expenses  accounting and consulting fees of  offset partially by decreased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we add personnel  continue to expand our patent portfolio and incur public reporting  governmental compliance and investor related expenses as a public company 
therefore  we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure 
however  as a percentage of net sales  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly during purchased in process research and development 
in february  we purchased sanatis gmbh sanatis  for approximately million in cash and acquisition costs of  sanatis is a privately held developer and manufacturer of orthopedic biomaterials based in rosbach  germany 
the acquisition was made to add sanatis experience developing and manufacturing orthopedic biomaterials and to complement our existing patent portfolio with sanatis intellectual property surrounding calcium based biomaterials and delivery technologies 
the impact to our financial operating results during was an increase in research and development expenses of approximately  we have recorded the transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded an expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of  and capitalized net tangible assets of  intangible assets of  and goodwill of  we are amortizing the intangible assets on a straight line basis over a five year period 
no amortization of goodwill has been recorded 
instead  we will perform an assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test annually  or more frequently  if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
in august  we entered into a patent license agreement with bonutti research inc for the rights to a series of patents  now numbering  issued to dr 
peter bonutti and other related patent rights and applications defined in the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the exclusive right to develop any of the claimed inventions  including expandable balloons and related products  for use within 
table of contents bone  and for use within joints  ligaments  tendons  or cartilage in the spine and the co exclusive right to develop any of the claimed inventions  including expandable balloons and related products  for orthopedic use in treating or diagnosing injuries of the joints  ligaments  cartilage  nerves or tendons outside of the spine 
we paid million in cash for the rights  all of which was immediately expensed to purchased in process research and development 
the acquisition cost was immediately expensed to operations as the technology acquired may be used to develop products that have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities  and the in process projects to which the patents may apply had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
other and interest income expense  net 
other and interest income expense  net  increased million in compared to other and interest income expense  net  decreased million in compared to the increase in from resulted from interest income from higher cash  cash equivalent and investment balances resulting from proceeds of our initial public offering as well as decreased interest expense from repaid convertible promissory notes 
the decrease in from included non cash interest expense of million related to the beneficial conversion feature and the fair value of warrants issued in connection with the convertible promissory notes 
in addition  increased interest expense resulted from outstanding convertible promissory notes offset partially by increased interest income from higher cash  cash equivalent and investments balances resulting from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes of million for fiscal resulted primarily from a current tax provision of million offset by the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of as compared to zero in prior years 
historically  we have established deferred tax assets arising from federal and states net operating loss carryforwards  federal and state tax credit carryforwards as well as from other timing differences 
these deferred tax assets have been offset in total by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
the release of the valuation allowance and the resulting recognition of a deferred tax benefit in the year was based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
we believe that in our tax rate will be approximately  even though the actual amount of taxes paid may be reduced by net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to stock option activities 
at december   we had approximately million and million in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce future taxable income 
the federal and state carryforwards have expiration dates beginning in and  respectively  in each case if not utilized 
at december   we had tax credits carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
ownership changes  as defined  occurred on august   december  and may  in accordance with internal revenue code section  utilization of the carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation is not expected to result in the expiration of net operating losses prior to utilization 
deferred stock based compensation we recorded deferred stock based compensation for financial reporting purposes as the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of grant 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized to cost of goods sold  research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense 
deferred stock based compensation recorded through december  was million  with accumulated amortization of million 
the remaining million will be amortized over the vesting periods of the options  generally four years from the date of grant 
all option amounts are being amortized using a 
table of contents straight line method 
we expect to record amortization expense for deferred stock based compensation as follows year amount million million million stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized as the stock options are earned 
the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to non employees  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million through december   of which million has been amortized to expense as of december  seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in the first and second quarters 
we traditionally experience somewhat lower sales volumes in the third quarter months than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule during the summer months  and during the fourth quarter  our us revenues reflect generally the reduced number of selling days due to the holiday season 
liquidity and capital resources in may  we received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering of common stock 
from inception through june  we raised million through private sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments short and long term  and working capital of million 
cash provided by used in operating activities 
our operating cash flow in was primarily the result of our operational profitability 
cash flow from our increased sales and management of our operating activities more than offset increased working capital needs primarily for accounts receivables 
net cash provided by operations was approximately million in attributable primarily to net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges related to amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  increases in accrued liabilities of million and accounts payable of million as we accrued for income taxes and increased our operating expenses offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million and increases in accounts receivable of million as we increased our net sales 
our net cash flow from operations in reflected a near balance of operational cash inflow versus growing working capital needs 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in attributable primarily to the add back of million write off of in process research and development charge  non cash charges related to million amortization of deferred stock based compensation  and million of non cash interest expense offset partially by net loss of million  and increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to increased sales 
in  we increased our operating expenditures reflecting our commitment to building our sales and marketing activities  which resulted in a net operating cash outflow 
cash used in operations was million in attributable primarily to net losses of million after adjustment for non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  and increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million 
these increases in use of cash in operations were offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment for all periods 
during  cash used for investing activities reflected the net purchases of investments of million  and payment of million in connection with the sanatis acquisition 
during  cash used for investing activities reflected the purchases of investments of million and payment of million in connection with the patent sublicense agreement 
we plan to increase our purchases of property and equipment due to the outfitting of our new sunnyvale facility in 
table of contents cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided during was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million  exercise of stock options of million and repayment of related party notes receivable of million 
cash provided during was attributable primarily from proceeds of million from issuing common stock in our initial public offering partially offset by repayment of convertible promissory notes of million 
cash provided during was primarily from the proceeds of convertible promissory notes 
facility lease termination 
in december  we entered into a lease termination agreement to terminate the existing facility lease in may which was due to expire in march the lease termination charge of million was recorded in december as a general and administrative expense 
the amortization of the remaining leasehold improvements in the current facility is being accelerated to be fully amortized by march  contractual cash obligations 
at december  we had contractual cash obligations as follows payment due by periods total after operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent aggregate future minimum lease payments under noncancellable facility leases 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the aggregate minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  as well as in the table above 
our purchase obligations relate to the construction and remodeling of our new facility 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on kyphon and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
stock repurchase 
the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program on november  pursuant to which up to  shares of our outstanding common stock may be repurchased 
the 
table of contents duration of the repurchase program is open ended 
under the program  we may purchase shares of common stock through open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management 
the purchases will be funded from available working capital 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares pursuant to this repurchase program 
summary 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if existing cash  cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or for other reasons related to our business  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock  and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 
we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in manufacturing  infrastructure and personnel as well as revisions and upgrades to our new facility 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest to address new markets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the fasb published the revision to clarify and amend some of the original provisions of fin  which was issued in january  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
a variable interest entity vie refers to an entity subject to consolidation according to the provisions of this interpretation 
fin r applies to entities whose equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including equity holders  or where the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest 
fin r provides that if an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie  the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of the vie should be consolidated in the entity s financial statements 
in addition  fin r requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie provide additional disclosures 
the provisions of fin r are effective for our fiscal first quarter 
we do not expect the adoption of fin r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial policies and estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee and our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
those financial policies and estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products to customers and distributors 
revenue from product sales  net of discounts  is recognized upon receipt of a valid purchase order  shipment of the products and when collection of the receivables is deemed probable 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable has been less than of net sales for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively  at december  and excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to increase the provision needed for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was  and  at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had provided a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
in the fourth quarter of  we released our valuation allowance because based upon our recurring level of profitability  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 

table of contents as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our management estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
purchase accounting 
purchase accounting requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets  and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
purchased in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased in process research and development and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for purchased in process research and development  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
impairment of long lived assets 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or in the case of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis for goodwill 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
factors affecting future operating results unless we obtain additional regulatory approvals or clearances  we will not be able to promote the use of our instruments in specific surgical procedures or the benefits of any surgical procedures including procedures involving bone cement using our instruments in the united states  and our ability to grow our business could be significantly harmed 
in october  we received a warning letter from the fda challenging the promotional claims that we were making for our kyphx instruments 
the fda said that our regulatory clearance for the kyphx inflatable bone tamp did not permit us to promote the product for use in any specific sites in the body  or for any specific surgical procedures  including for kyphoplasty 
the fda also stated that we could not promote any clinical benefits of surgical procedures using our instruments until we obtained additional regulatory approvals related to the benefits 
after discussions and correspondence with the fda  we agreed to abide by these restrictions and revised our promotional campaign accordingly 
subsequently  we obtained our current k clearance to promote the kyphx inflatable bone tamp as a conventional bone tamp in the reduction of fracture and or creation of a void in cancellous bone in the spine  hand  tibia  radius and calcaneus 
in order to promote the use of our devices for specific procedures and with certain resultant patient benefits  we must obtain further market clearances or approvals  which may require additional clinical data to be generated to support such clearance or approval 
if such an application or applications are filed  we can provide no assurance that they will be approved in a timely fashion  if at all 
if we fail to obtain these additional regulatory approvals  our ability to generate revenues may be harmed 

table of contents if regulatory authorities find that bone cement should not be used in the spine  our ability to sell and promote our instruments would be harmed  and our exposure to product liability litigation could increase 
in october  the fda published a public health web notification entitled complications related to the use of bone cement in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures 
in april the fda published an update to the original notification entitled complications related to the use of bone cement in treating compression fractures of the spine 
the updated notification states that reported complications related to the use of polymethylmethacrylate bone cements to treat compression fractures of the spine  such as soft tissue damage and nerve root pain and compression  have resulted from leakage of bone cement  and that other complications including pulmonary embolism  respiratory and cardiac failure  abdominal intrusions ileus and death have been reported 
the notification is subject to potential future revision at the sole discretion of the fda 
the content of any further revised notification cannot be predicted 
the notification indicates that the fda is working with appropriate professional organizations and manufacturers of orthopedic devices to develop a basis for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of bone cements used to treat compression fractures of the spine 
the notification requests that the healthcare community follow established procedures for reporting of deaths or serious injuries resulting from the use of medical devices  including bone cement 
in july  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra of the united kingdom issued a medical device alert entitled  injectable polymeric cements in percutaneous vertebroplasty  balloon kyphoplasty and pedicle screw augmentation procedures 
the uk mhra has received reports of bone cement leaking during vertebroplasty and pedicle screw augmentation procedures leading to patient complications 
the alert noted that there have been no complications reported to mhra from balloon kyphoplasty procedures  but stated that it was including balloon kyphoplasty procedures in the alert due to similarities the mhra perceived exist between balloon kyphoplasty procedures and the other procedures it identified in its alert 
we believe the mhra s alert concerning balloon kyphoplasty pertains directly to our kyphx products  since our products are the only balloons used in europe to perform kyphoplasty 
the notification asks physicians to consider alternatives before performing procedures using bone cement in the spine  to use the manufacturer s instructions in preparing bone cements for use in the spine  and to take specific precautions before and during those procedures 
these notifications themselves may raise concerns with our customers  potential customers and reimbursement organizations  which could negatively impact our ability to sell and promote our instruments 
an increase in reports of deaths or serious injuries could lead the fda or foreign regulatory agencies to issue safety alerts  health advisories  or mandated labeling changes restricting use of our instruments  including new warnings regarding their use or contraindicating their use with bone cement 
in addition  since use of our products in the spine necessarily causes a surgeon to use a bone void filler of choice  typically bone cement  in the spine to fill the voids created by our products  increased reporting of adverse events would expose us to increased risk of product liability litigation  and our current insurance coverage limits may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the united states  we are not permitted to promote  or train physicians in  the use of our kyphx instruments with bone cement in the spine 
as the fda s position is that we may not train physicians about specific procedures in the spine  we limit our training and education of physicians to the specialized skills involved in the proper use of our instruments 
although physicians may use our instruments with bone filler material of their choice  including bone cement  the fda has taken the position that we cannot promote the use of bone cement  or train surgeons to use bone cement with our instruments unless bone cement is specifically approved for use in the spine 
we instruct our trainers  both physician faculty consultants and employees  not to discuss the use of any bone filler material  including bone cement  with our instruments 
however  they may respond to unsolicited questions about bone cement that are raised by physician participants during a training 
table of contents program 
although we believe our training methods are proper  if the fda determines that our training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use  they can request that we modify our training or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalty 
if we are unable to obtain us regulatory approval to market the use of our bone cement for use with our instruments in spine fracture surgery or to document resulting benefits  our future competitive position and revenue may be harmed 
in december  we submitted a k application for clearance of our bone cement as a bone void filler material in a specific minimally invasive spine procedure known as kyphoplasty 
if we fail to receive k clearance  or as part of the clearance process  we may be required to conduct clinical studies to support our fda submission s 
there are many risks associated with conducting the clinical study  including our ability to obtain fda approval of our study protocol  enroll patients  avoid adverse study outcomes  and demonstrate safety and effectiveness 
any of these factors could delay  limit or prevent our successful completion of a clinical study and or our regulatory approval 
if we are unable to obtain clearance or fda approval of our bone cement for use in spine surgery  our future competitive position and revenues may be harmed 
if we are unable to demonstrate to regulatory authorities  such as the fda  the benefits we believe result from the use of our products  we will be unable to effectively promote the benefits of our products and the medical community may fail to adopt our products as the treatment method of choice for vertebral compression fractures  which could harm our future competitive position and our revenue stream 
vertebral compression fractures in the past have been treated with a variety of measures  including vertebroplasty  which involves the high pressure introduction of bone cement or other bone filler material into the spine without creation of a void in the bone to accept the cement and without attempting to reduce the fracture before use of the cement 
many in the medical community are not yet persuaded  and may never be persuaded  that the additional steps of creating a void in the vertebral bodies and or reducing the compression fracture with our products provide any further patient benefits over those already offered by vertebroplasty  or that any additional benefits associated with spinal deformity correction are worth the additional cost of our instruments 
if we are unable to demonstrate that real benefits result from procedures using our products to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  including the fda  we will be unable to promote any of these benefits  and the medical community may not widely adopt use of our products  or may entirely reject using our products to perform surgery  which would harm our business and our revenues and could significantly affect our growth 
our failure to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals could hurt our ability to commercially distribute and market our kyphx instruments 
our kyphx instruments are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and in foreign countries where we intend to do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must first receive either k clearance or premarket approval from the fda 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but may take longer 
the premarket approval process generally takes from one to three years from the time the application is filed with the fda  but it can be longer and can be significantly more expensive than the k clearance process 
although we have obtained k clearance for the kyphx inflatable bone tamp for fracture reduction in specific sites including the spine  hand  tibia  radius and calcaneus  our k clearance can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
we also may be required to obtain k clearance or premarket approval to market additional instruments and will be required to 
table of contents obtain additional clearances approvals for new indications for our kyphx instruments 
before we can market any bone cement product for use in spine surgery  we must first obtain regulatory clearance 
we cannot be certain that we would obtain any further k clearances or premarket approvals in a timely manner or at all 
delays in obtaining clearances or approvals may adversely affect our revenue and future profitability 
modifications to our marketed devices may require new k clearances or premarket approvals or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until clearances are obtained 
any modification to a k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any manufacturer s decision 
we have modified aspects of our kyphx instruments without seeking new k clearances 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions not to seek new clearances or approvals 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any of these modifications to a previously cleared instrument  we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain clearance or approval  and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
if we fail to comply with quality system regulations  our manufacturing operations could be delayed  and our product sales and profitability could suffer 
our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  which cover the procedures and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our instruments 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections 
if we fail a quality system inspection  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed 
failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse quality system inspection could force a shut down of our manufacturing operations and or a recall of our instruments  which would cause our instrument sales and business to suffer 
if reimbursement for the procedures using our instruments becomes difficult to obtain or is not available in sufficient amounts  our instruments may not be widely adopted 
in a small number of cases  physicians performing a procedure using our instruments have not been reimbursed 
continued adoption of our instruments by the medical community may be adversely impacted if physicians do not receive sufficient reimbursement from payors for their services in performing the procedures using our instruments 
currently  there is no specific procedure code under which reimbursement to physicians is available for procedures performed using our kyphx instruments 
physicians must report procedures using our instruments under an unlisted current procedural terminology  or cpt  code  and hospitals receive reimbursement for an inpatient stay 
physicians have obtained reimbursement from medicare for the use of our products in all states and in the district of columbia 
however  physicians in some states believe that the level of reimbursement we have achieved thus far is too low 
until a specific national cpt code is granted  physician reimbursement from medicare may be harder to obtain in some states 
to date  no application for a national cpt code has been filed and none may be filed for one or more years 
in addition  the absence of fda approval specifically allowing us to promote the use of bone cement in the spine may affect the availability of reimbursement for spine surgeries in which our instruments are used 
future regulatory action by a government agency  including the adoption of a national cpt code or negative clinical results may diminish reimbursement coverage for both the physician and hospital 
finally  reimbursement differs from state to state  and some states may not reimburse for a procedure in an adequate amount 
if physicians are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for procedures in which our kyphx instruments are used  we may be unable to sell our instruments and our business could suffer 

table of contents adverse changes in reimbursement procedures by domestic and international payors may impact our ability to market and sell our instruments 
even if the use of our instruments is reimbursed by private payors and medicare  adverse changes in payors policies toward reimbursement for the procedure would harm our ability to market and sell our instruments 
we are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by payors 
we cannot be certain that under prospective payment systems  such as those utilized by medicare  and in many managed care systems used by private health care payors  the cost of our instruments will be justified and incorporated into the overall cost of the procedure 
even if we fulfill international regulatory requirements to market our instruments  our success will be partly dependent upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
in addition  health care cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the united states are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our instruments  and these efforts are expected to continue 
although we intend to seek international reimbursement approvals  we may not obtain approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
because injuries that occur during spine surgery can be significant  we are subject to an increased risk of product liability lawsuits 
if we are sued in a product liability action  we could be forced to pay substantial damages 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in spine surgery procedures 
spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications  including bleeding  nerve injury  paralysis and death 
use of bone filler material by surgeons to fill the void created using our kyphx inflatable bone tamp may also lead to these complications  as a result of leakage of the bone filler material into the spinal canal or surrounding tissue 
consequently  companies that produce instruments for use in the spine are subject to a significant risk of product liability litigation 
if our instruments are found to have caused or contributed to any injury  we could be held liable for substantial damages  and our current product liability coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur 
in addition  we may require increased product liability coverage if sales of our instruments increase 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
our reliance on suppliers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget 
we are dependent upon outside suppliers to provide us with our kyphx inflation syringe  as well as other key components necessary for the manufacture of our products 
in addition  we are presently sourcing our kyphx inflation syringe from a single supplier  without any present viable alternative supplier identified 
generally  since we obtain components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and do not maintain large volumes of inventory  a product recall  disruption or termination of the supply of components could lead to a significant increase in manufacturing costs associated with the need to obtain replacement components  our inability to meet demand for our instruments  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation  and delays associated with regulatory qualifications required for use of replacement suppliers 
any one of these results could harm our sales and profits and make it difficult to meet our business goals 

table of contents if we do not effectively manage our growth  our existing infrastructure may become strained  and we will be unable to increase sales of our kyphx instruments or generate significant revenue growth 
our world wide direct sales organization has increased from employees in october to over employees in december  which we believe represents very significant growth over a relatively short period of time 
the growth that we have experienced  and in the future may experience  provides challenges to our organization  requiring us to rapidly expand our personnel and manufacturing operations 
we may not be able to hire sufficient personnel to meet our growth goals or may have difficulty managing such rapid growth 
as a result  our failure to recruit additional sales personnel may result in our inability to meet our projections 
future growth may strain our infrastructure  operations  product development and other managerial and operating resources 
if our business resources become strained  we may not be able to deliver instruments in a timely manner 
because we face significant competition from other medical device companies with greater resources than we have  we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and sales of our instruments may decline 
the market for medical devices is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
while the direct competition we have faced to date has been limited  we are aware that several companies are developing and already introducing products to directly compete with ours in similar procedures 
some of these potential competitors products may be successful in our market as a result of greater efficacy  less expensive alternatives to our products  or some other advantage that makes their products more attractive than ours  which could significantly impact our anticipated revenues and future growth 
our industry also includes large pharmaceutical companies that are developing drug products that may reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and cancer and  therefore  the market for our instruments 
our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological change and user preference through the development and introduction of new products that are of high quality and that address patient and surgeon requirements 
we compete with many larger companies that enjoy several competitive advantages  including longer standing distribution networks  and relationships with health care providers and payors  additional lines of products  and the ability to bundle products to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage  and greater resources for product development  sales and marketing and patent litigation 
at any time  other companies may develop additional competitive products 
if we are unable to compete effectively against existing or future competitors  sales of our instruments will decline 
if we are unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property  our ability to compete in the market will be harmed 
we believe that the proprietary technology embodied in our instruments and methods gives us a competitive advantage 
maintaining this competitive advantage is important to our future success 
we rely on patent protection in the us and abroad  as well as on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
our two earliest patents  which we believe provide broad protection to our technology but which are so far untested  expire no later than february our patent applications may not issue as patents at all or in a form that will be advantageous to us 
we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants  vendors  former employees and current employees  despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and may permit others to copy our products without effective recourse 
if our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected  we may be unable to 
table of contents keep other companies from competing directly with us  which could result in a decrease in our market share 
if we decide to enforce our intellectual property rights to prevent or inhibit appropriation of our technology by competitors  that process will be expensive and time consuming to litigate or otherwise dispose of and will divert management s attention from our core business 
our instruments could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may lead to costly litigation  payment of substantial damages or royalties and or our inability to use essential technologies 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
whether an instrument infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  the determination of which is often uncertain 
our competitors may assert that our instruments and methods infringe their patents 
from time to time  we may receive correspondence from various third parties accusing us of infringing their patents or inviting us to license their patents 
in addition  they may claim that their patents have priority over ours because their patents issued first 
because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware  which may later result in issued patents that our instruments or methods may infringe 
there could also be existing patents that one or more of our instruments or methods may inadvertently be infringing of which we are unaware 
as the number of competitors in the market for minimally invasive spine disorder treatments grow  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases 
infringement and other intellectual property claims  with or without merit  can be expensive and time consuming to litigate or otherwise dispose of and can divert management s attention from our core business 
in addition  if we lose an intellectual property litigation matter  a court could require us to pay substantial damages and or royalties and or issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would prohibit us from making  using and selling essential technologies unless we could design around the patents  which we may be unable to do 
also  although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights to bring an end to any claims or actions asserted or threatened against us  we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot design around a patent  are enjoined from infringing it  and cannot obtain a satisfactory license  we may be forced to cease selling our products  which would do substantial harm to our business 
we may initiate litigation to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights  in order to protect our rights or further determine the scope and validity of our intellectual property protection 
we may also begin one or more patent proceedings in various administrative agencies  such as the world s various patent offices  to protect our patent rights and prevent them from being undermined by our competitors patent filings 
these claims and proceedings could result in costly litigation and the diversion of management attention and resources away from our business and our proprietary rights may be damaged as a result if we do not prevail in any action we initiate  which may harm our ability to protect our business from competition 
in addition  our stock price may decline as a result of the impact of the litigation  including the financial impact of the cost of the litigation  announcements of intermediate results and rulings on various motions  and or the public s perception of the litigation progression 
since we depend upon distributors in some markets  if we lose a distributor or a distributor fails to perform  our operations will be harmed 
with the exception of the larger countries in europe and in canada  we sell our kyphx instruments in foreign markets through distributors 
to the extent we rely on distributors  our success will depend upon the efforts of others  over which we may have little control 
if we lose a distributor or a distributor fails to perform  our revenues will be harmed 

table of contents our non us sales present special risks 
sales outside of the united states account for a significant percentage of our revenues and we intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets 
non us sales are subject to a number of special risks 
for example our products may sell at lower prices outside the united states  agreements may be difficult to enforce  receivables may be difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  us export licenses may be difficult to obtain  intellectual property may be more difficult to acquire and enforce in foreign countries  terrorist activity may interrupt distribution channels or impact our customers or employees  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability  in us dollars  of products sold in foreign markets where payments are made in local currencies 
any of these events could harm our operations 
if we make acquisitions or divestitures  we could encounter difficulties that harm our business 
we may acquire companies  products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our business 
if we do so  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel  financials  operations  products or technologies 
acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share  disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses  which could harm our business 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  if these stockholders act together  they will be able to control our management and affairs in all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include a poison pill and other anti takeover provisions that enable our management to resist an unwelcome takeover attempt by a third party 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that enable our management to attempt to resist a takeover unless it is deemed by management and our board of directors to be in the best interests of our shareholders 
those provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management 
the existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  investments are generally held to maturity and the weighted average duration of our investments is months or less 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 

table of contents we have operated mainly in the united states  and   and of our sales were made in us dollars in   and  respectively 
to date  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the majority of our european sales is derived from european union countries and is denominated in euro 
monthly income and expense from our european operations are translated using average rates and balance sheets are translated using month end rates 
differences are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
