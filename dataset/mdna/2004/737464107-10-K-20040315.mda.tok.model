item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
operating subsidiaries in periods prior to december   the company provided third party asset management and leasing services for multifamily properties not operated under the post name through ram partners  inc ram 
additionally in prior periods  the company provided landscape installation and maintenance services to third parties through post landscape services  inc post landscape 
in the fourth quarter of  the net assets and operating businesses of ram and post landscape were sold to their respective management teams 
the company and the operating partnership no longer provide these services to unaffiliated third parties 
the sale of these entities reflected management s decision to focus its continuing efforts on its core business of owning  developing and managing post brand multifamily real estate assets and to do so with a smaller workforce and less overhead expenses

table of contents summary of investment and disposition activity during the five year period from january  through december   the company and its affiliates have developed and completed  apartment units in apartment communities  and sold apartment communities containing an aggregate of  apartment units 
the company did not acquire any apartment communities during the five year period from january  through december  the company and its affiliates have sold apartment communities after holding them for investment periods that generally ranged from seven to twelve years after acquisition or development 
the following table shows a summary of the company s development and sales activity during these periods 
units developed and completed units sold total units completed and owned by the company and its affiliates including units held for sale total rental revenues from continuing operations in thousands current development and lease up activity at december   the company had in initial lease up two new communities containing apartment units and had no communities under development 
the company s communities in initial lease up are summarized in the following table

this community was being developed as a joint venture company equity ownership is 
at december   the company had one project located in the washington dc area in the predevelopment stage 
the company expects to begin development and construction of the project in competition all of the company s apartment communities are located in developed markets that include other upscale apartments owned by numerous public and private companies 
some of these companies may have substantially greater resources and greater access to capital than the company  allowing them to grow at rates greater than the company 
the number of competitive upscale apartment properties and companies in a particular market could have a material effect on the company s ability to lease apartment units at its apartment communities or at any newly developed or acquired communities and on the rents charged 
in addition  other forms of residential post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents properties  including single family housing  condominiums and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of upscale apartment communities 
the company competes for residents based on its high level of resident service  the quality of its apartment communities including its landscaping and amenity offerings and the desirability of its locations 
resident leases at its apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
the company does not seek to compete solely on the basis of providing the low cost solution for all residents 
americans with disabilities act the company s apartment communities and any newly acquired apartment communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s apartment communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as apartment communities  to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company believes that its properties comply  in all material respects  with all present requirements under the ada and applicable state laws 
noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
if required to make material additional changes  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
environmental regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations that apply to the development of real property  including construction activities  the ownership of real property  and the operation of multifamily apartment communities 
the company has instituted a policy that requires an environmental investigation of each property that it considers for purchase or that it owns and plans to develop 
the environmental investigation is conducted by a qualified third party environmental consultant in accordance with recognized industry standards 
the environmental investigation report is reviewed by the company and counsel prior to purchase and or development of any property 
if the environmental investigation identifies evidence of potentially significant environmental contamination that merits additional investigation  sampling of the property is performed by the environmental consultant 
if necessary  remediation or migration of contamination  including removal of underground storage tanks  is undertaken either prior to development or at another appropriate time 
when performing remediation activities  the company is subject to a variety of environmental requirements 
in some cases  the company obtains state approval of the selected remediation measures by entering into voluntary environmental cleanup programs administered by state agencies 
in developing properties and constructing apartments  the company utilizes independent environmental consultants to determine whether there are any flood plains  wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas that are part of the property to be developed 
if flood plains are identified  development and construction work is planned so that flood plain areas are preserved or alternative flood plain capacity is created in conformance with federal and local flood plain management requirements 
if wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas are identified  the company plans and conducts its development and construction activities and obtains the necessary permits and authorizations in compliance with applicable legal standards 
in some cases  however  the presence of wetlands and or other environmentally sensitive areas could preclude  severely limit  or otherwise alter the proposed site development and construction activities 
storm water discharge from a construction site is subject to the storm water permit requirements mandated under the clean water act 
in most jurisdictions  the state administers the permit programs 
the company currently anticipates that it will be able to obtain and materially comply with any storm water permits required for new development 
the company has obtained and is in material compliance with the construction site storm water permits required for its existing development activities

cercla  and comparable state laws subject the owner or operator of real property or a facility to claims or liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances that are released at  in  on  under  or from real property or a facility 
in addition to claims for cleanup costs  the presence of hazardous substances on or the release of hazardous substances from a property or a facility and persons who arranged for off site disposal activities post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or property damage or could result in a claim from a governmental agency for other damages 
liability under cercla and comparable state laws can be imposed on the owner or the operator of real property or a facility without regard to fault or even knowledge of the release of hazardous substances and other regulated materials on  at  in  under  or from the property or facility 
environmental liabilities associated with hazardous substances also could be imposed on the company under other applicable environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state laws  or common law principles 
the presence of hazardous substances in amounts requiring response action or the failure to undertake necessary remediation may adversely affect the owner s ability to use or sell real estate or borrow money using such real estate as collateral 
various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the company s ongoing operation of the communities 
such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  management of surfaces with lead based paint and notices to residents about the lead based paint  use of active underground petroleum storage tanks  and waste management activities 
the failure to comply with such requirements could subject the company to a government enforcement action and or claims for damages by a private party 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  claim  or liability in connection with environmental conditions associated with any of its apartment communities 
the company has not been notified of a material claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party relating to any of its apartment communities in connection with environmental conditions 
the company is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its apartment communities that could be considered to be material 
it is possible  however  that the environmental investigations of our properties might not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities associated with the company s real property and its apartment communities or might have underestimated any potential environmental issues identified in the investigations 
it is also possible that future environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations or new interpretations of existing environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations will impose material environmental liabilities on the company  the current environmental conditions of properties that the company owns or operates will be affected adversely by hazardous substances associated with other nearby properties or the actions of third parties unrelated to the company  or our residents and or commercial tenants may engage in activities prohibited by their leases or otherwise expose the company to liability under applicable environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations 
the costs of defending any future environmental claims  performing any future environmental remediation  satisfying any such environmental liabilities  or responding to any changed environmental conditions could materially adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

table of contents risk factors the following risk factors apply to the company and the operating partnership 
all indebtedness described in the risk factors has been incurred by the operating partnership 
unfavorable changes in apartment markets and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates 
market and economic conditions in the various metropolitan areas of the united states where the company operates  particularly atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas and tampa  florida where a substantial majority of the company s apartment communities are located  may significantly affect occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore profitability 
factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following the economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in jobs  industry slowdowns and other factors  local conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  apartment homes  continued or worsened weak economic and market conditions that simultaneously affect one or more of the company s geographic markets  declines in household formation  favorable residential mortgage rates  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and competition from other available apartments and other housing alternatives and changes in market rental rates 
any of these factors could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve desired operating results from its communities 
development and construction risks could impact the company s profitability 
the company intends to continue to develop and construct apartment communities 
development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties 
the company s development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks the company may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  the company may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  and the company may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs  the company intends to concentrate its attention on fewer markets and reduce annual development expenditures  and it may abandon development opportunities that it has already begun to explore  and it may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring those opportunities  the company has been and may continue to be unable to complete construction and lease up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  the company may be unable to meet its profitability goals for that community  and land costs and construction costs have been increasing in the company s existing markets  and may continue to increase in the future and  in some cases  the costs of upgrading acquired communities have  and may continue to  exceed original estimates and the company may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for these increases in costs

table of contents members of the company s board of directors may have conflicts of interest because there could be adverse tax consequences upon the sale or refinancing of some of the operating partnership s apartment communities 
limited partners of the operating partnership may suffer different and more adverse tax consequences than the company upon the sale or refinancing of some of the operating partnership s apartment communities 
these limited partners  including two of the company s directors  may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale or refinancing of certain apartment communities 
one of these directors has announced that he will not stand for re election as a director at the company s next annual shareholder s meeting in may while the company  through wholly owned subsidiaries  has the exclusive authority as to whether and on what terms to sell or refinance any individual apartment community  these directors may influence the company not to sell or refinance these apartment communities  even though a sale might otherwise be financially advantageous to the company 
in addition  these directors could influence the company to refinance an apartment community with a high level of debt 
possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit the company s operational and financial flexibility 
purchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices for apartment communities that the company wishes to sell 
a weak market may limit the company s ability to change its portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions 
also  if the company is unable to sell apartment communities or if it can only sell apartment communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable  then the company may have to take on additional leverage in order to provide adequate capital to execute its development and construction and acquisitions strategy 
furthermore  a portion of the proceeds from the company s overall property sales in the future may be held in escrow accounts in order for some sales to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the company may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from property sales 
changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of the company s securities 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates 
therefore  if interest rates increase  the company s interest costs will rise to the extent its variable rate debt is not hedged effectively 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of the company s securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common and preferred stock and debt securities 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could affect the company s debt financing and create refinancing risk 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
although the company may be able to use cash flow to make future principal payments  it cannot assure investors that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy the distribution requirements that the company must satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following factors  among others  may affect the cash flows generated by the company s apartment communities the national and local economies  local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of apartment homes  the perceptions by prospective residents of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the company s communities and the neighborhoods in which they are located  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and rental expenses  including real estate taxes and utilities 
expenses associated with the company s investment in a community  such as debt service  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in cash flows from operations from that community 
if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to make the mortgage payments  the company could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagee 
the company is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that the company may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
as of december   the company had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of approximately  senior unsecured debt of approximately  and outstanding indebtedness under its lines of credit aggregating  the company could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increased risk of default and in an increase in its debt service requirements 
the company s board of directors has adopted a policy of limiting indebtedness to approximately of the undepreciated book value of its assets  but the company s organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness  funded or otherwise  that it might incur 
if this policy were changed  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect funds from operations  the company s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders and the operating partnership s ability to make expected distributions to its limited partners and in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and the operating partnership 
in addition  the company s and the operating partnership s ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in bank and other credit agreements 
the company manages its debt to be in compliance with its stated policy and with these debt covenants  but subject to compliance with these covenants  the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company s ability to service the additional debt 
accordingly  the company could become more leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on its obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  both of which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the company s shareholders 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts  or on favorable terms or at all 
if the company issues additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt  the interests of existing shareholders could be diluted 
acquired communities may not achieve anticipated results 
the company may selectively acquire apartment communities that meet its investment criteria 
the company s acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired community may fail to achieve expected occupancy and rental rates and may fail to perform as expected  the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  and the company s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate  causing the company to fail to meet its profitability goals 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
the company s apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes caused by declining mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership could adversely affect the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
limited investment opportunities could adversely affect the company s growth 
the company expects that other real estate investors will compete to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties 
these competitors include insurance companies  pension and investment funds  developer partnerships  investment companies and other apartment reits 
this competition could increase prices for properties of the type post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents that the company would likely pursue  and competitors may have greater resources than the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its growth 
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges 
from time to time when the company anticipates issuing debt securities  it may seek to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
the company may do this to increase the predictability of its financing costs 
also  from time to time  the company may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit its exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates 
if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of  or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than the company incurs under  a particular interest rate hedging contract  the contract is ineffective 
furthermore  the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 
these charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates 
despite the company s efforts to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company cannot guarantee that it will maintain coverage for all of its outstanding indebtedness at any particular time 
if the company does not effectively protect itself from this risk  it may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company s growth 
the company may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
the company s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and could decrease the value of the company s assets 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of the company s apartment communities could significantly affect the company s ability to operate those communities and thereby impair its ability to achieve the company s expected results 
further  the company s insurance coverage may not cover any losses caused by a terrorist attack 
in addition  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
finally  if the united states enters into and remains engaged in a wider armed conflict  the company s business and operating results could be adversely effected 
losses from natural catastrophes may exceed insurance coverage 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on its properties  which are believed to be of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets 
the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired in the future 
however  some losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as losses from floods or earthquakes  may be subject to limitations 
the company exercises discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on its investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms  however  the company may not be able to maintain its insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect it against potential losses 
further  the company s insurance costs could increase in future periods 
if the company suffers a substantial loss  its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed

table of contents potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
the company is in the business of owning  operating  developing  acquiring and  from time to time  selling real estate 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  as a current or former owner or operator  the company could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances  often regardless of its knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of its current or former ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the company could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
these costs could be substantial  and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment 
the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to the company s properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 
the americans with disabilities act  the fair housing act of and other federal  state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants 
these laws may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require the company to add other structural features that increase construction costs 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the company cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws  which may be substantial 
the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes depends upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon reits under the internal revenue code 
the company believes that it has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december   and plans to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a reit in the future 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the company cannot guarantee  therefore  that it has qualified or will continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that the company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within the company s control 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the company to remain qualified as a reit 
the company does not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its reit status 
if the company were to fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code did not apply  the company would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  leaving less money available for distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company failed to qualify would not be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes nor would they be required to be made 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit 
it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to such statutory relief 
the company s failure to qualify as a reit likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of its securities 
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
management believes that the operating partnership qualifies  and has so qualified since its formation  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates

the company s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets for impairment indicators 
factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company s existing real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
generally  a real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book value at the balance sheet date 
assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management 
in and in prior years  the company recorded impairment charges on assets held for investment and assets designated as held for sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of its assets 
as of the years ended december  and  management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
however  should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record additional impairment charges 
if any real estate asset held for investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value  less selling costs 
any future impairment could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the charge is taken 
expansion of the company s operations into condominium conversion and for sale housing condominiums would be a new segment of the company s operations involving new business risks and challenges for management 
expansion into condominium conversions and for sale housing condominiums would be a new segment of the company s operations 
the company s ability to successfully complete a condominium conversion or other for sale housing project  sell the units and achieve management s economic goals in connection with the transaction is subject to various risks and challenges  which if they materialize  may have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition including the inability to obtain approvals to rezone the property and releases from financing obligations and increases in costs resulting from delays in obtaining such approvals and releases  increases in costs of improving the property  lack of demand by prospective buyers  the inability of buyers to qualify for financing  lower than anticipated sale prices  the inability to close on sales of individual units under contract  and competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing 
in addition  if the company is unable to sell converted units  the expenses and carrying costs associated with the ownership of such units would continue 
the company s shareholders may not be able to effect a change in control 
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company and the partnership agreement of the operating partnership contain a number of provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following ownership limit 
one of the requirements for maintenance of the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals  including entities specified in the internal revenue code  during the last half of any taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under the post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents company s articles of incorporation prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock  subject to an exception for shares of common stock held by mr 
williams and mr 
glover  the company s former chairman and former vice chairman and certain investors for which the company has waived the ownership limit 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
further  the company s articles of incorporation include provisions allowing it to stop transfers of and redeem its shares that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements 
while the company has committed that it will not utilize the ownership limit in its articles of incorporation as an anti takeover device  these provisions could still deter  delay or defer someone from taking control of the company 
staggered board 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the board of directors will consist of eight members and can be increased or decreased after that according to its bylaws  provided that the total number of directors is not less than three nor more than pursuant to the company s bylaws  the number of directors will be fixed by the board of directors within the limits in its articles of incorporation 
the board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors for each class are chosen for a three year term 
the staggered terms for directors may affect the ability of the company s shareholders to effect a change of control  even if a change of control would be in the interest of the shareholders 
under a proposed amendment to the company s bylaws that the board of directors will recommend to the shareholders for approval at the company s annual meeting of shareholders  the board of directors would be declassified and each director elected at or after the annual meeting would be elected annually by the shareholders 
preferred shares 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the company has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  were outstanding as of december  the board of directors has the authority  without the approval of the shareholders  to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of such shares 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  even if a change of control were in the shareholders interest 
consent rights of the unitholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the company may not merge or consolidate with another entity unless the merger includes the merger of the operating partnership  which requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of the operating partnership 
if the company were to ever hold less than a majority of the units  this voting requirement might limit the possibility for an acquisition or a change of control

as used in this report  the term company includes post properties  inc and its subsidiaries  including post apartment homes  lp the operating partnership  unless the context indicates otherwise 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and owns a majority interest in the operating partnership which  through its subsidiaries  conducts substantially all of the on going operations of the company 
at december   the company owned  apartment units in apartment communities  including apartment units in communities held in unconsolidated entities  and including apartment units currently under lease up in two apartment communities 
at december   approximately  and on a unit basis of the company s communities were located in the atlanta  dallas and tampa metropolitan area  respectively 
the company has elected to qualify and operate as a self administrated and self managed real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
a reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and  through payments of dividends to shareholders  in practical effect is not subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level 
at december   the company owned approximately of the common limited partnership interests common units in the operating partnership 
common units held by persons including certain directors other than the company represented a common minority interest in the operating partnership 
over the last few years  the multifamily sector has experienced weakness caused primarily by overall weakness in the us economy and a soft employment market  the strong single family housing market caused by historically low mortgage interest rates and excess multifamily supply 
these factors have contributed to an increase in apartment vacancies and  in turn  lower net effective rents as multifamily apartment owners have sought to compete in this increasingly competitive environment 
as a result  the company s same store revenue and net operating income have declined  turning negative since and continuing into  although there have been ongoing signs of gradual stabilization 
a number of the company s markets  particularly its largest markets in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas which constitute approximately three quarters on a unit basis of the company s portfolio  were particularly adversely impacted  with multifamily vacancy rates in those markets increasing over that same period 
in order to effectively compete  the company has had to offer concessions and reduce net effective rents in its portfolio 
as a result of these factors  revenues and net operating income at the company s fully stabilized same store communities experienced declines of and in and and in  respectively 
average economic occupancy at the company s fully stabilized same store communities also declined from in to in in response to weakness in the economy and the multifamily sector  the company enacted a number of cost containment and cost reduction measures during fiscal and fiscal the company reduced its associate workforce by about one quarter  from  associates at december  to associates at december  as a result of such measures  the company was able to hold fully stabilized same store operating expense growth to in this is the second year in a row the company has been able to hold operating expense growth to less than

this reduced the number of the company s markets from thirteen to ten 
the company has also been taking advantage of strong capital market conditions to sell many of its older and least well located communities 
during  the company sold a total of five apartment communities one held in an unconsolidated entity 
the company also expects to sell nine additional communities in the first and second quarters of this asset sales program is consistent with the company s overall strategy to take advantage of high demand for apartment assets  reduce the average age of the portfolio and lessen its market concentration in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas 
the company plans to utilize the proceeds from these asset sales partly to strengthen its balance sheet and partly to reinvest in new developments and acquisitions that enhance the diversification of its cash flow stream and the quality of its portfolio  such as in the greater washington  dc  tampa and orlando markets  among others 
in an effort to strengthen its balance sheet  the company redeemed its  series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock on march  with proceeds from asset sales 
the operating partnership is also considering redeeming its  series d cumulative redeemable preferred units when those preferred units become callable on september  with expected proceeds from asset sales  although there are no assurances that the company will do so

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in the preparation of financial statements and in the determination of company operating performance  the company utilizes certain significant accounting polices and these accounting policies are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there are several new accounting pronouncements issued in and the potential impact of certain new post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents pronouncements on the company is discussed below and in the consolidated financial statements 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing apartment communities  its critical accounting policies relate to cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and the asset classification and accounting for real estate assets held for sale 
the company capitalizes those expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  developing new apartment communities and enhancing of the value of existing assets and those expenditures that substantially extend the life of existing assets 
all other expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
additionally  for new development communities  carpet  vinyl and blind replacements are expensed as incurred during the first five years which corresponds to their estimated depreciable lives 
thereafter  these replacements are capitalized and depreciated 
further  the company expenses as incurred all interior and exterior painting of communities 
for communities under development  the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to apartment communities under development and construction 
interest is capitalized to projects under development based upon the weighted average cumulative project costs for each period multiplied by the company s weighted average borrowing costs  expressed as a percentage 
weighted average borrowing costs include the costs of the company s fixed rate secured and unsecured borrowings and the variable rate unsecured borrowings under its line of credit facilities 
the weighted average borrowing costs  expressed as a percentage  for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the weighted average borrowing costs used by the company for interest capitalization generally increases as the company s variable rate unsecured debt decreases and decreases as the company s variable rate unsecured debt increases 
the internal personnel and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort identifiable with such projects 
as the company s annual development activities fall below a range of  to  the company must either reduce its internal personnel and associated costs related to development and construction activities or reflect such costs as current period expenses 
in  the company expensed approximately of internal personnel and associated costs related to development activities due to the reduced volume of development expenditures in the last half of the company treats each unit in an apartment community separately for cost accumulation  capitalization and expense recognition purposes 
prior to commencing leasing activities  interest and other construction costs are capitalized and reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress 
the company ceases capitalizing such costs as the residential units in a community become substantially complete and available for occupancy 
this accounting results in a proration of these costs between amounts that are capitalized and expensed as the residential units in a development community become available for occupancy 
in addition  prior to the completion of units  the company expenses as incurred substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing as well as property management and leasing personnel expenses of such communities 
this has historically resulted in operating deficits during the lease up of newly developed communities see below for discussion 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered by management in evaluating impairment of its existing real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
under sfas no 
 a real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of an asset both the annual estimated cash flow from future operations and the estimated cash flow from the theoretical sale of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book value at the balance sheet date 
assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of company management 
at december  and  management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record future impairment charges 
if any real estate asset held for investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recognized an impairment loss in on one asset held for investment under the application of this standard 
the company periodically classifies real estate assets as held for sale 
an asset is classified as held for sale after the approval of the company s internal investment committee and after an actual program to sell the asset has commenced 
upon the classification of a real estate asset as held for sale  the carrying value of the asset is reduced post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents to the lower of its net book value or its fair value  less costs to sell the asset 
subsequent to the classification of assets as held for sale  no further depreciation expense is recorded 
real estate assets held for sale are stated separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
effective january  through the implementation of sfas no 
 the operating results of real estate assets held for sale and sold are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying statements of operations 
the income from discontinued operations includes the revenues and expenses including depreciation and allocated interest expense  associated with the assets 
interest expense is allocated to assets held for sale based on actual interest costs for assets with secured mortgage debt 
interest expense is allocated to unencumbered assets based on the ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt multiplied by the weighted average interest rate on the company s unsecured debt for the period and further multiplied by the book value of the assets held for sale and sold 
this classification of operating results as discontinued operations applies retroactively for all periods presented for assets designated as held for sale subsequent to january  additionally  gains and losses on assets designated as held for sale subsequent to january  are classified as part of discontinued operations 
in years prior to  real estate assets held for sale were stated separately on the consolidated balance sheet in a manner consistent with the approach discussed above 
however  the operating results and gains or losses on the sale of such assets were included in continuing operations 
as a result of this presentation  income from continuing operations and gains on property sales are not comparable for years prior to in and  the financial accounting standards board issued several new accounting pronouncements  and the pronouncements with a potential impact on the company are discussed in the following paragraphs 
sfas no

 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections was issued in may sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt  which provided that gains and losses from early debt retirements be treated as extraordinary items 
under sfas no 
 gains and losses from early debt retirements will only be treated as extraordinary items if they meet the criteria for extraordinary items under apb no 
since the definition of an extraordinary item is more restrictive under apb no 
 sfas no 
will generally cause the company to treat gains or losses from early debt retirements as part of income before extraordinary items 
this part of sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after may  and required the reclassification of prior period extraordinary items not meeting the apb no 
criteria 
the company adopted this requirement of sfas no 
on january  upon implementation  the company reclassified  net of minority interest  in and  net of minority interest  in from extraordinary items to expenses used in the determination of income from continuing operations 
the remaining provisions of sfas no 
were generally not applicable to the company 
sfas no

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the implementation of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position

results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations  the accompanying selected financial data and the community operations segment performance information included below 
the company s revenues and earnings are generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
the company generally considers a community to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or one year after completion of construction 
for the year ended december   the company s portfolio of apartment communities  excluding three communities held in unconsolidated entities and nine communities held for sale  consisted of the following communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  four communities that achieved full stabilization during  and three communities that were in the lease up stage during the year 
sold communities include communities sold in and that were not reflected in discontinued operations under sfas no 
see discussion under discontinued operations 
these operating segments exclude the operations of apartment communities classified as discontinued operations and apartment communities held in unconsolidated entities for the years presented 
the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
lease up deficits for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively

table of contents in order to evaluate the operating performance of its communities for the comparative years listed below  the company has presented financial information which summarizes the rental and other revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and net operating income on a comparative basis for all of its operating communities and for its stabilized operating communities 
net operating income is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled income loss from continuing operations is the most directly comparable gaap measure to net operating income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of net operating income to gaap income loss from continuing operations 
the company believes that net operating income is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of the core operations  rather than factoring in depreciation and amortization  financing costs and general and administrative expenses 
this measure is particularly useful  in the opinion of the company  in evaluating the performance of geographic operations  operating segment groupings and individual properties 
additionally  the company believes that net operating income  as defined  is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate investment community 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the operating performance from continuing operations for all of the company s apartment communities summarized by segment for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows change rental and other revenues fully stabilized communities communities stabilized in prior year lease up communities sold communities other revenue property operating and maintenance expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization fully stabilized communities communities stabilized in prior year lease up communities sold communities other expense net operating income recurring capital expenditures carpet other total non recurring capital expenditures average apartment units in service communities which reached stabilization prior to january  communities in the construction  development or lease up stage during and  therefore  not considered fully stabilized for all of the periods presented

other revenue excludes interest income included in total revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
other expenses includes certain indirect central office operating expenses related to management  grounds maintenance  and costs associated with commercial properties and furnished apartment rentals 
in addition to those expenses which relate to property operations  the company incurs recurring and non recurring expenditures relating to acquiring and developing new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset  all of which are capitalized 
recurring capital expenditures are those that are generally expected to be incurred on an annual basis 
non recurring capital expenditures are those that generally occur less frequently than on an annual basis

these charges are discussed in more detail in the section below titled  discontinued operations 
in addition  the decline in net income reflects a decrease in fully stabilized communities operating performance and reduced earnings resulting from the company s asset sale and capital recycling program 
the impact of these items is also discussed below 
rental and other revenues increased  or from to primarily due to increased revenues from the company s newly stabilized and lease up communities of  or offset by the revenue decline of  or from fully stabilized communities discussed further below 
the revenue increase from communities stabilized in reflects full year stabilized operating performance in compared to a partial lease up period in the revenue increase from lease up communities in reflects the increased occupancy of the communities between periods as these communities continued their initial lease up 
property operating and maintenance expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased  or primarily due to increased expenses from newly stabilized and lease up communities as these expenses typically increase as property occupancy levels increase towards stabilized occupancy levels and as new lease up properties are placed in service 
property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for fully stabilized communities also increased  or between periods see discussion below 
the company reported no net gains on property sales in continuing operations in  as under the provisions of sfas no 
all gains losses on sales of properties classified as held for sale subsequent to january  are classified in discontinued operations

depreciation expense increased  or from to primarily due to increased depreciation on newly stabilized and lease up properties  as these properties were placed in service  partially offset by the cessation of depreciation on properties sold and classified as held for sale 
interest expense increased  or from to primarily due to a  reduction in capitalized interest to development properties between years as the company s development pipeline transitioned to operating properties in late and early in addition to the impact of capitalized interest  the remaining increase in interest expense from continuing operations results from more of overall interest being reflected in discontinued operations in as compared to excluding the reduction in capitalized interest between periods  the combined interest expense in continuing and discontinued operations was relatively flat between periods

stabilized communities the company defines fully stabilized communities as those which have reached stabilization prior to the beginning of the previous year 
for the to comparison  fully stabilized communities are defined as those communities which reached stabilization prior to january  this portfolio consisted of communities with  units  including communities with  units located in atlanta  georgia  communities with  units located in dallas  texas  three communities with  units located in tampa  florida and seven communities with  units located in other markets

this trend was especially true for the company s largest markets  atlanta  georgia  and dallas  texas  which experienced rental and other revenue declines of  and  respectively  between years

this strategy resulted in increased year over year reductions in the average rental rate per apartment unit between periods in compared to in  and an overall decline in year over year total rental and other revenues between years in compared to in 
in years prior to  the company s leasing strategy focused more on maintaining average monthly rental rates than on retaining occupancy 
the company believed this strategy change was necessary to maximize its operating results under the market conditions existing in  to operate the company s communities more efficiently at higher occupancy levels and to be in a better position to increase rental rates as market conditions improve

the retirement of outstanding debt and the redemption of outstanding preferred stock are expected to result in additional expenses associated with the write off of unamortized issuance costs  as well as the termination of related derivative contract hedges and prepayment premiums  if any see discussion below 
as the timing of the sales and the resulting reduction in property net operating income may not coincide with the reinvestment of the proceeds in similar yielding assets or financing cost reductions  the company s overall net income will be somewhat diluted in until such reinvestments or similar financing cost reductions occur 
management expects interest expense in to be lower than in due generally to lower average debt levels between years 
management expects general and administrative  development costs and other expenses to increase in resulting from the increased amortization of prior year restricted stock and stock option awards  generally higher costs related to sarbanes oxley and corporate governance compliance and the expensing of a larger portion of previously capitalized development personnel and related costs

management currently intends to continue operating the company as a reit in as a reit  the company is subject to a number of organizational and operating requirements  including a requirement to distribute of its taxable income to its shareholders 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on its taxable income 
generally  the company s objective is to meet its short term liquidity requirement of funding the payment of its current level of quarterly preferred and common dividends to shareholders through its net cash flows provided by operating activities  less its annual recurring and nonrecurring property and corporate capital expenditures 
these operating capital expenditures are the capital expenditures necessary to maintain the earnings capacity of the company s operating assets over time 
in order to better align with this objective in  the company reduced its quarterly dividend payment rate to common shareholders from a rate of per share to per share effective with the quarterly dividend paid for the first quarter of in  the additional funding  in excess of cash flows from operating activities less operating capital expenditures as discussed above  required to pay the quarterly dividends was funded through a combination of line of credit borrowings and proceeds from asset sales 
the factors that led to the dividend reduction were the decline in economic and market conditions in the company s major markets resulting in lower cash flow from its operating property portfolio  the slower lease up of its existing development community portfolio and the short term negative cash flow impact of funding its current development portfolio through the sale of operating real estate assets

the factors leading to this net operating cash flow shortfall are the continuing soft market conditions for the company s operating properties and the short term impact negative cash flow impact of sales of operating properties discussed below prior to the reinvestment of such proceeds 
the company s board of directors  however  will continue to review the dividend quarterly 
management expects the company to meet its future construction and development and certain of its other long term liquidity requirements  including maturities of long term debt and lines of credit  debt and equity commitments to unconsolidated entities summarized below and possible land and property acquisitions through the selective sale of operating properties and through long term secured and unsecured borrowings 
management believes the company has adequate borrowing capacity and access to real estate sales markets to fund these requirements 
the capacity under the company s lines of credit was created primarily through proceeds from property sales and from the repayment of construction advances to unconsolidated entities 
additionally  in prior years the company has utilized equity joint ventures as a means of raising capital and reducing the size and exposure of its development property pipeline 
the company may continue to use joint venture arrangements in future years as a source of capital  to reduce its market concentrations in certain markets and to reduce its exposure to certain risks of its future development pipeline

the proceeds from these sales are intended to be used for various corporate purposes and may be used to fund future development expenditures  future property acquisitions  future debt reduction and to opportunistically repurchase the company s preferred see discussion below and common stock 
these sales are also expected to generate capital gains for tax purposes in of approximately  to  realized capital gains must generally be distributed to shareholders  in the form of dividends  in order to avoid the payment of income taxes at the corporate level 
the company expects to be able to use its regular quarterly dividend of per share  as well as other tax planning strategies  to pay out or otherwise mitigate the impact of these capital gains 
although the company currently does not have plans to do so  the company may also evaluate a special dividend 
these sales are part of the company s plans to focus its operations in fewer markets  maintain the low average age and high quality of the portfolio and reduce the company s market concentrations in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas

all other expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek increases in rents 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements generally provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination 
in addition  the company s policy generally permits the earlier termination of a lease by a lessee upon thirty days written notice to the company and the payment of an amount equal to two month s rent as compensation for early termination

funds from operations the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by nareit as net income loss available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
in october  nareit issued additional guidance modifying the definition of ffo 
the first modification revised the treatment of asset impairment losses and impairment losses incurred to write down assets to their fair value at the date assets are classified as held for sale  to include such losses in ffo 
previously such losses were excluded from ffo consistent with the treatment of gains on property sales 
the second modification clarified the treatment of original issue costs and premiums paid on preferred stock redemptions to deduct such costs and premiums in determining ffo available to common shareholders 
this modification was consistent with the recently clarified treatment of these costs under gaap 
the company has adopted the modifications to the definition of ffo effective with its reported results for the third quarter of prior year presentations of ffo have been restated to conform with the revised definition of ffo 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies because not all real estate companies use the same definition 
the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
the company also uses ffo as an operating measure 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit for the reit industry to provide an alternate measure 
since the company agrees with the concept of ffo and appreciates the reasons surrounding its creation  management believes that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
in addition  since most equity reits provide ffo information to the investment community  the company believes ffo is a useful supplemental measure for comparing the company s results to those of other equity reits 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance 
while management believes that ffo is an important supplemental non gaap financial measure  management believes it is also important to stress that ffo should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity 
further  ffo is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs or ability to service indebtedness or make distributions
