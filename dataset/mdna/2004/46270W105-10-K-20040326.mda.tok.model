item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  which reflect our current views about future events and financial results 
we have made these statements in reliance on the safe harbor created by that private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include our views on future financial results  financing sources  product development  capital requirements  market growth and the like  and are generally identified by phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans and similar words 
forward looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statement 
these uncertainties and other factors include  among other things unexpected technical and marketing difficulties inherent in major product development efforts such as the new platform for our urinalysis workstation  the potential need for changes in our long term strategy in response to future developments  future advances in diagnostic testing methods and procedures  as well as potential changes in government regulations and healthcare policies  both of which could adversely affect the economics of the diagnostic testing procedures automated by our products  rapid technological change in the microelectronics and software industries  and increasing competition from imaging and non imaging based in vitro diagnostic products 
set forth below are additional significant uncertainties and other factors affecting forward looking statements 
the readers should understand that the uncertainties and other factors identified in this annual report are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors that could affect those statements 
overview iris international  inc was incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in our company consists of three operating units 
our largest unit  iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets in vitro diagnostics ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis 
our statspin subsidiary markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing  and our advanced digital imaging and research llc adir subsidiary assists in the advancement of proprietary imaging technology while conducting government sponsored research and contract development in imaging and pattern recognition 
we have pioneered a number of important medical developments 
in  our diagnostics division pioneered the first urinalysis workstation integrating automation of urine sediment analysis the yellow iris 
in  statspin shipped the statspin  the world fastest blood separator 
this statspin product addressed the need for short turnaround time stat on blood separation for diagnosis in critical care conditions 
was a transition year for us because we launched our new iq analyzer in august we incurred significant expenses relating to the product launch of the iq  manufacturing learning curve  international expansion and training relating to new product introduction 
in addition  we experienced a significant senior management transition during resulting in approximately million in costs arising from severance agreements  of which  occurred in the fourth quarter 
also during the fourth quarter  we achieved our highest quarterly revenues over million 
however we realized only a small profit for the quarter after experiencing the unusual expenses mentioned above 

table of contents we generate revenues primarily from three sources ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and small laboratory device instruments and supplies 
we released our newest ivd urine analyzer  the iq  in the third quarter of although we continue to sell our legacy models model and model udx  we expect that sales of such products to diminish substantially in the future as they are expected to be replaced by the iq and future upgrades 
sales of ivd consumables supplies and services represent over of our revenues and contribute higher gross margins than other sources of revenues 
consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers 
once our analyzers and systems are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables and service 
consumable and service revenue will continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments expand 
sales of small laboratory devices and supplies primarily consist of centrifuge systems and related supplies sold by statspin 
sales of statspin s products are made worldwide through distributors 
sales of ivd analyzers  consumables and services are made both domestically and internationally 
domestic sales are made directly by our own sales staff to the customer  whereas international sales are made through independent distributors 
our international sales represented of consolidated net revenues in  but was less than in each of and with the launch of our new iq analyzer  we have increased our focus on the international marketplace  with the ultimate goal of balancing our urinalysis business between domestic and international markets 
since our international sales are made through independent distributors  our gross profit margin on such sales is lower than domestic sales of the same products 
we make significant investments in research and development for new products and enhancements to existing products 
we internally fund our research and development programs  however through adir  we also receive grants from the national institutes of health and to a lesser extent  contracts from third parties 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands research and development expense  net capitalized software development costs adir research and development grants and contracts total product technology expenditures critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies upon which our financial position and results of operations depend are those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and income tax assets and liabilities 
we summarize our most critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of small laboratory devices and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met a an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  b customer credit worthiness has been established  and c delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
the majority of domestic ivd instrument sales generally require installation and training to be performed 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue 
table of contents recognition in financial statements which generally requires revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
multiple elements of the company s domestic product sales include ivd instruments and training 
training elements are valued based on hourly rates  which the company charges for these services when sold apart from hardware sales 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
we recognize that although we have introduced a new urine analyzer in the iq  an installed based of the legacy products still exist 
we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products  a portion of which is classified as long term on our balance sheet 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to have net realizable value 
capitalized software we capitalize software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers 
we account for such software development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of capitalized software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
revenues from the ivd urinalysis segment totaled million in the current year  up from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million  an increase of million  or from the previous year 
the increase is primarily due to the third quarter release of the iq  our new urinalysis workstation  which accounted for nearly million of sales in this category 
as expected  sales of the older models declined from the prior year 
sales of ivd system consumables and services increased to million from million  an increase of  or over last year  primarily due to the larger installed 
table of contents base of ivd instruments 
revenues from the small laboratory devices segment increased to million from million  an increase of  or over this increase is primarily due to increased sales of centrifuges  parts and service within this segment 
revenues also include royalty and license fees and approximate  in each year 
we expect that such revenue will significantly decrease during  as the related licenses will begin to expire 
gross profit margins decreased to during compared to during cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the ivd urinalysis segment totaled  up from in the prior year 
cost of goods sold for ivd instruments as a percentage of sales was in the current period as compared to last year 
this increase is due to a number of factors 
our lower production levels in the first seven months of the current year provided a smaller volume of product over which overhead could be absorbed  as well as costs associated with training  small quantity procurements and start up costs related to the production of the new iq in addition a portion of this year s revenues were lower margin international sales which are made through independent distributors 
we also increased our reserves for obsolescence of slow moving inventory during the current year by approximately  which further contributed to the increase in this segment s cost of goods 
cost of goods sold for ivd consumables and services as a percentage of related sales remained constant during both years at 
cost of goods sold for small laboratory instruments segment as a percentage of sales totaled for the current year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to increased costs resulting from smaller production runs in the first half of marketing and selling expenses totaled million  compared to million last year  a increase 
the increase is due primarily to the addition of sales and service personnel  additional travel costs  increased commissions due to higher revenues  and increased marketing efforts including trade shows and marketing brochures  all associated with the launch of the iq in addition  we started a new international subsidiary and opened offices in milan and hong kong to assist our expansion into the international marketplace 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  up from in the amount of expenses we expect to incur in the future depends  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales 
in particular  we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of our products 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million from million in the prior year 
the increase is due to management restructuring costs during the current year million and increased professional fees 
net research and development expenditures decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in total product technology expenditures which include research and development costs  capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts amounted to million  down slightly from the prior year with the completion of the iq the majority of the current year expenditures relate to the new iq product  which was released in the third quarter of we expect to continue to invest in research and development during at the same rate as our primary focus in is enhancements to our existing products and investigate the feasibility into testing of body fluids 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in the prior year as a result of lower average interest rates 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december   amounted to  as compared an income tax provision of  in due to the loss experienced in and income experienced during this tax provision is a non cash item  since the company has significant deferred tax assets 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  were down  or from the prior year 
revenues from the ivd urinanalysis segment totaled million in  up slightly from million in the 
table of contents prior year 
sales of ivd instruments decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or from the last year 
the decrease is primarily due to decreased sales to international distributors 
in november  we introduced an upgraded model based on a new operating platform 
this model  named the iq  received clearance from the food and drug administration on october  in august  we began shipping of this product to the marketplace 
sales of ivd consumables and service increased to million from million  an increase of  or over the prior year  primarily due to the larger installed base of ivd instruments 
royalties and licensing revenues increased to  from  in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a  royalty received by our statspin subsidiary 
revenues from the small lab devices and supplies segment decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or 
the decline was due primarily to the decreased sales to a major oem customer  which more than offset the new  royalty earned by that segment 
gross margins amounted to for the years ended december  and cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues from the ivd segment totaled  down slightly from in the prior year 
cost of goods sold for ivd instruments as a percentage of sales of such instruments amounted to during as compared to in the increase was primarily attributable to manufacturing overhead associated with lower production levels in cost of goods sold for ivd consumables and service as a percentage of sales of such products decreased to for as compared to for the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to efficiencies derived from higher volumes and improved manufacturing processes 
cost of goods sold for laboratory devices and supplies as a percentage of sales of this segment amounted to for as compared to in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased costs resulting from smaller production runs in the current period 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million  compared to million in the prior year  an increase of  or  due primarily to increase marketing efforts in the ivd imaging segment  particularly associated with the marketing of the ax marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in  up slightly from in general and administrative expenses increased  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to the addition of senior management in general and administrative expenses represented of net revenue  up from in the prior year 
net research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
net research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the prior year 
total product technology expenditures  including capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts  was million  down very slightly from the prior year 
the continued high level of total product technology expenditures was due primarily to the iq project begun in to improve our urinalysis workstation product line 
amortization of intangible assets was lower in than in the prior year 
this was due to the fact that the balance in included only amortization of patents  whereas the year ago amounts also included the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with definite lives 
the company ceased amortization of goodwill in in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in the prior year as a result of lower interest rates associated with the revised credit facility from the company s new bank  along with a continuing reduction in indebtedness 
the income tax provision for the year ended december   totaled  as compared to million in the decrease reflects the decreased income experienced by the company in the tax provision continues to be a non cash item  since the company has significant deferred tax assets 

table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table aggregates the company s expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  in thousands totals less than year years contractual obligations long term debt short term borrowings capital lease commitments operating lease commitments total contractual cash commitments not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd urinalysis systems and the subsequent sales of consumables and service for these systems as well as the sale of small laboratory devices and supplies 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to million at december   up slightly from december  cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by operations of million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this change was an increase in receivables from the sales of iq in the fourth quarter and the overall loss for the year  offset by a million increase in payables and accrued expenses during the year as compared to the prior year 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in  as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is due to the reduction in expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software development from prior year levels 
our effort to expand and upgrade our facilities is largely complete  and the software development of the iq is also substantially completed  accordingly  we anticipate a reduction in disbursements for capitalized software during net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and consisted of additional borrowings of million under our line of credit  million obtained from a private placement of  shares of the company s stock to a group of institutional investors and approximately  received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by principal payments made on our subordinated note payable and the term loans under our credit facility 
we have an million credit facility with a bank  which consists of term loans amounting to million and a million revolving line of credit 
the  term loan is payable in equal monthly installments 
the million term loan requires monthly payments 
the million credit line matures in june borrowings under the line of credit are limited to a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory 
dependent on our debt service coverage ratio  the entire credit facility bears interest at a range between the lender s prime rate on december   or libor rate plus and the lender s prime rate plus or libor rate plus  and is secured by all of the our assets 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the debt agreement and must maintain a minimum excess borrowing availability of  under the line of credit 
at december   total borrowing under the credit facility with the bank amounted to approximately million 
as of december   we were not in compliance with one of the covenants under the debt agreement  however the bank has granted us a waiver relieving us of compliance with that covenant 
we are 
table of contents currently negotiating with the bank for an extension of the current credit facility 
there is no assurance that the bank will renew our credit line nor can there be any assurance that alternate financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
at december   the outstanding principal balance on an unsecured subordinated note payable from an unrelated party was approximately million 
the note requires monthly installments of approximately  plus interest on the unpaid balance 
the note bears interest at the prime rate on december  plus and matures on july  however  on september   the bank invoked its rights under a subordination agreement between the note holder and the bank to stop us from making further payments of the amounts owed on the note until further notice 
during the fourth quarter we sold  through a private placement   shares of our common stock at per share realizing net proceeds after deducting  of offering costs of million 
the net proceeds were utilized primarily for working capital 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal operations and pay principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for at least the next months 
however  additional funding may be required to fund further expansion of our business 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available  on terms acceptable to the company 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the guidance provided by eitf is effective for contracts entered into on or after july  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 
healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our business 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business our success depends largely on the acceptance of our new iq operating platform 
our current strategy assumes that our iq operating platform will be adopted by a large number of end users 
we have invested and continue to invest  a substantial amount of our resources in promotion and marketing of the iq operating platform in order to increase its market penetration  expand its sales into new geographic areas and enhance and expand its system features 
a failure of our iq operating platform to achieve and maintain a significant market presence  or the failure to successfully implement our promotion and marketing strategy  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any failure to successfully introduce our future products and systems into the market could adversely affect our business 
the commercial success of our future products and systems depends upon their acceptance by the medical community 
our future product plans include capital intensive laboratory instruments 
we believe that these products can significantly reduce labor costs  improve precision and offer other distinctive benefits to the medical research community 
however  there is often market resistance to products that require significant capital expenditures or which eliminate jobs through automation 
we have no assurance that the market will accept our future products and systems  or that sales of our future products and systems will grow at the rates expected by our management 
if we fail to meet changing demands of technology  we may not continue to be able to compete successfully with our competitors 
the market for our products and systems is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success depends upon our ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  enhance current product lines and respond to evolving customer requirements 
our failure to meet these demands could result in a loss of our market share and competitiveness and could harm our revenues and results of operations 
any failure or inability to protect our technology and confidential information could adversely affect our business 
patents 
our commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our automated intelligent microscopy or aim and other proprietary technology 
we have received patents with respect to portions of the technologies of aim 
however  ownership of technology patents may not insulate us from potentially damaging competition 
patent litigation relating to clinical laboratory instrumentation patents like the ones we own often involves complex legal and factual questions 
therefore  we can make no assurance that claims under patents currently held by us  or our pending or future patent applications  will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect what we believe to be our proprietary rights 
additionally  one or more of our patents could be circumvented by a competitor 
we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any infringement claim our patents  or patents in which we have licensed rights  may be held invalid and unenforceable 
trade secrets 
we have trade secrets  unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge related to the sale  promotion  operation  development and manufacturing of our products 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants 
however  we cannot guarantee that our trade secrets  unpatented technology or proprietary knowledge will not become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if any of this proprietary information becomes known to third parties  we may have no practical recourse against these parties 

table of contents copyrights 
we claim copyrights in our software and the ways in which it assembles and displays images 
we also claim trademark rights in the united states and other foreign countries 
however  we can make no assurance that we will be able to obtain enforceable copyright and trademark protection  nor that this protection will provide us a significant commercial advantage 
potential litigation expenses 
offensive or defensive litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could be time consuming and expensive 
additionally  litigation could demand significant attention from our technical and management personnel 
any change in our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
given the complete factual and legal issues associated with intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that our current and future products do not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a determination that such infringement exists or even a claim that it exists could involve us in costly litigation and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we operate in a consolidating industry which creates barriers to our market penetration 
the healthcare industry in recent years has been characterized by consolidation 
large hospital chains and groups of affiliated hospitals prefer to negotiate comprehensive supply contracts for all of their supply needs at once 
large suppliers can often equip an entire laboratory and offer these hospital chains and groups one stop shopping for laboratory instruments  supplies and service 
larger suppliers also typically offer annual rebates to their customers based on the customer s total volume of business with the supplier 
the convenience and rebates offered by these large suppliers are administrative and financial incentives that we do not offer our customers 
our plans for further market penetration in the urinalysis market will depend in part on our ability to overcome these and any new barriers resulting from continued consolidation in the healthcare industry 
the failure to overcome such barriers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
since we operate in the medical technology industry  our products are subject to government regulation that could impair our operations 
most of our products are subject to stringent government regulation in the united states and other countries 
these regulatory processes can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
additionally  securing necessary clearances or approvals may require the submission of extensive official data and other supporting information 
our failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances  refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices  or criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 
changes in existing federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  or in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws  could also materially and adversely affect our business 
changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
federal and state legislative proposals are periodically introduced or proposed that would affect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our industry or our business 
any impairment in our ability to market our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 

table of contents we may need additional capital in the future 
if additional capital is not available  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
we have limited capital and will require substantial capital resources to execute our business strategy 
also  there can be no assurance that all or even a significant portion of the capital sought can be raised 
any additional equity financings may be dilutive to our existing stockholders and may involve the issuance of securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
a debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants on our business that could limit our operational and financial flexibility  and the amount of debt incurred could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns or operational difficulties and limit our ability to compete 
furthermore  financing may not be available when needed and  if available  may not be on terms acceptable to us 
we have a history of significant operating losses and we may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and  as of december   we had accumulated a deficit of approximately million 
we may not achieve profitability in the future and further losses may arise 
our ability to achieve profitable operations in the future will depend on our ability to sell our products at sufficient volumes and with sufficient margins to be profitable 
if we are unable to do so  we will not be profitable and our financial condition and results of operation will suffer 
we may not be able to realize the deferred tax asset relating to our tax net operating loss carry forward 
as of december   iris has deferred tax assets in excess of million resulting from the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate taxable income in the years that the differences reverse 
our success depends largely on sales of laboratory instruments and related sales of consumables and service contracts 
historically  we derived most of our revenues from the sale of urinalysis workstations 
relatively modest declines in unit sales or gross margins for this product line could diminish our revenues and profits 
in addition  because our installed instruments utilize a large volume of consumables and produce service revenue  a decline in our installed base will diminish our revenues and profits even further 
we rely on independent and some single source suppliers for key components of our instruments 
any delay or disruption in the supply of components may prevent us from selling our products and negatively impact our operations 
certain of our components are obtained from outside vendors  the loss or breakdown of our relationships with these outside vendors could subject us to substantial delays in the delivery of our products to our customers 
furthermore  certain key components of our instruments are manufactured by only one supplier 
for example  arkray is the single source supplier for our new line of urine chemistry analyzers and related consumable products and spare parts 
roche diagnostics is the sole source for our proprietary chemstrip iristrip urine test strips and related urine test strip readers  both used in the model and udx urinalysis workstations 
because these suppliers are the only vendors with which we have a relationship for a particular component  we may be unable to sell products if one of these suppliers becomes unwilling or unable to deliver components meeting our specifications 
our inability to sell products to meet delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry as well as our financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents one of our single source suppliers has terminated its agreement with us 
roche diagnostics has exercised its right  to terminate the agreements relating to the supply of test strips and related urine test strip readers 
roche will continue to supply test strips and replacement readers to our installed base of workstations for six years after termination of these contracts or the failure to successfully and timely complete the phase out their strips and readers with the introduction of our new iq analyzers would have a material adverse affect on our instrument sales and the revenue growth for system supplies and service 
we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively  particularly against larger  more established companies will cause our business to suffer 
the healthcare industry is very competitive 
we compete in this industry based primarily on performance  service  and price 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do  and may also have substantially greater experience in developing products  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing and distribution 
as a result they may be better able to compete for market share  even in areas in which our products may be superior 
further  our competitive position could be harmed by the establishment of patent protection by our competitors or other companies 
the existing competitors or other companies may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or affordable than those being developed by us or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
if we are unable to effectively compete in our market  our financial condition and results of operation will materially suffer 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate management and other skilled employees 
our success depends in significant part upon the continued services of key management and skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and there are a limited number of people with knowledge of  and experience in  our industry 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our key employees nor maintain life insurance polices on them 
the loss of key personnel  especially without advance notice  or our inability to hire or retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our instrument sales and our ability to maintain our technological edge 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to retain our key management and skilled personnel  or that we will be able to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
defective products may subject us to liability 
our products are used to gather information for medical decisions and diagnosis 
accordingly  a defect in the design or manufacture of our products  or a failure of our products to perform for the use that we specify  could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability arising from inaccurate or allegedly inaccurate test results 
misuse of our products by a technician that results in inaccurate or allegedly inaccurate test results could similarly subject us to claims of liability 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage for up to million per incident and up to an aggregate of million per year 
we also currently maintain a product liability umbrella policy for coverage of claims aggregating more than million 
although management believes this liability coverage is sufficient protection against future claims  there can be no assurance of the sufficiency of these policies 
any substantial underinsured loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
furthermore  any impairment of our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our sales  revenues and prospects for future business 
we have not received any indication that our insurance carrier will not renew our product liability insurance at or near current premiums  however  we cannot guarantee that this will continue to be the case 
in addition  any failure to comply with federal drug administration regulations governing manufacturing practices could hamper our ability to defend against product liability lawsuits 

table of contents business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
products for iris diagnostics and statspin are manufactured in a single facility for each division and are vulnerable to interruption in the event of war  terrorism  fire  earthquake  power loss  floods  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
if our facilities were significantly damaged or destroyed by any cause  we would experience delays in locating a new facility and equipment and qualifying the new facility with the fda 
our results would suffer 
in addition  we may not carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could be substantial 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our results could suffer 
we have been experiencing significant growth in the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as operational resources 
in order to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to grow 
if this growth occurs  it will continue to place additional significant demands on our management and our operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally 
in particular  our growth rate has increased  if it continues  will increase the challenges in implementing appropriate control systems  expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure capabilities  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards  and preserving our cultural values 
the main challenge associated with our growth has been cash flow management 
our inability to scale our business appropriately or otherwise adopt to growth  could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
our quarterly sales and operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and if we fail to meet expectations the price of our common stock may decline 
our quarterly sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to do so in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our quarterly sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our sales and operating results include the following variation in demand for our products  including seasonality  our ability to develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products and product enhancements in a timely manner  our ability to manage inventories  accounts receivable and cash flows  our ability to control costs  the size  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from consumers and distributors  our ability to forecast future sales and operating results and subsequently attain them  the amount of expenses we incur depends  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales 
in particular  we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of our products 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in sales  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
if this occurs  we will not be profitable 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
we depend on independent distributors to sell our products in international markets 
we sell our products in international markets through independent distributors 
these distributors may not command the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products 
if a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals  it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor 
if a change in our 
table of contents distributors becomes necessary  we may experience increased costs  as well as substantial disruption and a resulting loss of sales 
our sales in international markets are subject to a variety of laws and political and economic risks that may adversely impact our sales and results of operations in certain regions 
our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations 
these include changes in currency exchange rates which impact the price to international consumers  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and the difficulties associated with promoting products in unfamiliar cultures 
we are also subject to general  political  economic and regulatory risks in connection with our international sales operations  including political instability  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets  and changes in regulatory schemes 
any of the abovementioned factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operations in international markets 
we are subject to currency fluctuations 
we are exposed to certain foreign currency risks in the importation of goods from japan the new line of urine chemistry analyzers  some assemblies for our iq platform and related consumables strips and spare parts are sourced from arkray  a supplier located in kyoto  japan 
our purchases from this supplier are dominated in japanese yen 
these components represent a significant portion of our material costs 
fluctuations in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in increased costs for our key components 
any such increases would reduce our gross margins and would be likely to result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
similarly  we are also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the exportation of our products 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  any fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the currency of the country with which we are exporting products would also reduce our gross margins and would be likely to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
risks related to ownership of our common stock our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company 
our certificate of incorporation empowers the board of directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock  and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of the preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation also prohibits stockholder action by written consent 
these provisions give the board of directors the ability to deter  discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company  even if such a change in control would be in the interest of a significant number of our stockholders or if such a change in control 
table of contents would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price for the common stock 
anti takeover provisions of delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock or preventing changes in our management
