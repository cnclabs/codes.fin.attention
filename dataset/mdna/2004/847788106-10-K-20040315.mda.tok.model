item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we derive revenues principally from the following sale of tickets to motorsports races and other events held at our speedway facilities  licensing of network television  cable television and radio rights to broadcast such events  sale of sponsorships  facility naming rights and promotions to companies that desire to advertise or sell their products or services surrounding such events  
table of contents commissions earned on sales of food  beverages and hospitality catering and sales of souvenirs and other motorsports related merchandise  and rental of luxury suites during such events and other track facilities 
we derive additional revenue from the operations of the speedway clubs at lms and tms  racing  mbm  oil chem  racing country usa  smi trackside  the source international and certain smi properties revenues 
see business other operating revenue and note to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these businesses 
operating strategy our operating strategy is to increase revenues and profitability through the promotion and production of racing and related events at modern facilities  which serve to enhance customer loyalty  and the marketing and distribution of racing and other sports related souvenir  apparel and other merchandise 
we market our scheduled events throughout the year both regionally and nationally using extensive and innovative marketing activities 
the key components of this strategy  which are further described above in business operating strategy  are as follows commitment to quality and customer satisfaction  innovative marketing and promotional efforts  and utilization of media 
growth strategy we believe we can achieve our objectives of growing revenues and profitability by increasing attendance  broadcasting  sponsorship and other revenues at existing facilities  and by expanding our promotional and marketing expertise to take advantage of opportunities in attractive existing and new markets 
in particular  we are concentrating on further developing long term contracted revenue streams  which are less susceptible to weather and economic conditions 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy  which is further described above in business growth strategy  through the following means maximize media exposure and enhance broadcast and sponsorship revenues  expand and improve existing facilities  further develop smi properties  performance racing network and racing legends car businesses  increase daily usage of existing facilities  and acquire and develop additional motorsports facilities 
we promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although we sell a substantial number of tickets well in advance of our larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on our results of operations 
significant growth in our revenues will depend on consistent investment in facilities 
we have several capital projects underway at each of our speedways 
we do not believe our financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
we have generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices 
revenues and expenses our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  us in assessing our operations 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue

other operating revenue includes speedway clubs restaurant  catering and membership income  legends car operations  industrial park rentals  and mbm  oil chem  smi trackside  tsi and certain smi properties revenues 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than souvenir sales  as well as sales of legends cars  mbm  oil chem  smi trackside  tsi or other operating revenues

seasonality and quarterly results we plan to promote major annual racing events in sanctioned by nascar  including ten nextel cup and seven busch series racing events 
we will also sponsor two irl racing events  six nascar craftsman truck series racing events  two iroc racing events  four major nhra racing events  and three woo racing events 
our business has been  and is expected to remain  highly seasonal 

table of contents we sometimes produce minimal operating income or losses during our third quarter when we host only one major nascar race weekend 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in our operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to increase operating losses or minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
racing schedules may be changed from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business 
as previously reported on our quarterly reports on form q for fiscal  revenues and operating expenses were recognized for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted except for major nascar and other sanctioned racing events which occur on the last full weekend of a calendar quarter 
when major racing events occurred on the last full weekend of a calendar quarter  the race event revenues and operating expenses were recognized in the current or immediately succeeding calendar quarter that corresponded to the calendar quarter of the prior year in which the same major racing event was conducted 
this recognition policy had no impact on the reporting of full year operating results 
beginning in  we will recognize revenues and operating expenses for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted including major nascar and other sanctioned racing events because of the increased frequency of changes in race schedules in recent years 
this change will have no impact on the reporting of full year operating results 
the quarterly information below shows excerpted results from our quarterly reports on form q filed in the years ended december  and adjusted to reflect this policy for recognizing revenues and operating expenses for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted 
amounts previously reported on form q for the affected quarters include first quarter total revenues of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per share of  and second quarter total revenues of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
the adjustments had no impact on the reporting of full year operating results for or any quarter or full year operating results for the more significant racing schedule changes that have occurred during the last three years include the following ams hosted an irl event in the second quarter which was not held in bms hosted a new nascar craftsman truck series event in the third quarter bms hosted nascar nextel cup and busch series events in the first quarter which were held in the second quarter bms hosted woo and udtra pro dirt car series racing events in the second quarter which were not held in lms hosted a new nascar craftsman truck series event in the second quarter lvms hosted a nascar craftsman truck series racing event in the third quarter which was held in the fourth quarter tms hosted nascar nextel cup and busch series events in the first quarter which were held in the second quarter tms hosted nascar craftsman truck and irl series events in the fourth quarter which were held in the third quarter tms hosted nascar craftsman truck and irl series events in the third quarter which were held in the fourth quarter as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no

the national incidents of september   along with the iraq war and code orange terrorism alerts  have raised a combination of operating factors never before encountered  including public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
those factors  in a challenging economy  continue to affect consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
economic conditions and the competitiveness of racing can affect ticket and other sales 
management believes long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow 
however  near term ticket sales  particularly to corporate customers  and suite rentals  hospitality and other event revenues have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted by these and other factors 
we decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices in to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
nascar broadcasting rights agreement 
fiscal is our fourth year under the multi year consolidated domestic television broadcast rights agreement for nascar nextel formerly winston cup and busch series events 
this agreement is expected to provide us with future increases in contracted broadcasting revenues 
total revenues under this domestic broadcast rights agreement  based on the current race schedule  are contracted for approximately million in  reflecting an increase of approximately million or over while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue to increase at a relatively higher rate 
purse and sanction fees are negotiated with nascar on an annual basis 
other operating revenue 
we intend to develop new merchandising opportunities  expand our product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and market racing and other sports related souvenir merchandise and apparel with broadcasters and other third party venues 
our other operating revenues may increase depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts  the success of motorsports  particularly nascar s nextel cup series  and future market demand  trends and competition for our non event products and outside venues 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than our broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 

table of contents insurance coverage 
heightened concerns and challenges regarding property  casualty  liability  business interruption  and other insurance coverage have resulted after the national incidents on september  and incidents similar to the pedestrian bridge collapse at lms in it has become increasingly difficult to obtain high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs  including coverage for acts of terrorism 
we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our six speedway facilities  generally located near highly populated cities  and which hold motorsports events typically attended by large numbers of fans 
these operational  geographical  and situational factors  among others  have resulted in significant increases in insurance premium costs in fiscal and  and further increases are possible 
while management believes it has reasonable limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance in force  including coverage for acts of terrorism  management can not guarantee that such coverage would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur 
the occurrence of such an incident at any of our speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and or our liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits 
the occurrence of additional national incidents  and particularly incidents at sporting event  entertainment or other public venues  may significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties  and motorsports events and other business risks 
we may increase our self insurance limits which could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number of incidents  damages  causalities or other claims below such self insured limits increase 
while management believes it has reasonable self insurance limits in place  management can not guarantee that the number of uninsured losses will not increase 
an increase in the number of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations 
litigation costs 
as discussed in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various litigation for which significant legal costs were incurred in fiscal we intend to defend vigorously against the claims raised in existing legal actions  and will likely incur significant legal costs in fiscal we are presently unable to quantify the amount of these expected legal costs  and new or changes in pending or threatened legal action against us could result in further increases in legal costs 
significant factors in the following are significant factors that affected our financial condition and results of operations in the year ended december  general factors 
operating results for fiscal were negatively impacted by public concerns over travel  difficult economic conditions and national security incidents 
reduced consumer and corporate spending at several of our major racing events negatively impacted attendance with related effects on event related revenue 
such spending also impacted the demand for souvenir  apparel and other merchandise at non event company and outside venues  with related effects on event related and other operating revenues 
complaint against oil chem research corp 
on january   the federal trade commission filed a complaint against smi and oil chem seeking a judgment to enjoin smi and oil chem from advertising zmax power system for use in motor vehicles and to award equitable relief to redress alleged injury to consumers 
in march  this matter was settled with refund payments aggregating million plus associated expenses 
while the outcome of this lawsuit had no material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  we incurred significant legal costs in defending this action 
senior subordinated notes redemption and bank credit facility replacement 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and below in liquidity and capital resources  in june  the company redeemed and retired all outstanding former senior subordinated notes with proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes and our current bank credit facility the credit facility and from cash investments on hand 
the proceeds from the senior subordinated notes  along with the credit facility and cash investments on hand  were used to repay and retire then outstanding borrowings under the former senior subordinated notes and former credit facility  fund redemption premium  accrued interest  commissions  fees and other transaction costs  fund capital expenditures and for working capital needs 
the net redemption premium  associated unamortized net deferred loan costs  unamortized original issuance premium and recognition of a previously deferred gain from an interest rate swap termination payment  and transaction costs  all associated with the existing debt arrangements  aggregated approximately million  after income taxes  and was reflected as a charge to earnings in the second quarter the charge reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for by 
declaration of cash dividend 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per share of common stock which aggregated approximately million paid on november  to shareholders of record as of october  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and other debt and equity offerings 
we expended significant amounts of cash in for improvements and expansion at our speedway facilities 
significant changes in our financial condition and liquidity during resulted primarily from net cash generated by operations amounting to million  cash outlays for payments of debt redemption premium and debt issuance costs of million  cash outlays for capital expenditures amounting to million  and payment of an annual cash dividend amounting to million 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and had million in outstanding borrowings under the million revolving credit facility under which we could borrow up to an additional million 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
while primarily representing the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  the likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as further discussed in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  we had the following contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total current years years thereafter contractual cash obligations current liabilities  excluding current maturities of long term debt and deferred race event income long term debt  including current maturities payable to affiliate other liabilities operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitment expiration by period total current years years thereafter other commercial commitments letters of credit  total other commercial commitments contractual cash obligations above exclude a interest payments under our debt obligations  including the senior subordinated notes and the credit facility 
in  cash paid for interest  net of amounts capitalized  was approximately million  b income taxes that may be paid in future years 
in  cash paid for income taxes was approximately million  and c any impact for likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities when reversal occurs 
includes required annual principal payments under our term loan of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in we presently do not have any significant off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations 
we anticipate that cash from operations and funds available through the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs at least through  including planned capital expenditures and payment of any future dividends that may be declared 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  we may  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
we may  from time to time  redeem or retire our debt securities  and purchase our debt and equity securities  depending on liquidity  prevailing market conditions  and such factors as permissibility under the credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
while we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from our existing speedway operations  and have generally experienced improvement in our financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  additional liquidity resources  as well as possibly others  could be needed to fund our continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of our speedway and other facilities

the credit facility  as more fully described below  consists of a revolving credit facility with an overall borrowing limit of million  and separate sub limits of million for standby letters of credit and for day swing line loans  and a million five year term loan 
the net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes  together with borrowings under the credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand  were used to fully redeem  in june  the company s million in aggregate principal amount former senior subordinated notes  including the payment of redemption premium and accrued interest  refinance borrowings under the former credit facility  and pay related fees and expenses associated with the redemption and refinancing 
the company s management  including the board of directors  believes such debt redemption and replacement transactions were in the company s long term interest based on the favorable interest rate environment and previously scheduled maturity of the former credit facility in may the refinancing of the former credit facility and the former senior subordinated notes extend the company s senior and subordinated debt maturities  and management believes the refinancings provide additional financial and operational flexibility 
all borrowings outstanding under the former senior subordinated notes and former credit facility were replaced and funded with the issuance of new long term debt 
the net redemption premium  associated unamortized net deferred loan costs  unamortized original issuance premium and recognition of a previously deferred gain from an interest rate swap termination payment  and transaction costs  all associated with the existing debt arrangements  aggregated approximately million  after income taxes  and were reflected as a charge to earnings in the second quarter the charge reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for by the senior subordinated notes were issued at par  and net proceeds after commissions and fees approximated million 
such proceeds  along with borrowings of million under the new replacement revolving credit facility and the new million term loan  and cash and cash equivalents on hand were used to repay and retire then outstanding borrowings under the former senior subordinated notes and former credit facility 
until the former senior subordinated notes were redeemed  the company utilized net proceeds from the sale of the senior subordinated notes to repay outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under the former credit facility and invested in short term  fixed income securities

table of contents capital expenditures significant growth in our revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects 
at december   we had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and make other site improvements at our speedways 
our multi year reconfiguration and modernization of ir is substantially finished  with completion presently scheduled for in  we began construction at lvms of approximately  new permanent seats  and began renovating and modernizing lms s infield garages  media center  scoring towers and other facilities  completion of which is presently scheduled for similar to prior years  the company continues to expand concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans at several of its speedways 
the company also plans to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow particularly at ir  and at other company speedways 
projects 
as discussed above  in  ir s multi year reconfiguration and modernization was substantially finished  and lvms began construction of approximately  new permanent seats  with completion presently scheduled for in march  bms completed construction of approximately  new permanent grandstand seats for a net increase of approximately  including new luxury suites  featuring new stadium style seating  outstanding views  convenient elevator access and popular food courts 
similar to prior years  we continued to expand concessions  restrooms and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans at several of our speedways 
we also continued to improve and expand on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow particularly at ir  and at our other speedways 
the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in will approximate million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
we also continually evaluate new opportunities that will add value for our stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of our existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility allows for payment of dividends and repurchase of smi securities aggregating up to million annually  increasable in future years subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million which was paid on november  to shareholders of record as of october  the annual cash dividend was paid using available cash and cash investments 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
table of contents financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe our critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change include the following recoverability of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have net property and equipment of million  and net goodwill and other intangible assets of million  as of december  as discussed in recently issued accounting standards below and note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets under which we assessed initial impairment under transitional rules as of january  the cumulative effect of the accounting change for goodwill impairment associated with certain non motorsports related reporting units reduced fiscal year net income approximately million  net of income taxes of  we periodically evaluate long lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows and profitability attributable to such assets or when indications of possible impairment occur 
the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
while we believe no impairment exists at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
included in property and equipment are condominiums located at two company speedways with carrying values of million  and in noncurrent other assets is land for development with a carrying value of million  as of december  although management is in the process of developing and marketing the property  these assets were reclassified under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as management is presently unable to determine if sale of these assets is probable within one year 
the carrying value of the speedway condominiums held for sale is supported by market prices of recent condominium sales 
the carrying value of land for development is supported by independent appraisal and market prices of comparable properties 
while we believe the carrying value of such property is fully recoverable  changes in local and regional real estate markets  including zoning and other land use laws  and motorsports industry interest  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the property s market value and our financial condition or future results of operations 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of million and net intangible assets of million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
we believe the estimated useful lives we use to record depreciation and amortization expense are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment  and to a lesser degree  intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our financial condition or future results of operations 
revenue recognition for our racing events 
we recognize admissions  nascar broadcasting and other event related revenues when an event is held 
advance revenues and certain related direct expenses pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held 
deferred expenses primarily include race purses and sanctioning fees remitted to nascar or other sanctioning bodies and sales and admission taxes and credit card processing fees on advance revenues 
deferred race event income relates to scheduled events to be held in upcoming periods 
if circumstances prevent a race from being held during the racing season generally advance revenue is refundable and all deferred direct event expenses would be immediately recognized except for race purses and sanction fees which would be refundable from nascar or other sanctioning bodies  and for sales and admission taxes which would be refundable from taxing authorities 
we believe this accounting policy results in appropriate recognition and matching of revenues and expenses associated with our racing events and helps ensure comparability and consistency between our financial statements 
we believe our revenue recognition polices follow the guidance issued in sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
realization of receivables and inventories 
we assess realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories  using  among other things  customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience  and current and future market demand  trends and conditions 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 

table of contents income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
our accounting for income taxes reflects our assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
a valuation allowance of million was provided against deferred tax assets as of december  we believe realization of the deferred tax assets  after reduction for the valuation allowance  is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 
legal proceedings and contingencies 
as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and we intend to continue to defend ourselves in existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties and motorsports events  as discussed above in near term operating factors insurance coverage  and other business risks 
we accrue a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on matters related to litigation  outside consultants  historical trends  and assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
we believe amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we do not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against us  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and our financial condition or future results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we continue to account for stock based employee compensation using accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of equity instruments awarded as permitted under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as all stock options granted under our stock option plans have exercise prices equal to market value of the underlying common stock at grant date  no compensation cost has been reflected in net income for these plans 
as discussed below in recently issued accounting standards  we have applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb no 
in the consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share had compensation cost for stock options been determined using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
is illustrated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  smi s stock option plan will expire by its terms on december  in february  the smi board of directors adopted a new stock incentive plan the plan subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders on april  awards under the plan may be in the form of incentive stock options  non statutory stock options or restricted stock 
approval of the plan will not amend or modify the plan 
smi will continue to have the right to grant stock options in accordance with the terms of the plan until its expiration in december approval of the plan  and termination of the plan  will not adversely affect rights under any outstanding stock options previously granted under the plan 
under the proposed plan   shares of smi s common stock will be reserved for issuance subject to various restrictions and adjustments including no more than  shares of restricted stock awards may be granted  no individual may be granted options aggregating more than  shares of common stock during any calendar year  and for restricted stock awards designated as performance awards  no individual may be granted an aggregate of more than  shares of common stock during any calendar year 
the company may be required to recognize compensation cost for restricted stock awards  if any  using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
any compensation cost is not determinable until such time that restricted stock award amounts  prices and vesting provisions  among other factors  are known 
the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec continue to evaluate the appropriate treatment of employee stock options  including efforts to reach a consensus on proper methodology for expensing and valuing options 
future accounting standards may require that net income and earnings per share reflect compensation cost for stock options determined using fair value recognition provisions 
such future changes in accounting standards  depending on numerous factors including  among others  market conditions and prices for our common stock  the number of options granted  exercised or cancelled  or the sensitivity and fluctuation in assumptions used in valuation methods  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in january  fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities was issued which  among other things  provides guidance on identifying variable interest entities vie and determining when assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and operating results of a vie should be included in a company s consolidated financial statements  and also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin fin r to clarify certain provisions and exempt certain entities from its requirements 
we presently do not hold an interest in a variable interest entity  therefore  initial application of fin and fin r did not affect our financial statements or disclosures 
in april  sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities under sfas no 
it requires  among other things  that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly and clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective generally for contracts entered into and modified after june  sfas no 
did not impact our accounting for derivative instruments in we will assess the impact  if any  sfas no 
may have on our financial statements or disclosures upon entering into any applicable derivative instruments 
in may  sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity was issued to improve the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity  and requires classification of those instruments as liabilities in statements of financial position 
it affects  among other things  the accounting for generally three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatory redeemable shares  put options and forward purchase contracts  and obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of a company s shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in financial instruments that are not derivatives in entirety 
sfas no 
is effective generally for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for the first interim period beginning after june  we had no financial instruments subject to sfas no 
at december   and will assess the impact on our financial statements or disclosures  if any  upon entering into any such instruments 
we periodically evaluate the possible effects of sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information on our financial statement disclosures 
our motorsports related operations comprise one operating segment  and encompass all admissions  event related  nascar broadcasting  and certain other operating revenues and associated expenses 
our other operations comprising non motorsports related activities presently are not significant relative to those of motorsports related operations 
as such  at this time  sfas no 
continues to have no effect on our financial statement disclosures 
environmental matters lms s property includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the lms property ceased in there is one lcid landfill currently being permitted at lms  however  to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the lms property were closed in lms intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the lms property in the future 
prior to  lms leased certain property to allied for use as c d landfill  which received solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but could not receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
the lms c d landfill is now closed 
in addition  allied owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to lms 
we believe the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
we also believe our operations  including the landfills and facilities on our property  are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we are not aware of any situations related to landfill operations which we expect would materially adversely affect our financial position or future results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our financial instruments with market risk exposure consist only of notes receivable  bank revolving credit facility borrowings  the term loan under the credit facility and two interest rate swaps that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates of one percent on notes receivable and debt balances outstanding at december   excluding the interest rate swaps  would cause a change in annual interest income of approximately  and annual interest expense of approximately  
table of contents as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s two interest rate swap transactions are separately designated as fair value and cash flow hedges of underlying fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
the swaps have principal notional amounts of million  provide for settlement every six months beginning on december   and expire in june and june corresponding with the underlying hedged debt terms
