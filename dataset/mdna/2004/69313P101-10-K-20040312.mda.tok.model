item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of pab should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  and is qualified in its entirety by the foregoing and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere 
historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included  and any trends which may appear to be inferred  should not be taken as being necessarily indicative of trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods 
we have made  and will continue to make  various forward looking statements with respect to financial and business matters 
comments regarding our business which are not historical facts are considered forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements 
for additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures  see the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report 
overview of key financial  strategic and performance factors our operating subsidiary  the park avenue bank  is a million community bank with locations in georgia and florida 
we have offices in both smaller  rural communities as well as larger  metropolitan communities 
we provide traditional banking products and services to both commercial and individual customers in our markets 
for additional information on our markets  see the markets and competition section in part i of this report 
as a bank  we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our primary objective is to accept deposits and borrow additional funds as needed at low costs and invest those funds in a safe and sound manner in loans and investments at a higher yield in order to increase the return on our stockholders investment 
competition  regulation  credit risk  and interest rate risk are the primary factors that we must ma nage in order to be successful 
in terms of profitability  our return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe for was and  respectively 
this is an improvement over when we recorded an roa of and an roe of 
for  our net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  recorded in the primary reasons for the improvement in our profitability are discussed more fully under results of operations below 
during  we entered into new markets in athens  georgia  and st 
augustine  florida by opening loan production offices 
we believe we have opportunities to grow in these two markets 
we also reinstated our quarterly dividend payments to our stockholders in this was an important step for us as it was a statement of our belief that we had stabilized our earnings and of our positive outlook for the future 
we have improved our credit quality and our infrastructure to control the lending function 
we now have more than million in loans outstanding in henry county after being in that market for only three years 
likewise  we now have more than million in loans outstanding in hall county after only two years there 
we were voted the best bank in south georgia by readers of the valdosta daily times in this vote of confidence was a great boost in the morale of our employees in the valdosta market following nearly two years of high employee turnover  high credit losses  and low earnings from the flagship bank in our organization 
finally  and most importantly  we were also able to clear a major regulatory hurdle over the credit problems that surfaced in when the federal reserve terminated the resolution in august in  we initiated several strategic changes we had changes in senior management  we began the process of consolidating our six separate bank charters into one  we engaged a new audit firm  and we switched our primary federal bank regulator from the fdic to the federal reserve 
problems with our credit quality and weaknesses in our credit administration began to surface as we implemented these changes 
in addition  as these changes were being made  the economy was in the midst of a recession and terrorists had attacked our country  further stressing the environment that we operated within 
our nonperforming loans rose from million at the beginning of to million at the end of that year 
during the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve began an examination of the bank that led to the identification of many of these problems 
as a result  we provided millio n to the allowance for loan losses during the fourth quarter of that basically negated our earnings for the entire year 
after the conclusion of their examination  on may   the federal reserve required our board of directors to adopt the resolution to improve the financial condition of the bank and correct the weaknesses identified in their examination 
in addition  the resolution restricted us from redeeming our capital stock  paying dividends  modifying existing debt agreements  or incurring additional debt without prior regulatory approval 
over the next fifteen months  little was accomplished that did not relate to addressing the provisions of the resolution 
on august   the federal reserve terminated the resolution with the company 
since the end of  when our credit problems began to surface  our balance sheet has been in a period of contraction 
while part of the decline was due to the work out or charge off of certain loans  we also lost some business to former lenders and our competitors 
in addition  we saw a decline in overall demand for loans with the down turn in the economy 
without the loan demand  we had to reduce our level of deposits in order to stabilize our earnings 
the table below shows our total loans and deposits at the end of each quarter since the end of the third quarter of as well as our net interest income for each of those quarters 
net interest net interest quarter ended loans deposits income margin dollars in thousands shown on a taxable equivalent basis although our loan portfolio has declined million  or  and interest rates have dropped another basis points over the past nine quarters  we have been able to hold our net interest income stable and improve our net interest margin through reductions in interest expense 
loan growth has been positive in our north georgia and florida markets  but not at a pace to replenish the contraction in our south georgia market 
during  loans in north georgia increased million and loans in florida increased million  while loans in south georgia and the treasury mainly out of market participations purchased decreased million 
without any net new loans driving asset growth in  we have reduced the liability side of our balance sheet by allowing time deposits to either roll off the balance sheet or into other deposit accounts at maturity 
time deposits have declined by a net million  or  since december  at the same time  we have continued to focus on building customer relationships and seeking core deposits 
balances in demand and savings accounts excluding million in public tax deposits temporarily on the books at december  remained constant  increasing million  or less than  during with the decline in time deposits  we used secured  short term repurchase agreements as an alternative funding source 
our balance due in repurchase agreements increased million  from million at december  to million at year end 
we intend to gradually convert these short term borrowings back into time deposits or fhlb advances as we see the demand for loans improve 
total stockholders equity increased million  or  during equity was increased primarily from the contribution of million from earnings net of million in dividends paid 
as a percentage of total assets  equity represented at end of  compared to at the beginning of  with the increase resulting from an increase in equity and a decline in assets during the year 
statistical disclosures distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rates and interest differential interest rates remained at near historic lows throughout all of while the lower rate environment resulted in downward repricing of our earning assets  we were also able to continue to reduce the cost of funding those earning assets during the year 
the next two tables illustrate the effects of the decline in interest rates and a decrease in the volume of loans and other earning assets on our interest income during the impact of interest rates and volume on our earnings are more fully discussed under results of operations below 
rate volume analysis the following table shows a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years 
thus  changes that are not solely due to volume have been consistently attributed to rate

our investment portfolio policy stresses quality and liquidity 
the bonds which are purchased as investments carry an a rating or better by either standard and poor s or moody s investors service  inc or have been reviewed for credit and market risk and deemed appropriate for the bank s portfolio by management 
the portfolio is monitored to assure there is no unreasonable concentration of securities in the obligations of a single debtor 
the following table shows the maturities of non equity investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields on a fully taxable basis assuming a tax rate on such securities 
the maturities presented for mortgage backed securities are based on the average lives of those bonds at the then projected prepayment speeds 
actual maturities usually differ from contractual maturities because certain security issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

our growth in residential construction lending in henry county and its surrounding counties was the primary reason for the million increase our construction and development loans during at the end of  we had million in residential construction loans outstanding that were originated from the henry county office

this preference has contributed to our asset sensitive interest rate risk position

included in the group of nonperforming loans left at december   are loans totaling million  or of the total  that are due from three separate borrowers 
two of the three borrowers  whose debts with the bank total million  are farmers whose loans are secured by farmland and agricultural equipment 
the other borrower is in bankruptcy and owes the bank million 
the million troubled debt restructuring included in the table above is due from one customer whose loans were restructured through bankruptcy 
the loans are secured by commercial real estate and have been performing under the restructured terms 
included in nonperforming loans at the beginning of  were loans totaling million due from one commercial borrower 
these loans were partially guaranteed by the u 
s 
department of agriculture the usda 
we wrote off the unguaranteed portions of these loans in december when it became apparent the borrower could no longer adequately service the debt 
in september  after an unsuccessful effort to collect the loans from the borrower  the remaining balance of these loans were charged off and a formal claim was filed with the usda for a recovery of the guaranteed portion plus uncollected interest and legal and collection fees 
our claim was officially denied by the usda in the fourth quarter of  and to date  attempts to settle our claim through mediation have been unsuccessful 
we may continue to pursue a recovery through the courts if necessary  but at this time  we can provide no assurances as to the timing or amount of a recovery  if any 
through the end of  we have spent approximately  in legal fees on this matter 
at december   we had million in total delinquent loans loans past due days or more  or of total loans 
this is a significant decrease from one year ago and a high of at march  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when  in our judgment  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due  unless the loan is well secured 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received until the loan is returned to accrual status 
for the year ended december   the gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonperforming loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately  the amount of interest income on the above nonperforming loans that was included in net income for the year ended december  was approximately  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was at december   compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses related to our nonperforming loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance as a percent of total loans was  compared to at december  we consider the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio 
as an integral part of our credit risk management process  we regularly review loans in our portfolio for credit quality and documentation of collateral 
the lenders are primarily responsible for assigning a risk grade to each loan in their portfolio 
their assessments are supplemented with independent reviews conducted by our internal audit department and external loan review consultants 
all loans in excess of  that have been identified for potential credit weakness are reviewed quarterly by a management committee to further enhance the process for timely recognition of losses and for determining appropriate reserves 
we have a comprehensive methodology for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
we perform an allowance analysis at least quarterly that is broken down into three components specific allowances for individual loans  allowances for pools of loans identified by credit risk grades or delinquency status  and general allowances for all other loans pooled by loan type 
a management committee has the responsibility for assessing the risk elements  determining the specific allowance valuations  and affirming the methodology used 
the board of directors reviews management s assessment and affirms the amount recorded 
the first component of the allowance for loan loss methodology covers the measurement of specific allowances for individual impaired loans as required by sfas no 
individual loans with amounts due in excess of  that have been identified for potential credit weakness are evaluated for impairment 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
by definition  we consider all loans on nonaccrual status and all loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring as impaired 
if impairment is determined  a specific valuation is assessed on that loan based on realizable collateral values if collateral dependent  discounted cash flows  or observable market values 
at december   we had million in specif ic reserves on million in individually evaluated impaired loans 
that is a slight increase over the million in specific reserves assessed on million in identified impaired loans at december the second component of the allowance for loan loss methodology addresses all loans not individually evaluated for impairment but are either internally rated  criticized by our banking examiners  or past due day or more 
the allowance factors are based on industry standards and supported by our own historical loss analysis 
at december   we had million in general reserves allocated to million rated and delinquent loans 
this is a million decrease from the million reserved on million rated and delinquent loans at december  the decrease is due to improvement in the more severe rating categories over the past twelve months 
the third component addresses general allowances on all loans not individually reserved due to impairment  rating or delinquency status 
these loans are divided into smaller homogenous groups based on loan type 
the allowances are determined by applying loss factors to each pool of loans with similar characteristics 
the factors used are based on the three year historical loss percentages for each pool adjusted by current known and documented internal and external environmental factors 
the environmental factors considered in developing our loss measurements include levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the quantitative risk factors used in determining these general reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
at december   we had million in general reserves compared to million one year ago 
while we have seen improving trends in may of the environmental factors  the general reserve increased slightly over last year primarily due to additional caution taken into consideration for our increased concentration in residential construction lending and our entering into new markets 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
while we use the best information available to make the evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or other environmental factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses  and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
summary of loan loss experience the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses  the average balance of loans outstanding  and the ratio of net losses experienced for each of the last five years

allocation of the allowance for loan losses we have allocated the allowance for credit losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary at each year end to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

amount in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six months through one year over one year total with a continued decline in loan volume in  we elected not to compete aggressively for time deposits of  or more 
within our portfolio of time deposits  those with balances of  or more decreased by million  or  during the year 
other time deposits also declined as we continued to lower our offering rates during the year and depositors moved into interest bearing demand and savings accounts 
along with the decrease in volume  the average rate paid on time deposits dropped basis points from in to in the decrease in both volume and rate on these deposits allowed us to improve our net interest margin and keep our net interest income from falling to a less profitable level 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in our financial condition and affects our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment securities  are funded by customer deposits  borrowed funds  and retained earnings 
maturities in the investment and loan portfolios also provide a steady flow of funds for reinvestment 
in addition  our liquidity continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable core deposit base and the availability of additional funding sources 
at december   our liquidity ratio was and our net noncore funding dependency ratio was 
our liquidity and funding policy provides that we should maintain a liquidity position of greater than or equal to and a net noncore funding dependency ratio of less than or equal to 
since year end we are aware of no trends or events likely to result in a material change in our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
investment portfolio the bank s investment portfolio is another primary source of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds that are available for cash needs 
contractual investment securities that mature within one year total million 
however  mortgage backed securities and securities with call provisions create cash flows earlier than the contractual maturities 
estimates of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and call provisions on federal agency and state and municipals increase the forecasted cash flows from the investment portfolio 
our liquidity from investments is somewhat limited since we pledge certain investments to secure public deposits  certain borrowing arrangements  and for other purposes 
at december   approximately of our million investment portfolio was pledged as collateral to others 
borrowings as with most community banks  loan volume is the driver for the remainder of our balance sheet 
since our loan volume has been down  we have not been aggressive in retaining time deposits 
as a result  time deposits in total have decreased million  or  since december  and we have repaid million in advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb as they matured 
in addition  we repaid million in fhlb advances in the third quarter of that had a remaining average life to maturity of over five years and incurred a million prepayment penalty 
the average rate on these advances was basis points higher than the current federal funds rate that we purchased to retire the advances 
our calculations indicate that we should achieve a significant savings in interest expense over the next five years due to paying off these advan ces 
during the second quarter of  we executed two leverage strategies totaling million to take advantage of low short term interest rates and provide attractive margins even as we expect to move into a tightening cycle later in the first million was used in an amortizing leverage strategy where we acquired mortgage backed securities with million in advances from the fhlb 
the remaining million was used in a liability sensitive leverage strategy where we purchased a callable agency bond with a million repurchase agreement 
on november   pab bankshares capital trust i pab trust issued million of floating rate capital securities  also referred to as trust preferred securities 
we formed pab trust  a statutory business trust created under the laws of the state of delaware  for the sole purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by us 
the interest rates on both the trust preferred securities and the debentures are reset semi annually at libor plus currently with a rate cap of through december  we entered into agreements which  taken collectively  fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee  on a subordinated basis  all of pab trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
pab trust s sole asset is the debentures issued by us 
the debentures will mature on december   but are callable at par at our option in whole or in part anytime after december  the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
at december   we had million in an available credit line with the fhlb and an additional million in unsecured fed funds lines of credit available with correspondent banks 
contractual obligations summarized below are our contractual obligations as of december  less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands fhlb advances operating lease obligations guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in debentures trust preferred securities off balance sheet financing our financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these financial instruments are included in the financial statements when funds are distributed or the instruments become payable 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to extend credit through open lines of credit of approximately million and outstanding standby letters of cr edit of approximately million 
commitments of capital at december   there are no binding commitments for material capital expenditures outstanding 
stockholders equity we are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our regulatory agencies 
see the section titled capital adequacy under supervision and regulation in item of this document for more information on the regulatory capital adequacy standards 
the following table summarizes our consolidated regulatory capital ratios at december   and minimum regulatory requirement total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets leverage ratio results of operations net interest income the primary component of a financial institution s profitability is net interest income  or the difference between the interest income earned on assets  primarily loans and investments  and interest paid on liabilities  primarily deposits and other borrowed funds 
our net interest income for  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased by  or  over interest income decreased million  or  while interest expense decreased by million  or  during the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of a basis point drop in the average yield on earning assets during the year  from in to in the majority of the decrease in interest expense is also the result of a decline in rates 
the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  from in to in net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  for increased by million  or  over the increase in from was the result of the combination of both a million decrease in the volume of average earning assets  accompanied by the basis point drop in the average yield on those earning assets for the same period and a million  or decrease in the volume of average earning liabilities  accompanied by the basis point decrease in the average rate paid on those funds 
the net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
our net interest margin increased from in to in  a basis point improvement 
although our net interest margin improved during  our ability to continue to improve our net interest margin going forward will be a challenge as long as interest rates hold at or slide even lower than the current levels 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through the provision  we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on growth in the loan portfolio  changes in economic conditions and other internal and external environmental factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december   there was no provision for loan losses recorded  compared to million for the same period in the decline is due to a shrinking loan portfolio  an improvement in the level of total nonperforming loans  and an improvement in several environmental factors previously discussed 
based on our assessments of the allowance for loan losses during  no provision was needed

service charges on deposit accounts dropped slightly from to as we continued to promote a free checking product  thus reducing the monthly service fees 
the fee income generated from an overdraft privilege product that was launched in march and resulted in an increase in revenues that year also tapered off in both and mortgage origination fees dropped in due to a decrease in the refinancing activity during the year 
if the demand for refinancing slows during  we expect our mortgage origination fee income to decline as well 
brokerage income decreased in during the fourth year of that operation 
in february  the bank entered into a new agreement with a third party to provide brokerage services for our customers 
under this new agreement  the bank s brokerage income will decrease  however  the brokerage expenses associated with providing these services under the old agreement will no longer be incurred 
we had   and  in brokerage expenses that is included in noninterest expense in  and  respectively 
fee income from atm and debit cards increased in as the volume of point of sale transactions has continued to increase from previous years 
gains on securities transactions increased nearly million in there was a million gain on the sale of stock in community financial services  inc in no earnings were recorded from our equity investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary in or because we sold our equity interest in december for a gain of approximately million 
in we recorded a  gain on the sale of our branch office in richmond hill  georgia 
also in  we recognized a  write down on the impairment of a branch office in ocala  florida based on an updated appraisal  which failed to support the carrying value

excluding this loss  noninterest expense would have totaled million  or of average assets for the increase in salaries and wages is the net result of annual raises and promotions offset by a decline in the number of employees from full time equivalents at the end of to at the end of deferred loan cost  a credit against salaries and wages  decreased  from and resulted in an increase in expense reported during  compared to the period ending december  the decline in the deferral of loan costs is due to a decline in loan volume experienced during compared to employee benefits increased due primarily to an increase in health insurance premiums 
occupancy expense increased in due to the addition of new facilities and an increase in property taxes  insurance  and utilities 
furniture and equipment expense decreased in due primarily to a  decrease in depreciation expense 
legal and accounting fees decreased by in during we experienced an increase in legal fees for the collection and recovery of problem loans and regulatory matters 
all other major expense categories have decreased due to efficiencies gained from the charter consolidation process  the utilization of technology  and tighter budgeting and cost control measures

we cope with the effects of inflation through managing our interest rate sensitivity gap position  by periodically reviewing and adjusting our pricing of services to consider current costs  and through managing our dividend payout policy relative to our level of income 
there has been minimal inflation experienced in the last three years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and the related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions which effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that our determination of the allowance for loan losses and the fair value of assets  including the impairment of goodwill  affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are described in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements provided in item of this report 
the follow ing is a brief description of the company s critical accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgment 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors including  but not limited to  reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on segments of the loan portfolio  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on either the fair value of the underlying collateral  the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  or the estimated market value of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg  discount rate and methodologies eg  comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
management s assessment is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
changes in various internal and external environmental factors including  but not limited to  the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  or the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
should these environmental factors change  a different amount may be reported for the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimates of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  other real estate owned  and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates  or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 
recent accounting pronouncements in management s opinion  there are no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material impact on pab s earnings or financial position as of or for the year ended december  for more detailed disclosure on recent accounting developments  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  we manage our exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not engage in trading activity nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly held pass through securities 
finally  we have no material direct exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is our policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon between and 
however  with interest rates at historic lows and the shape of the interest rate curve  the company has exceeded policy limits by adjusting the balance sheet to a more asset sensitive position 
at december   our one year management adjusted gap ratio of was outside of our policy guidelines due to our preference to offer floating rate loans over fixed rate loans at this t ime 
this exception to policy  while monitored closely  is an acceptable risk that positions our financial condition to benefit from an increase in interest rates 
the table below has two measures of gap  regulatory and management adjusted 
the regulatory gap considers only contractual maturities or repricings 
the management adjusted gap includes assumptions regarding prepayment speeds on certain rate sensitive assets  the repricing frequency of interest bearing demand and savings accounts  and the stability of core deposit levels  all of which are adjusted periodically as market conditions change 
the management adjusted gap indicates we are highly asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates in the short term 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
cumulative repricing gap analysis month month year dollars in thousands regulatory defined rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl rsa minus rsl gap gap ratio rsa rsl management adjusted rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl rsa minus rsl gap gap ratio rsa rsl we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining  and flat interest rate scenarios allows us to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to increases or decreases in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
as of year end  the simulation model projected net interest income would increase over the next year if market rates immediately rose by basis points 
on the other hand  the model projected net interest income to decrease over the next year if market rates immediately fell by basis points 
the high volatility in our results is due primarily to our asset sensitive balance sheet mix and o ur behavioral assumptions for repricing and prepayment speeds 
our policy states that net interest income cannot be reduced by more than using this analysis  and technically  we were outside of policy guidelines at year end 
however  this exception was mitigated because a further basis point drop was not realistic given that the federal funds rate stood at 
if market rates immediately fell by basis points  a more plausible but still unlikely scenario  our model projected net interest income to decrease over the next year 
the following table shows the results of these projections for net interest income expressed as a percentage change over net interest income in a flat rate scenario for both a gradual change in market interest rates over a twelve month period and an immediate change  or shock  in market interest rates
