overview background we are a leading provider of software and services for end to end business integration solutions 
we offer a set of software products that enable organizations to run  manage and optimize their business 
our software products and related services give organizations the ability  seamlessly and in real time  to integrate disparate information resources  to connect customers  vendors and business partners with the organization and its employees  to view and manage the connected information resources  data  business processes and human workflows and to provide web services at the enterprise level 
in august  webmethods acquired active software  inc active software in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we have combined our financial statements for prior periods as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of all prior periods presented 
we completed acquisitions of business and technology in october to significantly expand our portfolio of products in the service oriented architecture soa  business activity monitoring bam and portal spaces 
the aggregate acquisition cost for these three acquisitions was approximately million in cash 
from the technology acquired in those acquisitions  we introduced webmethods fabric  webmethods glue  webmethods optimize and webmethods portal 
with the addition of those products  continued organic development from our product development team  and several key partnerships  webmethods offers a solution that represents the next generation of integration technology and provides our customers with a breadth of functionality that we believe is compelling 
and while each one of the technologies represented in our solution is  in and of itself  significant and important to our customers  it is the combined breadth and strength of these technologies and the natural synergies between them that drive further value and return on investment to our customers 

table of contents we license our software and sell our services primarily through our direct sales organization augmented by other sales channels  including our strategic software vendor partners  major system integrators with whom we have strategic alliances  other partners and distributors and  to a lesser extent  resellers 
we license our software primarily on a perpetual basis and  to a lesser extent  on a renewable term basis 
as of march   we had over  customers  compared to over customers as of march  we believe one of our competitive differentiators is our strategic partnerships with enterprise application software companies and system integrators 
under our partnerships with enterprise application software vendors  the partner may resell or  in some instances  embed or otherwise utilize our software with their applications under limited use licenses for a license or royalty fee 
enterprise application software vendors with whom we have relationships include american management systems ams  hewlett packard company  informatica  i technologies  microsoft  peoplesoft and siebel systems 
we believe our partners influenced  directly or indirectly  a significant portion of our license revenue during fiscal year  and we expect this leverage to continue in future periods 
under certain partnership arrangements  we may share license fees derived from joint selling opportunities with our partner 
in systems integrator and other partnership arrangements  we may pay a sales assistance fee to a partner who performs or assists in certain sales activities  and that fee usually is paid once payment from the joint customer of license fees is received 
we believe our strong focus and track record of ensuring that our software is successfully put into production production event is a strong competitive advantage and differentiator 
during fiscal year  our global customer services group reported and documented more than separate production events as compared to such events in fiscal year and such events in fiscal year ensuring that our customers successfully implement our software in a timely manner enables them to achieve a greater return on their investment and  in many cases  encourages them to purchase additional software for other business integration projects and serve as a reference customer for us in our future sales efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to allowances for bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ for these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements  which may include the sale of licenses of our software  professional services and maintenance or various combinations of each element 
we recognize revenue based on 
table of contents statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop modified sop by requiring revenue to be recognized using the residual method if certain conditions are met 
revenue is recognized based on the residual method when an agreement has been signed by both parties  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable  delivery of the product has occurred  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undelivered element  and no other significant obligations remain 
revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
judgments we make regarding these items  including collection risk  can materially impact the timing of recognition of license revenue 
policies related to revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
these sources may publish new authoritative guidance which might impact current revenue recognition policies 
we continue to evaluate our revenue recognition policies as new authoritative interpretations and guidance are published  and where appropriate  may modify our revenue recognition policies 
application of our revenue recognition policy requires a review of our license and professional services agreements with customers and may require management to exercise judgment in evaluating whether delivery has occurred  payments are fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and where applicable  if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements of the contract 
in the event judgment in the application of our revenue recognition policies is incorrect  the revenue recognized by webmethods could be impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments to us 
these allowances are established through analysis of the credit worthiness of each customer with a receivable balance  determined by credit reports from third parties  published or publicly available financial information  customers specific experience including payment practices and history  inquiries  and other financial information from our customers 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at march  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engaged independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and ipr d projects  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents goodwill and intangibles assets we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire other businesses 
the allocation of acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill involves the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of the allocation process can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
financial accounting standards board no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which was issued during fiscal year and adopted by us on april   eliminated the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized under sfas  but are periodically tested for impairment 
in accordance with sfas  all of our goodwill is associated with our corporate reporting unit  as we do not have multiple reporting units 
on an annual basis  we will evaluate whether an impairment of the goodwill may exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
acquired in process research and development costs to acquire in process research and development technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred see note  business acquisitions 
foreign currency effects the functional currency for our foreign operations is the local currency 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into united states dollars 
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expense accounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the gains and losses associated with the translation of the financial statements resulting from the changes in exchange rates from period to period have been reported in other comprehensive income or loss 
to the extent assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are realized or the foreign operations are expected to pay back the intercompany debt in the foreseeable future  amounts previously reported in other comprehensive income or loss would be included in net income or loss in the period in which the transaction occurs 
transaction gains or losses are included in net income or loss in the period in which they occur 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a tax valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring and related charges we have recorded restructuring costs to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
these restructuring plans resulted in a reduction in headcount and consolidation of facilities through the closing of excess offices 
our restructuring costs included accruals for the estimated loss on facilities that we intend to sublease based on estimates of the timing and amount of sublease income 
we reassess this liability each period based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future period if anticipated events and key 
table of contents assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either change or do not materialize 
litigation and contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted

additionally  we entered the first quarter of fiscal year with our quota bearing sales headcount down approximately  which resulted in lower than anticipated americas license revenue  particularly in the first half of the year 
the decrease in license revenue in fiscal year was partially offset by an increase in maintenance and professional services revenue 
in addition  during the last three quarters of fiscal  license and total revenue increased sequentially in each quarter  both in the americas and on a worldwide consolidated basis 
our net loss increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due  primarily  to a decrease in license revenue  an increase in professional services costs  the addition of in process research and development and intangibles amortization related to the acquisitions in october and the settlement of an intellectual property matter in march our net loss decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due  primarily  to the cessation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  reduced sales and marketing costs  lower charges for impairment of equity investments and reduced restructuring and related charges

total revenue included a million positive foreign currency impact from certain international markets in fiscal year  which had minimal impact on operating margins because total cost of revenue and operating expenses in fiscal year were negatively impacted by approximately million due to foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  license revenue and total revenue increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters of our fiscal year  both in the americas and on a worldwide consolidated basis 
these increases in the last two quarters of fiscal year were due in part to sales of the products we acquired in connection with the three acquisitions completed in october professional services revenue increased by million  or  to million  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume and or size of customer engagements  the increased use of subcontractors and  to a lesser extent  a million positive foreign currency impact 
in fiscal year  professional services revenue decreased  to million  from million in fiscal year maintenance revenue increased million  or  from million to million in fiscal year  and million  or  from million to million in fiscal year this increase is due primarily to the increase in customers licensing our software and the cumulative effect of agreements for post contract maintenance and support  which is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
additionally  more customers have moved to our x support plans given the mission critical nature of their integration projects 
furthermore  the increase in maintenance revenue was partially due to a million foreign currency impact

this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue as a percent of total revenue  an increase in the total cost of professional services and maintenance as compared to fiscal year and an increase in cost of revenue due to amortization of intangibles of million related to the october acquisitions 
our cost of license revenue consists of royalties for products embedded in our software licensed from third parties 
in addition  we acquired certain technology in fiscal year that resulted in amortization of intangibles in the amount of million  which is included in our license margin 
accordingly  our gross profit on license revenue was approximately in fiscal year  as compared to in fiscal years and our cost of professional services and maintenance consists primarily of costs related to internal professional services and support personnel  and subcontractors hired to provide implementation and support services 
our gross profit on maintenance and services  excluding stock based compensation  was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively

table of contents operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and warrant charge  amortization of goodwill and intangibles and restructuring and related charges  totaled million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in those operating expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to our intense focus on expense management following a restructuring in fiscal year we increasingly focused on expense management and reduced our quarterly fiscal year operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and warrant charge and restructuring and related charges  by  from million in the first fiscal quarter to million in the fourth fiscal quarter

this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective july  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we maintain our funds in money market accounts  corporate bonds  commercial paper  treasury notes and agency notes 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our interest earnings on our cash deposits 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing as of march   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risks 
however  we do have an investment policy that would allow us to invest in short term and long term investments such as money market instruments and corporate debt securities 
our policy attempts to reduce such risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than twenty four months with a maximum average maturity to our whole portfolio of such investments at twelve months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries located in australia  canada  united kingdom  france  germany  japan  the netherlands  south korea  hong kong  malaysia and singapore 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past  and there is no hedging activity on foreign currencies 
we would not experience a material foreign exchange loss based on a hypothetical adverse change in the price of the euro  great britain pound  singapore dollar  australian dollar  malaysian ringgit  south korean won  canadian dollar or japanese yen against the us dollar 
consequently  we do not expect that a reduction in the value of such accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the direct effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  and the indirect effects of fluctuations in foreign currency could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the us foreign and global economics  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition results of operations and cash flows
