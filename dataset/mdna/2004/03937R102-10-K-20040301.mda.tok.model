the company operates in three segments treatment products  microelectronic materials and performance products 
the company has focused its resources on the treatment products and the microelectronic materials segments  and during the past year divested several non strategic businesses  which included the sulfuric acid business and the hickson organics business in castleford  england 
in  the company also acquired the remaining share of its water products joint venture in south africa 
arch s treatment products business segment generates approximately of the company s annual sales 
it includes three reportable business units hth water products  personal care and industrial biocides  and wood protection and industrial coatings 
the treatment products segment drives growth by its ability to help customers respond to key regulatory trends aimed at improving the environment or protecting human health and safety 
for example  as a result of the international bans on the use of tributyl tins in marine antifouling paints  the industrial biocides business has been able to seize upon growth opportunities with its environmentally preferable zinc and copper omadine r biocides that are used in marine antifouling paints 
in february  the company announced a voluntary transition from chromated copper arsenate cca to a new generation of wood preservatives for use in non industrial wood products after december  cca is a traditional wood preservative used for the past years to protect treated wood against termites and rotting 
in connection with the transition  the company simultaneously requested the epa s consent to an amendment of its registration for cca  which would limit the approved uses of cca to industrial applications 
although the company views this as a growth opportunity for its wood protection business  a risk exists that new sales of its cca alternative product  wolman r e and tanalith r e  will not replace historical sales of the cca product 
the microelectronic materials segment is a leading global supplier of chemicals and services used to create semiconductor devices and flat panel displays 
the company and its japanese joint venture  fujifilm arch  are capitalizing on the rapid growth in asia of semiconductor and flat panel display production 
the profitability of these market segments has been negatively affected by downward pricing due to gloablization of the materials supply chain 
to minimize the impact of downward pricing the business has significantly reduced its cost structure 
to maximize the benefits of globalization  the business has focused on widening its global reach and by providing new products and services that align with two major market growth trends in the semiconductor and image display industries the switch to advanced copper technology in leading edge semiconductor devices and the rapid growth of semiconductor based image sensors for display production around the globe 
the company s major sales  distribution and production facilities are located in north america  europe and asia 
additional facilities are based in latin america  australia and south africa 
approximately of sales and of total long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are outside the us accordingly  the company has exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
these fluctuations impact the translation of sales  earnings  assets and liabilities from the local functional currency to the us dollar 
operating units outside the us that purchase raw materials in us dollars are also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical success factors for the company include managing its overall global manufacturing facilities to maximize efficiencies in the manufacturing processes  fixing or eliminating unprofitable businesses  reducing overall product sourcing costs and growing the businesses organically and through strategic acquisitions 
in addition  several of its customers generally require that the company demonstrate improved efficiencies  through cost reductions and or price decreases 
finally  the company s continued growth will be based on its ability to develop new products to meet its customers needs 
see results of operations for more details on the factors  which drive year over year performance 
the company has a disciplined acquisition strategy that is aimed at complementing existing strengths and under which all candidates must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria 
first  any acquisition must strengthen the company and be focused on the core business areas 
secondly  any acquisition must be cash accretive in year one and earnings accretive no later than the end of the first year 
lastly  there must be a detailed integration plan established prior to the acquisition 
the company s full year net sales were  million  up approximately from the company benefited from the growth in its core businesses  which is evidenced by the strong demand for biocides used in marine antifouling paints  antidandruff shampoos and building products that deter the growth of mold and mildew 
in  the company has continued to see savings from prior restructuring programs that have been combined with other cost reduction initiatives and have allowed the company to offset rising trends in its pension and other health care costs  as well as continued price pressures 
the company remains focused on reducing costs 
year ended december  compared to sales increased million  or due to favorable foreign exchange approximately six percent  an increase in volumes approximately four percent and higher pricing approximately one percent 
the sales increase attributable to the favorable effect of foreign exchange was principally in the industrial coatings and water products businesses 
sales volumes were higher in the water products business principally due to the aquachlor acquisition approximately million and the industrial biocides business as a result of continued strong demand for biocides used in building products and marine antifouling paint markets 
the increase in sales volumes was partially offset by lower volumes in the performance products segment 
gross margin percentage was and for and  respectively 
the decrease in margin percentage was primarily a result of higher raw material costs in the performance urethanes business and unfavorable pricing in the microelectronics materials segment  partially offset by higher margins in the water products business due to lower manufacturing costs 
margins also increased in the industrial biocides business due to the increased sales volume 
additionally  included in the performance products margins is income for an insurance settlement of million for the reimbursement of past and future repairs and maintenance expense for storm damage at one of the company s manufacturing facilities

amortization expense decreased million 
includes the write off of the assets associated with a cancelled expansion of the hth water products j tm plant of approximately million  offset by a favorable legal decision in a raw material spillage lawsuit of million 
research and development expenses were comparable to primarily due to increased spending in the treatment products segment to support various growth initiatives  which were offset by cost reduction initiatives in the microelectronic materials segment 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies increased million due to favorable operating results of all the joint ventures  in particular the fujifilm arch and planar solutions joint ventures 
operating results of the fujifilm arch joint venture increased due to increased sales of photoresists and color mosaic r used in the fabrication of lcd panels and image sensors and the operating results of the planar solutions joint venture increased due to increased sales of cmp copper slurries used in advanced chip manufacturing processes 
other gains and losses in principally represent the pre tax gain on the sale of excess land of million 
represents the pre tax gain on sales of excess land of million 
restructuring income in includes million for severance costs related to headcount reductions in the performance products segment 
the headcount reductions are due to the reorganization related to the sale of the sulfuric acid business and the temporary idling of the company s hydrazine hydrate plant in lake charles  louisiana 
also includes million of severance costs for additional headcount reductions associated with a revision to the organizational restructuring program  offset by a reduction of the prior years restructuring reserves of million due to revisions to previous plans estimates 
restructuring expense in includes employee related costs for headcount reductions in the microelectronic materials  treatment products and performance products segments and expenses related to the consolidation of several treatment products operations 
the tax rate on income from continuing operations for and was and  respectively

outlook hth water products segment expects continued growth in the hth r poolife r brand sold to the professional pool dealer market 
continued strong demand for the biocides used in marine antifouling paint and antidandruff markets are expected in the personal care and industrial biocides segment 
wood protection is expected to continue to benefit from the conversion to cca alternative products 
the performance products segment is expected to be adversely impacted by rising raw material costs 
as a result of the above factors  the company anticipates sales for the full year will increase approximately eight to ten percent 
earnings per share are expected to range from to per share 
depreciation and amortization is estimated to be approximately million 
capital spending is anticipated to be in the to million range 
pension expense and related funding are both expected to increase by approximately million and million  respectively  in the company s effective tax rate is estimated to be 
the projections are subject to various factors  including but not limited to  estimated raw material and energy prices  general economic conditions including semiconductor market recovery  see cautionary statement under federal securities laws 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
the company anticipates lower legal expenses in of approximately million  which is based on the current legal proceedings pending or threatened against the company 
if there was a significant change to a current pending or threatened legal proceeding or as new cases develop  it could have a material impact on the company s results 
the company s hydrazine business currently has a three year contract with two one year renewal options with the united states department of the air force to supply hydrazine based propellant  which was effective on march  and has been amended to expire on april  the contract principally consists of a fixed price facility management fee and a product purchase arrangement whereby the company supplies product at a fixed price per pound  adjusted annually for agreed upon cost escalations 
the one year renewal options have not been exercised 
the company is pursuing a new long term hydrazine based propellant supply contract with the defense energy support center desc 
we anticipate the desc will award the contract to a bidder in the first half of  but there is no assurance that such contract will be awarded to the company 
the forecast assumes the renewal of the supply contract or a replacement with a new supply contract 
the failure to obtain this contract could have a material impact on the hydrazine business and the company s results 
in addition to the potential loss of sales and operating income associated with the loss of such contract  the company would also need to assess the potential impairment of its hydrazine business 
in connection with that assessment  the company  among other things  may decide to downsize or possibly shut down its hydrazine facility 
as a result  the company could incur a potential impairment charge and or other shutdown related costs 
the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with the hydrazine propellants is approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements additionally  included in the company s outlook is an estimate of incentive compensation expense for  which is based on the estimated financial performance of the company 
the financial targets are set annually by the company s compensation committee 
the annual incentive plans financial targets are earnings per share and cash flow 
cash flow is defined as ebitda  plus or minus the change in working capital  less capital expenditures 
the company also has a long term incentive plan which has a financial target based on return on equity to be achieved in three years  which can be accelerated to be earned in two years 
if there were a change in the company s estimated financial performance  it could have a significant impact on the amount of compensation expense recorded by the company and may have a material mitigating impact on the company s results 
the company s outlook is also based on assumptions regarding the company s pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are recorded based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected return on plan assets and trends in health care costs  which are updated annually 
market conditions and interest rates significantly impact future assets  liabilities and expense of the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans 
therefore  any changes in such assumptions could impact the company s estimate of expense and  or funding which may be material to the company s future results

environmental the company operates manufacturing facilities throughout the world and as a result is subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in various countries 
the company also implements a variety of voluntary programs to reduce air emissions  eliminate or reduce the generation of hazardous wastes and to decrease the amount of wastewater discharges 
the establishment and implementation of us federal  state and local standards to regulate air and water quality and to govern contamination of land and groundwater has affected  and will continue to affect  substantially all of the company s us manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry in general  and particularly on the chemicals industry 
in addition  the implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  has required  and will continue to require  new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs 
the distribution agreement specifies that the company is only responsible for certain environmental liabilities at the company s current facilities and certain off site locations 
in connection with the acquisition of hickson  the company acquired certain environmental exposures and potential liabilities of current and past operating sites  all of which have been accrued for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the disposition of the sulfuric acid business on july   the company provided environmental covenants to the purchaser in which the company is solely liable for the costs of any environmental claim for remediation of any hazardous substances that were generated  managed  treated  stored or disposed of prior to the closing date of the sale 
the company will be released  under the sales agreement  from its obligation  which cannot exceed million  years from the closing date 
additionally  as part of its environmental indemnifications the company will be responsible  for five years from the closing date  for damages directly related to the process sewer system at the beaumont  texas plant 
as part of the hickson organics disposition  the company will continue to be responsible for known environmental matters 
such matters have previously been accrued for in its environmental reserve included in the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  any unknown environmental matters that are identified subsequent to the sale  the company has agreed to share responsibility with the purchaser over a seven year period  with the company s share decreasing to zero over the seven year period 
the company s maximum aggregate liability for such unknown environmental matters is l million 
the company does not anticipate any exposure related to the environmental indemnifications for the sulfuric acid and the hickson organics dispositions 
the company has estimated that the fair value of any such exposure would be immaterial 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were not material to operating results in  and but may be material in future years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
cash outlays for remedial activities are charged to reserves 
historically  the company has funded its environmental capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and expects to do so in the future 
cash outlays for environmental related activities for  and were as follows years ended december  in millions environmental cash outlays capital projects plant operations remedial activities total environmental cash outlays the company s consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   of which million is classified as current liabilities and million at december   of which million is classified as current liabilities 
the company s estimated environmental liability relates to nine sites  six of which are in the united states and none of which are on the us national priority list 
these amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures  any consideration of insurance recoveries or any advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed or if the costs of remediation efforts can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range from million to million over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
a portion of the higher environmental cash outlays during was associated with a remediation project at the company s conley  georgia wood treatment facility 
total cash outlays since its acquisition capital and remedial were approximately million 
the project was completed in environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies and remedial activities  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against the company

legal matters there are a variety of non environmental legal proceedings pending or threatened against the company 
in connection with the acquisition of hickson  the company assumed certain legal obligations  including a trial court judgment  in favor of a railroad  of approximately million plus interest in a lawsuit associated with a wood preservative spillage in in  a new trial resulted in a judgment of million plus interest 
the railroad has appealed the judgment 
the judgment and related interest is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company does not expect any final resolution of this case to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the company 
the company is a co defendant in consolidated litigation arising from a fire in august  which destroyed a warehouse in which the company s water treatment products were stored 
the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle a portion of the litigation that involves claims by plaintiffs that are individuals 
this agreement requires court approval 
the balance of the litigation primarily involves claims by a number of businesses for property damage 
the company has provided for its exposure in this litigation  including the amount of its participation in the settlement  and does not expect any final resolution on these cases  net of an insurance recovery  to have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial position of the company 
the company settled a product claim by a customer related to a discontinued product in august for million  net of insurance claims of approximately million 
the full settlement of million was paid by the company during the third quarter of actual insurance proceeds of million were received by march  in full settlement of the insurance claims 
the company and or its cca formulating subsidiary arch wood protection  inc were named  along with several other cca manufacturers  several cca customers and various retailers  in five putative class action lawsuits filed in various state and federal courts regarding the marketing and use of cca treated wood 
three of these cases have been dismissed without prejudice 
in the fourth case jacobs v 
osmose  inc et 
al  the federal district court has ruled that the requirements for a class action have not been met and has denied class action status in this case 
subsequently  the court entered an order granting plaintiffs motion for voluntary dismissal of their claims against the company  its subsidiaries and several other defendants 
in the fifth putative class action lawsuit ardoin v 
stine lumber company et 
al  the court has not yet decided the issue of whether the case should or should not be certified as a class action  although management believes the precedent set in the jacobs case will prevail in the ardoin case as well 
the proposed class members in the ardoin case purport to include various persons who purchased cca treated wood products for residential use 
the lawsuit seeks to recover the purchase price and other alleged unquantified damages under various theories  including breach of warranty 
this case does not allege personal injury 
plaintiffs have now moved to dismiss this case with prejudice and the court is still considering plaintiffs motion 
in addition  there are fewer than ten other cca related lawsuits in which the company and or one or more of the company s subsidiaries is involved 
these additional cases are not putative class actions 
they are actions by individual claimants alleging various personal injuries allegedly due to exposure to cca treated wood 
the company and its subsidiaries deny the material allegations of all the various cca related claims and have vigorously defended and will continue to vigorously defend them 
as a result  legal defense and related costs associated with these cases were significant in and  and may increase in the future 
all cca related cases are subject to a number of uncertainties  including in the case of the remaining putative class action  whether and to what extent it will be certified as a class action 
as a result  their impact  if any  is difficult to assess 
based on the information currently available to the company  however  the company does not believe the resolution of these cases is likely to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  cash flow or results of operations 
business and credit concentrations a significant portion of sales of the treatment products segment approximately is dependent upon two customers  one of which accounts for a significant portion of the sales of the hth water products business and the other of which accounts for a significant portion of the sales of the personal care and industrial biocides businesses 
sales to these two customers are individually less than of the company s consolidated sales 
however  the loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the sales and operating results of the respective segment and businesses if such customer was not replaced 
sales of the company s microelectronic materials products segment are dependent upon the economic conditions of the semiconductor industry 
changes in this industry may significantly affect management s estimates of current and future operating results 
additionally  a significant portion of the sales of the microelectronic materials segment is dependent upon one customer approximately 
sales to this customer are less than of the company s consolidated sales 
however  the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on the sales and operating results of the segment if such a customer was not replaced 
sales of the hth water products segment are seasonal in nature as its products are primarily used in the us residential pool market 
historically  approximately of the sales in the hth water products business occur in the second quarter of the fiscal year  as retail sales in the us residential pool market are concentrated between memorial day and the fourth of july 
therefore  interim results for this segment are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year 
in addition  in the hth water products segment changed its distribution strategy from utilizing distributors to directly shipping to retail channels  which has made the hth water product sales even more concentrated in the second and third quarters

certain accounting policies require that estimates and assumptions be made by management for use in the preparation of the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results and that require subjective or complex estimates by management 
these include the following goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and identified intangible assets on a business by business basis reporting unit for impairment 
the company evaluates each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  the company would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company measures the fair value of a reporting unit as the estimated discounted future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the business continues in perpetuity 
the long term terminal growth assumptions reflect the current long term view of the marketplace 
the discount rate is based upon the weighted average cost of capital of each reporting unit 
each year the company re evaluates the assumptions in the discounted cash flow model to address changes in the business and marketplace conditions 
based upon the annual impairment analysis  which is completed in the first quarter  the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value and as a result  the company did not need to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by the company and its competitors and the volatility in the markets in which the company conducts business 
a change in assumptions in the company s cash flows could have a significant impact on the fair value of the company s reporting units  which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company s results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include certain deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are recorded based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  future compensation levels  expected return on plan assets and trends in health care costs  which are updated annually 
the company evaluates these assumptions annually with its actuarial advisors and believe that they are within acceptable industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside the control of the company could have a material impact on the results of operations 
the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure expense for any fiscal year are determined as of january of the current plan year measurement date 
the discount rate assumption used in the pension and postretirement benefit plans accounting is based on current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt as determined on each measurement date 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
valuation of long lived assets the impairment of tangible and intangible assets is assessed when changes in circumstances such as  but not limited to  a decrease in market value of an asset  current and historical operating losses or a change in business strategy indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based on estimates of future cash flows  salvage values or net sales proceeds 
these estimates take into account management s expectations and judgments regarding future business and economic conditions  future market values and disposal costs 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
environmental liabilities liabilities for environmental matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these estimates take into account current law  existing technologies and management s judgment about future changes in regulation 
each quarter the company formally evaluates known and potential sites  and when there are changes in circumstances 
the company reviews estimates for future remediation and maintenance and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
the company s estimate of environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken or current laws and regulations be changed 
for additional information  see the environmental discussion on page restructuring program liabilities during   and  the company recorded charges in connection with its restructuring programs 
management judgment is used to estimate the various costs involved in these programs including severance costs  inventory and fixed asset disposal costs and settlements of contractual obligations 
these liability estimates are reassessed at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from original estimates 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates its current proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel and when there are changes in circumstances 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach

new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities

the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives  which qualify for designation as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the changes in fair value is recognized as part of other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction that is being hedged is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings currently 
changes in fair value for other derivatives  which do not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes are recognized in current period earnings 
based upon the company s current policies of hedging market risks as discussed under item a  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
however  the adoption of sfas may cause increased volatility in the company s results of operations in the future  if the company changes its policies or enters into new derivative instruments  which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under sfas in may  the company terminated its interest rate swap agreements that were entered into in april as a result  the company received cash proceeds of million  which represented the market value of the contracts on the date of termination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes in the normal course of business 
interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk on approximately percent of its outstanding borrowings  including  for this purpose  the participation interests sold under its accounts receivable securitization program  which are subject to floating rates 
based upon the company s expected borrowing levels  an increase in interest rates of basis points would decrease the company s results of operations and cash flows by approximately million 
foreign currency risk approximately percent of the company s sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company is subject to risks associated with its foreign operations  including currency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
these exposures from foreign exchange fluctuations can affect the company s equity investments and its respective share of earnings losses  the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries  translation of the company s foreign operations for us gaap reporting purposes and purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies

the counterparties to the options and contracts are major financial institutions 
at december   the company had no forward contracts to either buy or sell foreign currencies 
holding other variables constant  if there was a percent change in foreign currency exchange rates  the net effect on the company s annual cash flows would be a increase decrease of between million to million related to the unhedged portion  as any increase decrease in cash flows resulting from the company s hedge forward contracts would be offset by an equal decrease increase in cash flows on the underlying transaction being hedged 
the application of sfas may cause increased volatility in the company s results of operations for interim periods in the future if the company changes its policies  or if some of the derivative instruments do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of natural gas utilized at certain manufacturing sites 
depending on market conditions  the company may purchase derivative commodity instruments to minimize the risk of price fluctuations 
at december  and  the company had no forward contracts to purchase natural gas 
in addition  the company is exposed to price risk related to the price volatility of certain other raw materials including the ongoing purchase of propylene and copper metal 
holding other variables constant  a percent adverse change in the price of propylene and copper metal would decrease the company s results of operations and cash flows by approximately million each 
holding other variables constant  a percent adverse change in the price of natural gas would decrease the company s results of operations and cash flows by approximately million
