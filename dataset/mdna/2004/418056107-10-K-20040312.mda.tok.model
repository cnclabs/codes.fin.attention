most of the company s products are either internally developed or licensed from outside inventors 
in addition to the products based on its own core brands  the company also offers internally developed products tied to licensed theatrical and television based entertainment properties  such as star wars and disney movies 
the company s principal business strategies focus on growing its core brands  developing new and innovative toy and game products  and increasing operating margins by optimizing efficiencies within the company 
management views the company s principal product opportunities as falling into three general categories core brands  innovative new products and entertainment based products 
although the company intends to continue to offer products based on licensed entertainment properties  in the past three years the company has actively sought to reduce its reliance on products based on these entertainment properties and to achieve more consistent performance by focusing greater resources on the development and growth of its core brands and on producing innovative products which are not based on movie properties 
the company s core brands represent company owned or company controlled brands  such as gi joe  transformers  my little pony  monopoly  magic the gathering  playskool and tonka  which the company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term 
by focusing on core brands  the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth 
however  the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the long term success of existing product lines and consistently introduce successful new products 
in addition to its focus on core brands  the company s strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities 
in  the success of innovative products such as beyblade  furreal friends  and videonow contributed significantly to the company s success 
although beyblade products accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net revenues in  the company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify opportunistic new products will prevent the company from being dependent on the success of any one product line 
while the company s strategy focuses on growing its core brands and the development of innovative  new products  the company continues to evaluate and enter into strategic arrangements to license entertainment based properties when the company believes it is economically beneficial 
entertainment based licenses in included disney and star wars 
revenues in were positively impacted by increased shipments of star wars products as a result of the release of star wars episode ii attack of the clones  theatrically in may of and on dvd and video in november of although gross profits of entertainment based products are generally higher  this increased gross margin is offset by royalty expenses incurred on these sales  as well as amortization expense of property rights paid to the licensor of such properties 
in recent years  the company has also focused on reducing its fixed costs and increasing its operating margins 
in  the company continued this focus with a number of business efficiency initiatives 
two of these initiatives were the cessation of manufacturing at the company s valencia  spain facility and the announced closure of the remaining retail stores operated under the wizards of the coast and gamekeeper names 
the company continues to review its operations in order to determine areas where greater efficiency can be achieved 
the company s strategy for the near term also focuses on the reduction of long term debt 
the goal of management is to reduce the company s debt to capitalization ratio  defined as total debt  both short term and long term  as a percentage of total equity plus total debt  to over the medium term 
in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a tender offer  pursuant to which the company repurchased  of aggregate principal amount of the notes due previously issued by the company 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the company repurchased or repaid  in principal amount  of notes due in march at december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was approximately  which compared to approximately at december  was a year of continuing consolidation in the toy and game industry  with further store closings and the bankruptcy of two notable toy and game retailers 
as a result  the company s customer base continues to become more concentrated 
while the consolidation of customers may provide certain benefits to the company  such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution  this consolidation also creates additional risks to the company s business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with the company 
in addition  increased customer concentration may decrease the prices the company is able to obtain for some of its products 
the company believes that its strategy of seeking to produce sought after products  which provide value to both consumers and the company s customers  will help protect the company from any negative impact resulting from an environment of increasing retail consolidation

while the company will have continuing revenue and certain costs associated with the sales of products which used to be sold in the retail stores in its future operations  it did not consider operating retail stores core to its business and believes the elimination of these stores will decrease costs to the company and improve business efficiencies 
the operating loss includes a charge of approximately  associated with impairment of long lived assets 
gross profit the company s gross profit margin decreased in to from in  which compares with in the decrease from primarily reflects a change in mix of products sold  with decreased sales of star wars products in over the increase in gross margin from to also reflects this mix of products sold  with increased sales of star wars and disney products partially offset by decreased sales of trading card games 
all of these products have higher gross margins 
in addition to the mix of products sold  the decrease from gross margin levels also reflects charges incurred by the company to cease manufacturing operations in spain  comprised primarily of severance costs as well as non cash charges associated with fixed assets 
the production activities previously performed in spain will be transferred to the company s other manufacturing facilities or outsourced to third party suppliers 
the company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory  attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence 
the company s failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items  which could result in higher obsolescence costs  causing a reduction in gross profit 
expenses amortization expense decreased to  or of net revenues in  compared with amortization of  or of net revenues in and  or of net revenues in the decrease from to is primarily related to decreased amortization of the property rights related to star wars

royalty expense decreased to  or of net revenues in from  or of net revenues in the decrease primarily relates to lower sales of star wars related products 
this decrease was in accordance with the company s expectations as the company continues to focus on its core brands  and there was no theatrical  video  or dvd release of a star wars property in the decrease in royalty expense as a result of star wars was partially offset by increased royalty expense related to beyblade products and the foreign exchange impact of the weaker us dollar 
royalty expense increased to  or of net revenues in from  or of net revenues in the increase was primarily related to increased sales of entertainment based product  principally star wars related 
revenues derived from entertainment based properties  such as star wars  and resultant royalties  while continuous over the life of a contract  are generally higher in amount in the year a theatrical release takes place 
the degree to which revenues  royalties and operating profits fluctuate is dependent not only on theatrical release dates  but video and dvd release dates as well

selling  distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in to  or of net revenues from  or of net revenues in the costs decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in from the costs of  or of net revenues 
the increase in dollars in partially reflects charges relating to the company s announced closure of its remaining retail stores operated under the wizards of the coast and game keeper names 
the increased expenses were also the result of higher distribution expenses due to increased sales volume  higher international expenses in translated us dollars as the result of the weaker us dollar  and increased management bonus provisions as the result of the company s improved financial performance 
these increases offset decreases in certain other expenses resulting from the company s ongoing cost reduction efforts as part of its strategy to make its business more efficient

nonoperating expense in also includes a non cash charge of  related to the increase in the fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability under the provisions of sfas as a result of adopting this new accounting standard  these warrants are now required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings 
the fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by the stock price of the company at the date of measurement  but is also affected by the company s stock price volatility over time as well as risk free interest rates 
assuming the company s stock volatility and risk free interest rates remain constant  the fair value of the warrants will increase and the company will recognize a charge to earnings if the price of the company s stock increases 
if the price of the company s stock decreases and the company s stock volatility and risk free interest rates remain constant  the fair value of the warrants will decrease and the company will recognize income 
based on a hypothetical increase in the company s stock price to per share at december  from its actual price of a share on that date  the company would have recognized an additional non cash charge to earnings of approximately  to adjust the warrants to their fair value 
nonoperating expense for includes a  write down of the value of the common stock of infogrames  held by the company as an available for sale investment 
this charge was partially offset by interest income on a tax settlement of  received in the second quarter of the amount primarily reflects losses on foreign currency transactions  including the impact of the argentine peso devaluation 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in and  in approximately of the decrease in as compared to is attributable to lower levels of short term and long term debt 
this mainly reflects the repurchase and repayment of debt in the first quarter of when the company repurchased or repaid  in principal amount  of notes  due in march  using cash from operations 
in the fourth quarter of  as noted above  the company repurchased  in principal amount of notes due  in conjunction with a tender offer 
the remaining decrease in interest expense in as compared to is due to lower effective interest rates  partially the result of interest rate swap agreements entered into during to reduce the amount of the company s debt subject to fixed interest rates 
the company expects interest expense to continue to decrease in as a result of the company executing its strategy of reducing its debt to capitalization ratio through reductions in long term debt 
a decrease in average borrowing rates accounted for approximately of the decrease in interest expense from to this decrease was primarily the result of the issuance of  of convertible senior debentures in november and december of  the proceeds of which were used to repurchase debt with higher interest rates 
to a lesser extent  average borrowing rates decreased as the result of interest rate swap agreements entered into in may the remaining of the decrease in interest expense in was due to decreased average borrowings in  primarily reflecting decreased short term borrowings in as well as the repurchase  in principal amount  of  of notes due march during the last three quarters of income taxes income tax expense was of pretax earnings in compared with of pretax earnings in and in absent the effect of the charge related to the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value  which has no tax effect  the effective tax rate would have been

sfas required the company to reclassify certain warrants recorded as equity to a liability  and adjust the warrants to their fair value through earnings as of that date 
on the date of adoption  the company reclassified  from equity  where the warrants had previously been recorded  to current liabilities 
a cumulative effect of accounting change of  was recorded to adjust the amount of this liability to its fair value on the adoption date 
there is no tax benefit associated with this charge 
on december   the first day of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas required the company  within six months of the date of adoption  to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
this initial assessment was completed during the second quarter of as part of this assessment  the company allocated goodwill and other corporate assets and liabilities to its various reporting units 
it then compared the carrying values of its reporting units to the fair values of those reporting units 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
these values were compared in total with the fair value of the business based on market capitalization at the date of testing 
based on the result of this assessment  the company recorded a one time transitional charge of  net of related tax impact of  resulting from the impairment of goodwill relating to the us toys reporting unit primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method 
this transitional charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change and  in accordance with the statement  recorded retroactively to the first quarter of during  the company adopted the provisions of sfas which required that the company record all derivatives  such as foreign exchange contracts  on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated  effective and qualify as cash flow hedges  are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of adopting sfas  and in accordance with the transition provisions  the company recorded a one time after tax charge of  during representing the cumulative effect of the adoption in its consolidated statements of operations and an after tax unrealized loss of to aoce  which the company reclassified to earnings in liquidity and capital resources hasbro has historically generated a significant amount of cash from normal operations 
the company has funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations  as well as utilizing  when needed  borrowings under its secured and unsecured credit facilities

as receivables are collected  the proceeds are used to repay outstanding short term debt 
during  the company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through operations and  when needed  through its revolving credit facility or receivable securitization program 
as an additional source of working capital and liquidity  in december  the company entered into a three year receivable securitization program whereby undivided interests in up to  of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable are sold  on a revolving basis  to bank conduits 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  receivable interests securitized are accounted for as a sale and removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes that the funds available to it  including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through the securitization program and committed lines of credit  are adequate to meet its needs for however  unforeseen circumstances in the toy or game industry  such as softness in the retail environment or unanticipated changes in consumer preferences could result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results for the company  which could result in the company being in non compliance with its debt covenants and unable to use funding from its receivable securitization program 
non compliance with its debt covenants could result in the company being unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility  other bank lines and the securitization program  a circumstance most likely to occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable the company to continue to fund its operations 
in addition  a significant deterioration in the business of a major us customer could result in a decrease in eligible accounts receivable which would prevent the company from being able to fully utilize its receivable securitization program 
the company expects to be in compliance with its borrowing and securitization covenants in long term debt increased from nil in to  at december  this increase was the result of funding the company s and business acquisitions  as well as repurchases of the company s common stock 
during the last three fiscal years  as part of its strategy of reducing long term debt and its overall debt to capitalization ratio  the company has been able to repurchase or repay approximately  in principal amount of long term debt  primarily using cash from operations 
remaining principal amounts of long term debt at december  were  the company believes that the continuing reduction in its debt to capitalization ratio improves its liquidity situation by both decreasing cash required to service outstanding debt and by increasing the ability of the company to obtain additional financing if the need to do so arises 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  net of short term borrowings  were  which compares to  and  at december  and december   respectively 
hasbro generated approximately   and  of net cash from its operating activities in  and  respectively 
although net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change increased to  in compared to  in  the decrease in cash from operations in to was primarily the result of non cash expenditures in  including utilization of prepaid expenses related to star wars royalties  and increased amortization expense in  primarily star wars related 
net cash provided by operating activities in also included a  royalty advance payment  which was recorded as a long term asset 
the increased cash flows from operations in from results primarily from the company s aggressive management of its cash flow requirements 
cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by the company s cost reduction initiatives in   and  resulting in a lower level of fixed operating expenses 
fourth quarter days sales outstanding improved to days from days in and days in accounts receivable at year end is primarily composed of fourth quarter revenues

at december   there was  outstanding under this program 
the securitization facility replaced other programs routinely used by the company to accelerate payment of trade receivables in prior years

inventories decreased to  at december  from  at december  as a result of the company s inventory management and  to a lesser extent  the disposition of substantially all of its remaining retail stores operated under the wizards of the coast and gamekeeper names

improved inventory management in resulted in inventory levels being approximately  or lower at december than december prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase was primarily related to prepaid amounts relating to an increase in deferred and other taxes and other prepaid expenses and deposits 
prepaid expenses and other current assets also increased  to a lesser extent  as a result of the currency impact of the weaker us dollar 
these increases partially offset decreases in prepaid royalties from generally  when the company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment based properties  an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement 
this payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made 
in addition to the decrease related to star wars products  the decrease in advanced royalties is also due to the company s business strategy of focusing on its core brands and reducing its reliance on licensed products 
increased sales of entertainment based licensed products  primarily star wars products  in resulted in a decrease in prepaid royalties from  net of a  royalty advance paid in relating to the star wars license 
due to the timing of future expected royalties covered by this payment  this advance was recorded in other assets as a long term advance

due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period  payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year 
this timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected made it necessary for the company to borrow varying amounts during the year 
during   and  the company primarily utilized cash from operations and borrowing under its secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement to meet its cash flow requirements

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  inventory valuation  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions 
sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer  at the time of shipment 
revenue from product sales  less related sales allowances  is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers 
these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs  which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year 
discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale 
while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts  certain of the allowances  such as the returns allowance  are based on market data  historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
based upon a consideration of quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volume  anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued  slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value 
failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the company underproducing popular items or overproducing less popular items 
management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded  as an increase to cost of sales  when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  the company will perform an interim test at that time 
the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units 
goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach 
the company s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was indicated 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  during  there were no significant impairment charges related to these intangible assets 
the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties 
at december   the company had  of prepaid royalties   of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  which are included in other assets 
the company  except for certain international subsidiaries  has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees 
pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets  expected compensation increases  and applicable discount rates 
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan  the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes  and the current economic environment 
based on this information  the company s estimate of expected return on plan assets in and was and in was 
a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense  while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately  expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the company s long term business forecasts 
based on this analysis  the company s estimate of expected long term compensation increases was in and and in increases in estimated compensation increases would increase pension expense while decreases would decrease pension expense 
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the company considers moody s long term aa corporate bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate 
at september   the company s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities  the moody s long term corporate bond yield was  and the company selected a discount rate of 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the company s discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately  and  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 
in and  the company recorded a minimum pension liability of  and  respectively 
this amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of its business  the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license  which may require the payment of minimum guarantees  as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment 
in addition  the company has  of long term debt outstanding at december   including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments 
future payments required under these and other obligations are as follows payments due by fiscal year certain contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt  including current installments    operating lease commitments      future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments   purchase commitments   included in the thereafter column above is  in principal amount of senior convertible debt due the holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the company in december  december  and december at the principal amount 
at that time  the purchase price may be paid in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of the two 
the company s current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised

in addition to the above  the company has certain warrants outstanding at december  that contain a put option that would require the company to repurchase the warrants for a price to be paid  at the company s election  of either  in cash or  in shares of the company s common stock  such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option 
the company s current intent is to settle this put option in cash if exercised 
in accordance with sfas  these warrants are recorded as an accrued liability at fair value at december  in addition  the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately  to its pension plans in the company also has letters of credit of approximately  at december  financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  for the most part as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars  hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty five currencies 
results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar  hong kong dollar  euro  british pound  canadian dollar  mexican peso and  to a lesser extent  other currencies  including those in latin american and asia pacific countries 
to manage this exposure  the company has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased foreign currency options 
the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate unfavorable movement in the us dollar could result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition 
in addition  the company s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
from time to time  affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency 
the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not speculate in  and  other than as set forth above  the company does not hedge foreign currency exposures 
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt  including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments  of  at december   the company had fixed for floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of  the interest rate swaps are designed to adjust the amount of the company s debt subject to a fixed interest rate 
the interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt 
changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of long term debt 
at december   these contracts had a fair value of  which is recorded in other assets  with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase long term debt 
changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps 
the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately  or  respectively 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease pretax earnings and cash flows by  and  respectively 
the economy and inflation the company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during the principal market for the company s products is the retail sector 
revenues from the company s top customers  all retailers  accounted for approximately of its consolidated net revenues in and in the past year certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty 
the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 
the company s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year  and within that half  the fourth quarter  to be more significant to its overall business for the full year 
the company expects this trend will continue 
the concentration of sales in the second half of the year and  specifically  the fourth quarter increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items  b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules 
the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line  product availability  marketing strategies  inventory levels  policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions 
the trend of retailers over the past few years has been to purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 
quick response inventory management practices now being used by many retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment 
to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated  their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed  thus negatively impacting the company s revenues 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company s significant retailers could negatively impact the company s future revenues 
the effect of inflation on the company s operations during was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices  accordingly 
other information hasbro uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees 
as required by the company s existing stock plans  stock options are granted at  or above  the fair market value of the company s stock  and  accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company records compensation expense related to other stock based awards  such as restricted stock grants  over the period the award vests  typically three years 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb announced that it would mandate the fair value method of accounting for all stock based awards 
the fasb is still drafting a preliminary statement  which is due out in the first quarter of and would be subject to a comment period 
if enacted  the change in accounting is not expected to be effective for the company until fiscal until a formal statement is issued  the company cannot estimate the effect that this change in accounting would have on its consolidated statements of operations 
the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position
