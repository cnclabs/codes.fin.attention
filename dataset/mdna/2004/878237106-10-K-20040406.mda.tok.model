item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a asset management 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and product categories may vary from region to region  over the past three years  sales within our consolidated product categories have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges peripherals systems networking software 
table of contents hp acquired compaq computer corporation compaq in may worldwide net sales of products purchased from hp or hp compaq combined accounted for   and of consolidated net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
hp has increased the level of business it transacts directly with end users and or resellers 
our net sales have been adversely affected by this trend  which has been primarily focused on hp s computer systems business in the united states 
hp s printer business and european computer systems business have not yet been significantly affected 
hp also continues to modify certain contract terms and conditions  some of which may push additional costs into the channel 
in response to these changes  we continue to evaluate and modify our pricing policies and terms and conditions with our customers  as well as pursue other vendor and product categories 
it should also be noted that the adverse effect on our us business of hp s direct strategy has not been as dramatic in recent quarters 
in each of the last four quarters  our sales of hp computer systems in the americas represents less than three percent of our quarterly worldwide sales 
while our future exposure in our hp systems business may not be significant  no assurance can be given that we will not be adversely affected should hp proceed with a more aggressive direct strategy within europe or with its printer business 
in addition  microsoft software accounted for of our net sales in fiscal there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our net sales in   or customers and services we purchase products directly from manufacturers and publishers in large quantities for sale to an active reseller base of approximately  vars  direct marketers  retailers  internet resellers and corporate resellers 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and customer channels may vary from region to region  over the past three years sales within our consolidated customer channels have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges vars direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers corporate resellers no single customer accounted for more than five percent of our net sales during fiscal   or the market for vars is attractive because vars generally rely on distributors as their principal source of computer products and financing 
this reliance is due to vars typically lacking the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships or stock significant product inventories 
direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with manufacturers and publishers for their more popular products  but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and the alternative source for products acquired directly 
we have also developed special programs to meet the unique needs of direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers 
in addition to a strong product offering  we provide resellers a high level of service through our pre and post sale technical support  suite of electronic commerce tools including web order entry and edi services  customized shipping documents  product configuration integration services and flexible financing programs 
we also provide services to our vendors by giving them the opportunity to participate in a number of special promotions  training programs and marketing services targeted to the needs of our resellers 
while we believe that services such as these help to set us apart from our competition  they contribute less than to our overall revenues 
we provide our vendors one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the americas and europe  delivering products to customers from our regionally located logistics centers 
locating logistics centers near our customers enables us to deliver products on a timely basis  thereby reducing the customers need to invest in inventory 
see item properties for further discussion of our locations and logistics centers 
sales and electronic commerce currently  our sales force consists of approximately  field and inside telemarketing sales representatives 
field sales representatives are located in major metropolitan areas 
each field representative is supported by inside telemarketing sales teams covering a designated territory 
our team concept provides a strong personal relationship between representatives of the customers and tech data 
territories with no field representation are serviced exclusively by the inside telemarketing sales teams 
customers typically call their inside sales teams on dedicated toll free numbers or contact us through various electronic methods to place orders 
if the product is in stock and the customer has available credit  customer orders are generally shipped the same day from the logistics facility nearest the customer 
increasingly  customers rely upon our electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to our product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
our on line computer systems allows the inside sales teams to check current stocking levels in the company s logistics centers 
through our website  most customers can gain remote 
table of contents access to our information systems to check product availability and pricing and to place orders 
certain of our larger customers have edi services available whereby orders  order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports  customized pricing information and other industry standard edi transactions are consummated on line  which improves efficiency and timeliness for ourselves and our customers 
during fiscal  approximately billion of our worldwide sales dollar volume originated from orders received electronically  compared to approximately billion in fiscal we also provide comprehensive training to our field and inside sales representatives regarding technical characteristics of products and our policies and procedures 
in addition  this training program is supplemented by product seminars offered by manufacturers and publishers 
competition we operate in a market characterized by intense competition  based upon such factors as product availability  credit availability  price  delivery and various services and support provided by the distributor to the customer 
we believe that we are well equipped to compete effectively with other distributors in all of these areas 
we compete against several distributors in the americas market  including ingram micro  synnex  and several regional and local distributors 
competition outside of the americas includes ingram micro  actebis and a variety of smaller regional and local distributors 
we also compete with manufacturers and publishers who sell directly to resellers and end users 
nevertheless  we believe that in the majority of cases  manufacturers and publishers choose to sell products through distributors rather than directly because of the relatively small volume and high selling costs associated with numerous small orders 
management also believes that our prompt delivery of products and efficient handling of returns provide an important competitive advantage over manufacturers and publishers efforts to market their products directly 
employees on january   we had approximately  employees located as follows americas  and europe  certain of our employees in various countries outside the americas are subject to laws providing representation rights to employees on management boards 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we operate predominately in a single industry segment as a distributor of it products  logistics management  and other value added services 
while we operate primarily in one industry  because of our global presence  we are managed by our geographic segments 
starting in the first quarter of fiscal  we modified our management structure and combined our us  canadian and latin american operations into the americas region 
our canadian and latin american operations were previously reported separately as the other international region 
as a result  our geographic segments include the americas united states  canada  latin america and export sales to latin america and the caribbean from the us and europe europe  middle east  and export sales to africa 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
in fiscal   and    and  respectively  of our sales were derived from outside of the americas 
over the last three fiscal years  we have entered new markets or expanded our presence in existing markets and exited certain markets based upon our assessment of  among other factors  risk and earnings potential 
such actions included our acquisition of azlan during the first quarter of fiscal  for approximately million plus acquisition related expenses of million  for a total purchase price of million 
the sale of our baltics operations estonia  latvia and lithuania at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal for their approximate book value of million 
the closure of our operations in norway and hungary during the first half of fiscal operating losses incurred during the wind down of these operations totaled less than million  which has been reflected in operating income during fiscal the sale of our operations in argentina to local management and the liquidation of one of our european financing subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal with respect to the argentina transaction  we recorded a charge of approximately million on the sale  in addition to the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange losses previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the liquidation of the european financing subsidiary  we repatriated approximately million of 
table of contents capital  which resulted in the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange gains previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net effect of these transactions resulted in a total pre tax loss of approximately million  recorded within loss on disposition of subsidiaries during fiscal we continue to evaluate our risk exposure eg  risks surrounding currency rates  regulatory environments  political instability  etc 
and earnings potential around the world 
to the extent we decide to close additional operations  we may incur charges and operating losses related to such closures  as well as recognize a portion of our accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a non operating foreign currency exchange gain or loss

results of operations starting in the first quarter of fiscal  we modified our management structure and combined our us  canadian and latin american operations into the americas region 
our canadian and latin american operations were previously reported separately as the other international region 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
overview during fiscal  we saw our worldwide net sales grow to billion  a increase over fiscal this growth can be attributed to the performance of our european operations  where net sales grew over fiscal as a result of our acquisition of azlan group plc azlan  one of the leading distributors of networking and communications equipment in europe  the strengthening of the euro  and stronger market demand during the second half of fiscal compared to european net sales represented of our worldwide net sales during fiscal net sales in the americas declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the continued economic slowdown and the highly competitive market conditions within the united 
table of contents states 
however  similar to europe  the americas saw stronger demand and reported positive  albeit slight  year over year growth during the second half of the year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal this increase was largely due to the acquisition of azlan  which reports higher gross margins on a relative basis than the rest of our worldwide operations  and the impact of implementing emerging issues task force number  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf issue no 

eitf issue no 
resulted in a reclassification of funds received from vendors amounting to million from selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  with million recorded as a reduction of cost of good sold  thereby increasing gross margin  and the remaining million being deferred until the related inventory is sold 
the background and impact of eitf issue no 
is discussed in greater detail later in this document 
absent the impact of azlan and eitf issue no 
 our gross margin in fiscal would have declined compared to fiscal this decline was most pronounced in the americas due to the highly competitive pricing environment and our desire to maintain  and in some cases  increase our market share 
sg a as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the higher cost structure of azlan and the impact of eitf issue no 
excluding these impacts  our sg a as a percentage of net sales would have been roughly flat on a year over year basis  as we responded to the decrease in net sales on a local currency basis with improvements to the productivity and efficiency of our operations 
operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin was 
of net sales  or basis points  during fiscal  compared to a negative basis points during fiscal fiscal and included special charges which reduced operating income by two basis points and basis points  respectively 
excluding the impact of these special charges  operating margin declined by basis points during fiscal compared to this decline is largely the result of the pricing pressure we saw in the americas  where operating margins decreased to of net sales in fiscal  compared to in in europe  operating margins were adversely affected by competitive pricing in the region  although not as intense as that seen in the americas  and incremental costs incurred during fiscal for employee severance costs and the harmonization and upgrade of our european systems infrastructure

net sales the following table represents our net sales by geographic segment year ended january  change change net sales americas europe total our net sales within the americas declined on a year over year basis during fiscal and the vast majority of these declines took place within the united states  where our performance was adversely affected by the general economic slowdown  the effect of highly competitive market conditions within the distribution industry and the direct sales efforts of certain vendors  primarily hp 

table of contents our net sales within europe increased on a year over year basis during fiscal and during fiscal  this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of azlan  which was acquired in march  and the stronger euro versus the us dollar 
our legacy european operations ie  excluding azlan experienced a slight year over year decrease in net sales on a local currency basis during fiscal our year over year decline in net sales during fiscal in our legacy european operations on a local currency basis is primarily due to the impact of lower demand for technology products and services during the first half of this year and our exit last year from certain markets in europe  more than offsetting the positive growth we saw during the second half of fiscal  as further discussed below 
our year over year decline in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributed to the general slowdown of the it industry during the period 
during the second semester of fiscal  we began to see an improvement in sales performance on a local currency basis within both regions  and  in fact  experienced positive sales growth on a year over year basis  with the americas growing approximately during the second semester while our legacy european operations experienced sales growth in the mid single digits on a percentage basis in local currency 
this positive growth can be attributed to an improvement in general market demand during the second half of fiscal in both regions and our desire to maintain and  in some cases  increase our market share position with certain customers and or vendors  while still achieving acceptable profit margins 
gross profit our consolidated gross margin increased basis points in fiscal compared to the prior year  after declining by basis points during fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase in gross margin during fiscal is largely the result of the inclusion of the operating results of azlan which realize higher gross margins than our legacy operations and the impact of our adoption of eitf issue no 
as discussed below  offset by declining product gross margins in our legacy operations 
our legacy operations experienced a year over year decline in gross margins due to the highly competitive pricing environment during the period  especially in the americas  and our desire to maintain or  in some cases  increase our market share position  as previously discussed above 
in addition  as we analyzed business opportunities  our low cost structure allowed us to realize  in many cases  acceptable operating profits in spite of lower gross margins 
the basis point decrease in gross margin during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to our european operations  which saw generally greater competitive margin pressures in an attempt to maintain market share 
gross margin within both operating segments for fiscal year includes a reclassification pursuant to eitf issue no 
eitf issue no 
requires that  under certain circumstances  consideration received from vendors be treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold and not as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
eitf issue no 
further requires the recognition of such consideration be deferred until the related inventory is sold 
the new guidance was applicable to vendor arrangements entered into or modified subsequent to december  as a result of implementing eitf issue no 
 for fiscal year  we reclassified approximately million 
of net sales from selling  general and administrative expenses with million 
of net sales recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and the remaining million 
of net sales recorded as deferred revenue offsetting inventory on the balance sheet pending sale of the related inventory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which represents the first quarter where eitf issue no 
was applicable to all our vendor arrangements  we reclassified approximately million 
of net sales from selling  general and administrative expenses with million 
of net sales recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and the remaining million 
of net sales recorded as deferred revenue 
going forward  we do not expect there to be material deviations in the deferred revenue balance  however  the actual deferred revenue amounts recorded will be based on the nature and amount of vendor funding received and related quarter end inventory levels 
similarly  to the extent there are no material changes to our future vendor agreements  of which no assurance can be made  we would expect the relative impact on gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses in future quarters to be in the range of that experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal  sg a increased by  or million from the prior year 
similar to the increase in net sales and gross profit  the increase in sg a for fiscal year can be attributed primarily to the inclusion of the results from azlan  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  and our adoption of eitf issue no 
also impacting our sg a this year are the project and operating costs we have incurred for the harmonization and upgrade of our european systems infrastructure 
such costs expensed during fiscal approximated million compared to million in the prior year 
excluding the above factors  sg a incurred by our legacy operations actually declined year over year on a local currency basis 
this sg a performance would have been more favorable had we not incurred charges this year associated with workforce reductions in excess of the amount incurred in the prior year 
during fiscal  sg a decreased by or million from the prior year 
on a relative basis  sg a decreased five basis points to of net sales compared to in fiscal included in the million in cost reductions are million related to the elimination of goodwill amortization  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  this reduction was offset almost entirely by the approximate million that we expensed on harmonizing and upgrading our european systems infrastructure during fiscal we achieved the sg a performance described above through our constant monitoring of costs  including tight budgetary controls and productivity reviews 
these productivity reviews result in a highly variable cost model with an ability to better respond to changes in market demand compared to those companies with high fixed costs 
as an example  during the economic downturn  we have managed our total headcount within our legacy operations down by over from the fourth quarter of fiscal  most of which came from general attrition 
likewise  we dramatically cut back on and continue to closely monitor discretionary expenses such as travel related costs  consulting and supplies 
special charges during fiscal  we incurred special charges of million  or 
of net sales  related to the closure of our education business in the united states and the restructuring of this business to a more variable cost based  outsourced model 
these charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance  facility lease terminations and the write offs of fixed assets associated with the business 
during fiscal  operating income was negatively affected by a million impairment to goodwill resulting from the application of sfas no 
sfas no 
revised the standards of accounting for goodwill by replacing the amortization of these assets with the requirement that they be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual test of goodwill to determine if there was impairment 
this testing included the determination of each reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast  primarily due to the prolonged downturn in the economy  uncertain demand  and competitive industry conditions  resulted in the determination that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
the million non cash charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in performing the annual test for goodwill impairment for fiscal and fiscal  we determined there was no impairment 
during fiscal  we incurred special charges of million 
these special charges related to the recording of a the write off of previously capitalized software costs million  b the impairment of certain internet related investments million and  c the write off of development costs associated with a new german logistics center million  the construction of which has been indefinitely deferred 
the remaining internet related investment had a carrying value of approximately million at january  and investments in these types of technologies are inherently risky and we could lose the remainder of our investment 
loss on disposition of subsidiaries during fiscal  as a result of currency related issues  political instability and continued economic concerns in the country  we decided to sell our operations in argentina to local management 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we liquidated one of our european financing subsidiaries 
with respect to the argentina transaction  we recorded a charge of approximately million on the sale  in addition to the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange losses previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the liquidation of the european financing subsidiary  we repatriated approximately million of capital  which resulted in the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange gains previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net effect of these transactions resulted in a total pre tax loss of approximately million  recorded within loss on disposition of subsidiaries during fiscal 
table of contents there were no significant gains or losses resulting from dispositions of subsidiaries during fiscal and interest expense  interest income  foreign currency exchange gains losses interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as more fully described below  we redeemed our million  convertible subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of fiscal the debt instruments we utilized during fiscal were at lower interest rates as compared to the redeemed debentures  and accordingly  resulted in significantly lower interest expense 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this reduction was primarily due to the use of excess cash to reduce debt and to fund a portion of the azlan acquisition in march interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was the result of a significant reduction in our average outstanding indebtedness and a decline in our interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal was slightly offset as a result of a million premium payment related to the redemption of our million  convertible subordinated debentures on december  the debentures  scheduled to mature on july   were redeemed at a price of or million 
this redemption allowed us to take advantage of the current lower interest rate environment 
interest income remained relatively flat at million  increasing less than over fiscal we realized net foreign currency exchange gains of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended january    and  respectively 
we recognize net foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily due to the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  versus other currencies 
it continues to be our goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through an effective hedging program 
additionally  our hedging policy prohibits speculative foreign currency exchange transactions 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the change in effective tax rate is primarily due to non deductible special charges recognized during fiscal due to a decrease in our taxable income before special charges  the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal with the change again being primarily due to non deductible charges recognized in fiscal the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this tax increase was primarily due to an increase in fiscal taxable income as compared to fiscal the effective tax rates are also impacted by favorable tax audit results  cumulative and current period net operating losses in certain geographic regions  and management s determination of the related deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at january   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable income tax exposures 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
net income and earnings per share as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million in fiscal  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share in fiscal excluding special charges and the loss on disposition of subsidiaries  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share in fiscal compared to per diluted share in fiscal as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased to a net loss of million in fiscal  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal as discussed above  special charges and the loss on disposition of subsidiaries incurred during fiscal had the impact of reducing our diluted earnings per share by per share 
special charges incurred during fiscal had the impact of reducing our diluted earnings per share by 
per share 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  personnel funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
we have historically recorded unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors as a reduction of inventory and recognized the incentives as a reduction of cost of products sold when the related inventory was sold 
with the implementation of eitf issue no 
 such treatment is also applicable for all other incentives we receive from vendors  such as cooperative advertising allowances and personnel funding 
the impact of the implementation of eitf issue no 
is discussed within the results of operations section of this document 
goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment 
goodwill may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs and purchased intangibles  as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
deferred taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  we consider a variety of factors including  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
however  the recognition of any future tax benefit resulting from the reduction of the million valuation allowance associated with the purchase of azlan would be recorded as a reduction in goodwill 
should we determine that we are unable to use all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include tax  legal and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the microcomputer industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline 
management believes that most price increases could be passed on to our customers  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
specific historical seasonal variations have included a reduction of demand in europe during the summer months and an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter 
the product cycle of major products and any company acquisition or disposition may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non cash charges and the positive effect of our focus on working capital management 
one outcome of our working capital management was the reduction of our owned inventory levels the percentage of inventory not financed by vendors to a negative at the end of fiscal  meaning our accounts payable balances exceeded our inventory balances by 
this compares to a negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal we also monitor our cash conversion cycle or net cash days  defined as days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo as a key indicator of our working capital management 
at the end of fiscal  our net cash days were days compared to days at the end of fiscal dso is calculated as quarter end accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales during the quarter 
dos is calculated as quarter end inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold during the quarter 
dpo is calculated as quarter end accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold during the quarter 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily attributable to the acquisition of azlan and the continued investment related to the expansion of our management information systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  which included million in capitalized costs related to harmonizing and upgrading our european systems infrastructure 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal to further expand or upgrade our it systems  logistics centers and office facilities  which include approximately million to continue upgrading our european systems infrastructure 
we continue to make significant investments to implement new it systems and upgrade our existing it infrastructure in order to meet our changing business requirements 
these implementations and upgrades occur at various levels throughout our organization and include  but are not limited to  new operating and enterprise systems  financial systems  web technologies  customer relationship management systems and telecommunications 
while we believe we will realize increased operating efficiencies as a result of these investments  unforeseen circumstances or complexities could have an adverse impact on our business 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal reflects the use of cash to pay down our revolving credit facilities partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan 
as of january   we maintained a million multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires in may we pay interest average rate of at january  under this facility at the applicable eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
additionally  we maintained a million receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks that expires in august  which we intend to renew 
we pay interest average rate of at january  on the receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin 
in addition to these credit facilities  we maintained lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million average interest rate on borrowings was at january  
the aforementioned credit facilities total approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  these credit facilities contain covenants that must be complied with on a continuous basis  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the amount of common stock that may be repurchased annually 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of january  the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which limits our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
for example  our total borrowings on certain credit facilities are limited to a multiple of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda recognized during the last twelve months 
the ebitda calculation within our covenants allows for certain special charges  such as goodwill impairments  to be excluded 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately million 
in addition  at january   we had issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain 
table of contents third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under our credit agreements by the same amount 
for a more detailed discussion of our credit facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year and are convertible into our common stock at any time  if the market price of the common stock exceeds a specified percentage of the conversion price per share of common stock  beginning at and declining each year until it reaches at maturity  or in other specified instances 
holders may convert debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on any of the fourth  eighth  twelfth or sixteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
although it is our intention to use cash to satisfy any debentures submitted for repurchase  we have the option to satisfy such repurchases in either cash and or our common stock  provided that shares of common stock at the first purchase date will be valued at of fair market value as defined in the indenture and at of fair market value for all subsequent purchase dates 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash  at our option at any time on or after december  we will pay contingent interest on the debentures during specified six month periods beginning on december   if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the dilutive impact of the million of convertible subordinated debentures  due  is excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations due to the conditions for the contingent conversion feature not being met 
in december  the company redeemed million  convertible subordinated debentures at a price of  or million  plus interest accrued to the redemption date 
the redemption was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the company s revolving credit loans 
unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the debentures were not significant 
in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for million of debt and equity securities 
the net proceeds from any issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  the repayment or refinancing of debt and to meet working capital needs 
as of january   we had not issued any debt or equity securities under this registration statement  nor can any assurances be given that we will issue any debt or equity securities under this registration statement in the future 
our balance sheet at january  was one of the strongest in our history as evidenced by a senior debt to capital ratio of five percent and a total debt to capital ratio of 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations principal maturities of long term debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments are as follows operating leases capital leases long term debt total in thousands fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility on july   we completed a restructuring of our synthetic lease facility with a group of financial institutions the restructured lease under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
the restructured lease expires in  at which time we have the following options renew the lease for an additional five years  purchase the properties at an amount equal to their cost  or remarket the properties 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each of the properties  in an aggregate amount of approximately million 
at any time during the lease term  we may  at our option  purchase up to four of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each property s cost 
the restructured lease contains covenants that must be complied with on a continuous basis  similar to the covenants described in certain of the aforementioned credit facilities 
the amount funded under the restructured lease is treated as debt under the definition of the covenants required under both the restructured lease and the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the restructured lease is fully funded at january   in the approximate amount of million 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the restructured lease at january  was approximately million 
properties leased under the restructured lease facility total million square feet of space  with land totaling acres located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  atlanta  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the restructured lease has been accounted for as an operating lease 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
requires us to evaluate whether an entity with which we are involved meets the criteria of a vie and  if so  whether we are required to consolidate that entity 
we have determined that the third party lessor of our synthetic lease facility does not meet the criteria of a vie and  therefore  is not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
guarantees to encourage certain customers to purchase product from the company  the company provides financial guarantees to third party lenders on behalf of those customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where the company would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the third party lender 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
additionally  the company believes that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote 
the company also provides residual value guarantees related to the restructured lease 
the company sold trade receivables to a financial institution  amounting to approximately million in january the transaction was accounted for as a sale and accordingly  has been excluded from the consolidated balance sheet 
given these receivables were sold with recourse  the company has considered the risk of loss associated with these receivables within its assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at january asset management we manage our inventories by maintaining sufficient quantities to achieve high order fill rates while attempting to stock only those products in high demand with a rapid turnover rate 
inventory balances fluctuate as we add new product lines and when appropriate  we make large purchases  including cash purchases from manufacturers and publishers when the terms of such purchases are considered advantageous 
our contracts with most of our vendors provide price protection and stock rotation privileges to reduce the risk of loss due to manufacturer price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory 
in the event of a vendor price reduction  we generally receive a credit for the impact on products in inventory  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we have the right to rotate a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock rotation privileges as well as our inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of loss of inventory value 
we attempt to control losses on credit sales by closely monitoring customers creditworthiness through our it systems  which contain detailed information on each customer s payment history and other relevant information 
we have obtained credit insurance that insures a percentage of the credit extended by us to certain customers against possible loss 
customers who qualify for credit terms are typically granted net day payment terms in the americas 
while credit terms in the european union eu vary by country  the vast majority of customers in the eu are granted credit terms ranging from days 
we also sell products on a prepay  credit card  cash on delivery and floor plan basis 

table of contents deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recorded for net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences 
our deferred tax assets relate to subsidiary operations located in different countries with separate taxing jurisdictions 
although aggregate foreign operations generate pre tax income  certain subsidiaries have a history of net operating losses 
the net change in the deferred income tax valuation allowance was an increase of million at january  with approximately million of this increase being associated with the acquisition of azlan 
to the extent the azlan acquisition related deferred tax assets are realized in future periods  such benefit would be recorded as a reduction in goodwill 
the deferred tax valuation allowance at january  primarily relates to foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the majority of the net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period with the remaining portion expiring in years through we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
acquisitions effective march   we completed the acquisition of azlan  a european distributor of networking and communications products and provider of training and other value added services 
shareholders of azlan received pence per ordinary share  resulting in total cash consideration of approximately million pounds sterling million  which we funded from our existing credit facilities 
we subsequently incurred acquisition related expenses of approximately million for a total purchase price of million 
the azlan acquisition strengthened our position in europe with respect to networking products and value added services and was accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the net assets and results of operations of azlan have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large international organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
with our acquisition of azlan and the sales performance this past year in europe  the percentage of our business with exposure to currency risk is increasing 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed and not to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our primary exposure relates to transactions in europe  canada  and latin america  where the currency collected from customers is different from the currency used to purchase the product 
in addition  we have foreign currency risk related to debt that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes 
foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge intercompany loans  trade receivables and payables 
we have elected not to designate our foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and they are therefore marked to market with changes in their value recorded in the income statement each period 
the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  danish krone  euros  swedish krona and swiss franc 
the following table provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of january  and the information is provided in united states dollar equivalents

table of contents we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and to finance working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion 
interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and third party loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of the outstanding debt had fixed interest rates through the terms of such debt or through interest rate swap agreements
