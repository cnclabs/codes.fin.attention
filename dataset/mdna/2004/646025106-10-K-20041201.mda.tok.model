item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview new jersey resources njr or the company is an energy services holding company providing retail natural gas service in the state of new jersey and wholesale natural gas and related energy services to customers in states from the gulf coast to new england  and canada 
its principal subsidiary  new jersey natural gas njng  is a natural gas utility  which provides regulated retail natural gas service in central and northern new jersey and also participates in the off system sales and capacity release markets 
njng is regulated by the new jersey board of public utilities bpu 
njr s most significant unregulated subsidiary  njr energy services njres  provides unregulated wholesale energy services 
the retail and other segment includes njr home services njrhs  which provides service  sales and installation of appliances  njr energy  an investor in energy related ventures  commercial realty and resources cr r  a commercial real estate developer  and njr investment  which makes energy related equity investments 
net income and assets by business segment are as follows thousands net income natural gas distribution energy services retail and other total thousands assets natural gas distribution energy services retail and other total natural gas distribution operations have been managed with the goal of growing profitably without the need for traditional base rate increases 
njng  working together with the bpu and the new jersey division of the ratepayer advocate  has been able to accomplish this goal for more than years through several key initiatives including managing its customer growth  which is expected to total about percent annually 
generating earnings from various bpu authorized gross margin sharing incentive programs  which have been extended through reducing the impact of weather on njng s earnings through an updated weather normalization clause wnc 
managing the volatility of wholesale natural gas prices through a hedging program to help keep customers prices as stable as possible 
improving its cost structure through various productivity initiatives  as well as lowering its cost of capital 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as a regulated company  njng is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements 
as a result  significant costs are deferred and treated as regulatory assets pending bpu decisions regarding their ultimate recovery from customers 
the most significant costs incurred that are subject to this accounting treatment include manufactured gas plant mgp remediation costs and wholesale natural gas costs 
actual remediation costs may vary from management s estimates due to the developing nature of remediation requirements and related litigation 
see item legal proceedings manufactured gas plant remediation and long branch mgp site litigation 
if there are changes in the regulatory position on the recovery of these costs  such costs would be charged to income 
the energy services segment focuses on providing wholesale energy services  including base load natural gas services  peaking services and balancing services  utilizing physical assets it controls  as well as natural gas management services to third parties 
njres contribution to earnings has increased over the past several years due primarily to increases in its portfolio of pipeline and storage capacity  the volatile nature of wholesale natural gas prices and higher management fees 
the volatile nature of wholesale natural gas prices over short periods of time can significantly impact njres revenue and gross margin 
furthermore  gross margin for njres is generally greater during the winter months  while the fixed costs of its capacity assets are generally spread throughout the year 
future growth is expected to come from opportunities that include the acquisition of additional storage and pipeline capacity assets and portfolio management services for third parties 
see item legal proceedings stagecoach marketing agreement 
in the retail and other segment  njrhs is focused on growing its installation business and expanding its service contract customer base 
cr r seeks additional opportunities to enhance the value of its undeveloped land 
in the conduct of the company s business  management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on the company s future financial results 
njr s policy is to work with all stakeholders  including customers  regulators and policymakers  to achieve favorable results 
these factors include the rate of njng s customer growth in its service territory  which can be influenced by general economic conditions as well as political and regulatory policies that may impact the new housing market 
a portion of njng s customer growth comes from the conversion market  which is influenced by the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels  interest rates and other economic conditions 
while the impact of weather on njng s gross margin has been significantly mitigated due to the wnc  significant variations from normal weather  which affect customer usage patterns  can impact njng s gross margin 
njng s operating expenses are heavily influenced by labor costs  a large component of which are covered by a recently negotiated collective bargaining agreement that expires in labor related fringe benefit costs  which are also subject to numerous factors  may also influence the company s results 
due to the capital intensive nature of njng s operations and the seasonal nature of njr s working capital requirements  significant changes in interest rates can also impact njr s results 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies management believes that it exercises good judgment in selecting and applying accounting principles 
the consolidated financial statements of njr include estimates  and actual results in the future may differ from such estimates 
njr s critical accounting policies are described below 
regulatory assets and liabilities njr s largest subsidiary  njng  maintains its accounts in accordance with the uniform system of accounts as prescribed by the bpu 
as a result of the ratemaking process  njng is required to follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas and  consequently  the accounting principles applied by njng differ in certain respects from those applied by unregulated businesses 
njng is required under sfas to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements 
njng s basic gas supply service bgss requires it to project its natural gas costs and provides the ability  subject to bpu approval  to recover or refund the difference  if any  of such projected costs as compared with the costs included in prices through a bgss charge to customers 
any underrecovery or overrecovery is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflected in the bgss in subsequent years 
njng also enters into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases  and the offset to the resulting derivative assets or liabilities is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the bgss  other regulatory assets consist primarily of remediation costs associated with mgp sites  which are discussed below under environmental costs  and the wnc  which are also subject to bpu approval 
if there are changes in future regulatory positions that indicate the recovery of such regulatory assets is not probable  the related cost would be charged to income 
derivatives derivative activities are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  under which njr records the fair value of derivatives held as assets and liabilities 
njr s unregulated subsidiaries record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of common stock equity 
under sfas  njr also has certain derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges 
the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in gas purchases on the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  the changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting are recorded as increases or decreases in natural gas costs or interest expense  as applicable  based on the nature of the derivatives 
njng s derivatives that are used to hedge its natural gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its bgss  subject to bpu approval 
accordingly  the offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
njr has not designated any derivatives as fair value hedges as of september  the fair value of derivative investments is determined by reference to quoted market prices of listed contracts  published quotations or quotations from independent parties 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in providing its unregulated wholesale energy services  njres enters into physical contracts to buy and sell natural gas 
these contracts qualify as normal purchases and sales under sfas  in that they provide for the purchase or sale of natural gas that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by njres over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  njres accounts for these contracts under settlement accounting 
environmental costs at the end of each fiscal year  njng updates the environmental review of its mgp sites  including a review of its potential liability for investigation and remedial action  based on assistance from an outside consulting firm 
based on the review  njng estimates expenditures to remediate and monitor these mgp sites  exclusive of any insurance recoveries 
njng s estimate of these liabilities is based upon then currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
where available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the liability  it is njng s policy to accrue the full amount of such estimate 
where the information is sufficient to establish only a range of probable liability  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  it is njng s policy to accrue the lower end of the range 
since njng believes that recovery of these expenditures  as well as related litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  in accordance with sfas  it has recorded a regulatory asset corresponding to the accrued liability 
the actual costs to be incurred by njng are dependent upon several factors  including final determination of remedial action  changing technologies and governmental regulations  the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay  the impact of litigation and any insurance recoveries 
if there are changes in future regulatory positions that indicate the recovery of all or a portion of such regulatory asset is not probable  the related cost would be charged to income 
as of september   million of previously incurred remediation costs  net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received and anticipated  are included in regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
also included in regulatory assets at september   are million of accrued future remediation costs 
unbilled revenue revenues related to the sale of natural gas are generally recorded when natural gas is delivered to customers 
however  determining natural gas sales to individual customers is based on reading their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of natural gas delivered to customers since the date of the last meter read are estimated  and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on natural gas delivered monthly into the system  unaccounted for natural gas based on historical results and applicable customer rates 
postretirement employee benefits njr s costs of providing postretirement employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
postretirement employee benefit costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued made to the plans and the return on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future postretirement employee benefit costs 
postretirement employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligations pbo 
in determining the pbo and cost amounts  assumptions can change from period to period  which could result in material changes to net postretirement employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized by njr 
njr s postretirement employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of us equity securities  international equity securities and fixed income investments  with a targeted allocation of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
fluctuations in actual market returns as well as changes in interest rates may result in increased or decreased postretirement employee benefit costs in future periods 
postretirement employee benefit expenses are included in o m expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the following is a summary of a sensitivity analysis for each actuarial assumption 
pension plans actuarial assumptions current increase estimated decrease on pbo thousands estimated decrease to expense thousands discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a other postretirement benefits actuarial assumptions current increase estimated decrease on pbo thousands estimated decrease to expense thousands discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a new accounting policies the company did not change any of its existing accounting policies in the company has discussed new accounting standards and their impact or potential impact in note summary of significant accounting policies new accounting standards 
results of operations consolidated net income increased percent to million in  percent to million in and percent to million in the increase in was attributable primarily to higher gross margin at njres generated from its portfolio of storage and transportation capacity as well as higher new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management fees  and continued customer growth at njng  which more than offset the impact of last year s colder than normal weather 
the increase in was attributable to continued profitable customer growth in njng  colder weather and higher wholesale marketing results at njres 
dividends declared per share increased percent to in  percent to in and percent to in natural gas distribution operations njng is a local natural gas distribution company that provides regulated retail energy services to more than  residential and commercial customers in central and northern new jersey and participates in the off system sales and capacity release markets 
njng s goal is to manage its growth without filing traditional base rate cases in order to provide competitive prices to its customers 
in february  the electric discount and energy competition act edeca  which provides the framework for the restructuring of new jersey s energy markets  became law 
in march  the bpu issued an order to fully open njng s residential markets to competition  restructure its rates to segregate its bgss and delivery ie  transportation service prices as required by edeca and expand an incentive for residential and small commercial customers to switch to transportation service 
njng earns no gross margin on the commodity portion of its natural gas sales 
njng earns gross margin through the transportation of natural gas to its customers 
in january  the bpu ordered that bgss could be provided by suppliers other than the state s natural gas utilities  but bgss should be provided by the state s natural gas utilities until further bpu action 
njng s financial results are summarized as follows thousands revenue gross margin residential and commercial transportation total firm gross margin incentive programs interruptible total gross margin operation and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization other taxes not reflected in gross margin operating income other income interest charges  net net income new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross margin njng s gross margin is defined as natural gas revenues less natural gas purchases  sales tax  a transitional energy facilities assessment tefa  which is included in energy and other taxes on the consolidated statements of income  and regulatory rider expenses 
regulatory rider expenses consist of recovery of state mandated programs and the remediation adjustment clause costs 
these expenses are designed to be primarily offset by corresponding revenues 
management believes that gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than revenue since natural gas costs  sales tax  tefa and regulatory rider expenses are passed through to customers  and therefore  have no effect on gross margin 
natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices in njng s bgss tariff  approved by the bpu 
the bgss price includes projected natural gas costs  net of supplier refunds  the impact of hedging activities and credits from nonfirm sales and transportation activities 
any underrecoveries or overrecoveries from the projected amounts are deferred and reflected in the bgss in subsequent years 
sales tax is calculated at percent of revenue and excludes sales to cogeneration facilities  other utilities  off system sales and federal accounts 
tefa is calculated on a per therm basis and excludes sales to cogeneration facilities  other utilities and off system sales 
regulatory rider expenses are calculated on a per therm basis 
sales tax and tefa  which are presented gross in the consolidated statements of income  totaled million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the increases each year were due primarily to the corresponding increases in revenues 
regulatory rider expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the increases were due primarily to higher rates associated with the universal service fund 
firm gross margin gross margin from residential and commercial customers is impacted by the wnc  which provides for a revenue adjustment if the weather varies by more than one half percent from normal weather ie  year average 
on october   the bpu approved njng s request to update factors used in the wnc 
several components of the calculation had not been adjusted to reflect njng s growth since the conclusion of njng s last traditional base rate case in january updating the consumption factors has made the resulting calculations from the wnc more effective in mitigating the impact of weather 
the accumulated adjustment from one heating season ie  october through may is billed or credited to customers in subsequent periods 
this mechanism reduces the variability of both customers bills and njng s earnings due to weather fluctuations 
customers switching between sales service and transportation service affect the components of gross margin from firm customers 
njng s total gross margin is not negatively affected by customers who use its transportation service and purchase natural gas from another supplier because its tariff is designed so that no profit is earned on the commodity portion of sales to firm customers 
all customers who purchase natural gas from another supplier continue to use njng for transportation service 
total firm gross margin decreased million  or less than percent  in  due primarily to percent warmer weather compared with  which was partially offset by continued customer growth 
total firm gross margin increased million  or percent  in due primarily to new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percent colder weather compared with and continued customer growth  which more than offset the impact of the wnc 
njng added  and  new customers and added natural gas heat and other services to another  and  existing customers in and  respectively 
this customer growth represents an estimated annual increase of approximately billion cubic feet bcf in sales to firm customers  assuming normal weather 
the weather in was percent warmer than normal  which resulted in no deferral or accrual of any gross margin to customers under the wnc 
in accordance with a bpu order  njng applied a million cumulative wnc credit  during  to other clauses that are were in an underrecovered position 
the weather in was percent colder than normal  which  in accordance with the wnc  resulted in the deferral of million of gross margin to be credited in the future to njng s customers 
njng estimates that in the colder weather resulted in approximately million of additional gross margin beyond the amount captured in the wnc 
the weather in was percent warmer than normal  which in accordance with the wnc  resulted in the accrual of million of gross margin for recovery from customers in the future 
njng estimates that in  the warm weather resulted in million of lost margin beyond the amount captured in the wnc 
gross margin from sales to residential and commercial customers increased million  or percent  in and million  or percent  in the increase in was due primarily to customers switching to firm sales service from transportation and continued customer growth 
the increase in was due primarily to the colder weather and customer additions 
sales to residential and commercial customers were bcf in  compared with bcf in and bcf in gross margin from transportation service decreased million  or percent  in and increased million  or percent  in the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in customers utilizing the transportation service and warmer weather 
the increase in was due primarily to an increase in customers utilizing the transportation service and colder weather 
njng transported bcf for its firm customers in  compared with bcf in and bcf in njng had  and  residential customers and  and  commercial customers using its transportation service at september  and  respectively 
the decrease in transportation customers was due primarily to price volatility in the marketplace  which led to a decrease in third party marketing efforts in njng s service territory 
in and  njng currently expects to add approximately  new customers each year and convert an additional existing customers each year to natural gas heat and other services 
achieving these expectations would represent an estimated annual customer growth rate of approximately percent and result in an estimated sales increase of approximately bcf annually  assuming normal weather and average use 
it is believed that this growth would increase gross margin under present base rates by approximately million annually 
these growth expectations are based upon management s review of local planning board data  recent market research performed by third parties  builder surveys and studies of population growth rates in njng s service territory 
however  future sales will be affected by the weather  economic conditions in njng s service territory  conversion and conservation activity  the impact of changing new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued from a regulated to a competitive environment  changes in state regulation and other marketing efforts  as has been the case in prior years 
incentive programs to reduce the overall cost of its natural gas supply commitments  njng has entered into contracts to sell natural gas to wholesale customers outside its franchise territory when the natural gas is not needed for system requirements 
these off system sales enable njng to spread its fixed demand costs  which are charged by pipelines to access their supplies year round  over a larger and more diverse customer base 
njng also participates in the capacity release market on the interstate pipeline network when the capacity is not needed for its firm system requirements 
on october   the bpu approved the extension of an incentive related to these programs through october   whereby njng retains percent of the gross margin from these sales  with percent credited to firm customers through the bgss 
under a portfolio enhancing program  which is designed to reduce the fixed cost of njng s natural gas supply portfolio  any savings achieved through the permanent reduction or replacement of capacity or other services has been shared between customers and shareowners 
under this program  njng retained percent of the savings for the first months following any transaction and percent for the remaining period through december   with percent and percent  respectively  credited to firm sales customers through the bgss 
on october   the bpu approved an agreement whereby any transactions under this program entered into before december   would continue to receive sharing treatment between customers and shareowners until april  this bpu action also provided for the parties to evaluate the appropriateness of a new capacity reliability incentive for the bpu s consideration by october  included in the june   bgss filing  njng indicated a desire to develop a capacity reliability incentive that would be discussed further during the initial review of the storage incentive program 
this review is expected to begin in january njng believes that the elimination of this program would not have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the financial risk management frm program is designed to provide price stability to njng s natural gas supply portfolio 
the frm program includes an incentive mechanism designed to encourage the use of financial instruments to hedge njng s natural gas costs  with an percent sharing of the costs and results between customers and shareowners  respectively 
on october   this program was extended through october  the bpu also approved  on october   a pilot for a new storage incentive program that will share gains and losses on an percent basis between customers and shareowners  respectively 
this program  which is subject to review after one year of operation  will measure the difference between the actual cost of natural gas in storage and a benchmark applicable to the april through october injection season 
management believes that this program will be extended through october  njng s incentive programs totaled bcf and generated million of gross margin in  compared with bcf and million of gross margin in and bcf and million of gross margin in the increase in gross margin in was due primarily to higher off system sales combined with the new storage incentive program 
the increase in gross margin in was due new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued primarily to the permanent reduction in fixed demand costs  which is part of the portfolio enhancing program discussed above 
the increase in sales in was due primarily to the optimization of the existing supply portfolio and warmer weather while considering customer supply obligations 
the decrease in sales in was due primarily to the colder weather  which required more of njng s capacity to be used for firm sales 
interruptible njng serves customers through interruptible sales and or transportation tariffs 
sales made under the interruptible sales tariff are priced on market sensitive energy parity rates 
although therms sold and transported to interruptible customers represented approximately percent of total throughput in each of  and  they accounted for less than percent of the total gross margin in each year due to the sharing formulas that govern these sales 
under these formulas  njng retains percent of the gross margin from interruptible sales and percent of the gross margin from transportation sales  with percent and percent  respectively  credited to firm sales customers through the bgss 
interruptible sales were bcf  bcf and bcf in  and  respectively 
in addition  njng transported bcf  bcf and bcf in  and  respectively  for its interruptible customers 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance o m expense decreased million  or percent  in  compared with last year  due primarily to lower allocation of expenses from affiliated companies as a result of revised allocation factors  and lower fringe benefit and advertising costs 
o m expense increased million  or percent  in  compared with  due primarily to higher labor  pension  other postretirement benefits  insurance  bad debt and community related expenses 
operating income operating income increased million  or percent  in  compared with last year  due primarily to the lower o m expense described above 
operating income increased million  or percent  in  compared with  due primarily to the increase in gross margin described earlier  which more than offset o m increases that year 
net income net income increased million  or percent  in due primarily to the higher operating income discussed above and higher other income 
the increase in other income is due primarily to higher interest income associated with various regulatory riders  which more than offset increased interest expense due to higher average long term debt outstanding 
net income increased million  or percent  in compared with  due primarily to the higher operating income discussed above and lower interest expense 
this was partially offset by higher income taxes  caused by the increase in pretax income  and a decrease in deferred carrying costs on regulatory assets  included in other income  caused by lower interest rates

natural gas sold and managed by njres totaled bcf in  compared with bcf in and bcf in the decrease in was due primarily to the expiration of the transportation contract described above 
njres gross margin is defined as natural gas revenues and management fees less natural gas costs 
njres gross margin increased in  due primarily to sales generated within its portfolio of storage and transportation capacity contracts  as well as higher management fees associated with njres management of other companies storage  transportation and fuel contracts  including the stagecoach natural gas storage project stagecoach

the company currently has a million share repurchase plan 
as of september   the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
the increase in short term debt at september   was due primarily to higher working capital requirements caused by an increase in wholesale natural gas prices 
in october  njr entered into agreements with several banks  providing million of uncommitted credit facilities to meet njres rising working capital requirements caused by rising wholesale natural gas futures prices 
in december  njr entered into a million committed credit facility with several banks  which replaced a million credit facility
