item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business 
sonic operates and franchises the largest chain of drive ins in the united states and also has a small number of franchise drive ins in mexico 
as of august   the sonic system was comprised of  drive ins  of which were partner drive ins and  were franchise drive ins 
sonic drive ins feature sonic signature items such as made to order sandwiches and hamburgers  extra long cheese coneys  salads  hand battered onion rings  tater tots  specialty soft drinks including cherry limeades and slushes  and frozen desserts 
we derive our revenues primarily from partner drive in sales and royalty fees from franchisees 
we also receive revenues from initial franchise fees and the selling and leasing of signs and real estate 
in addition  we also own and receive income from a minority ownership interest in a few franchise drive ins 
costs of partner drive in sales  including minority interest in earnings of drive ins  relate directly to partner drive in sales 
other expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  and general and administrative expenses  relate to partner drive in operations  as well as the company s franchising operations 
our revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of partner drive ins 
our revenues and  to a lesser extent  expenses also are affected by the number and sales volumes of franchise drive ins 
initial franchise fees and franchise royalties are directly affected by the number of franchise drive in openings 
overview of business performance 
business performance was strong during fiscal year as net income increased and earnings per share increased to per diluted share 
we continue to experience considerable momentum in our business fueled by strong growth in same store sales that  despite some pressure on commodity costs during the year  led to a significant increase in system wide average profit per store 
the rise in store level profits  in turn  helped produce a record number of new drive in openings by franchisees 
we believe these results reflect our multi layered growth strategy that features the following components o solid same store sales growth  o increased franchising income stemming from our unique ascending royalty rate  o expansion of the sonic brand through new unit growth particularly by franchisees  o operating leverage at both the drive in level and the corporate level  and o the use of excess operating cash flow for franchise acquisitions and share repurchases 
the following table provides information regarding the number of partner drive ins and franchise drive ins in operation as of the end of the periods indicated as well as the system wide growth in sales and average unit volume 
system wide information includes both partner drive in and franchise drive in information  which we believe is useful in analyzing the growth of the brand as well as the company s revenues since franchisees pay royalties based on a percentage of sales

represents percentage change for drive ins open for a minimum of months 
system wide same store sales increased during fiscal year  primarily as a result of traffic growth an increase in the number of transactions across all day parts eg morning  lunch  afternoon  dinner  and evening 
we believe this strong sales performance was not only the result of generally more favorable industry and consumer conditions but was also a consequence of our specific sales driving initiatives including o growth in brand awareness through increased media spending and greater use of network cable advertising  o strong promotions and new product news focused on quality and expanded choices for our customers  and o continued growth of our business in non traditional day parts including the morning day part  which increased significantly during the year as a percentage of sales 
during fiscal year  our total system wide media expenditures were in excess of million as compared to million in fiscal year  which we believe continues to increase overall brand awareness and strengthen our share of voice relative to our competitors 
we have also shifted more of our marketing dollars to our system wide marketing fund  which is largely used for network cable television advertising  growing this area of our advertising from just under million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year we believe this provides several benefits including the ability to target specific consumer groups more effectively and better reach the network cable audience  which has now surpassed broadcast networks in terms of viewership 
in addition  national cable advertising also allows us to bring additional depth to our marketing by expanding our media messages beyond a single monthly promotion 
looking forward  we expect system wide media expenditures to be in excess of million in fiscal  including doubling the amount spent for network cable television advertising to million 
we continue to use our monthly promotions to highlight our distinctive food offerings and to feature new products 
we also use our promotions and product news to create a strong emotional link with consumers and to align closely with consumer trends for fresh ingredients  customization  menu variety and choice 
during the past year  our new product offerings showcased the breadth of our menu and emphasized the opportunity for choice at sonic 
we featured items ranging from large  higher priced sandwiches like the smoky supersonic 
cheeseburger to better for you items such as the grilled chicken wrap with the option of a carb friendly tortilla and fresh tastes 
salads as well as our frozen and fountain favorites such as our new diet cherry limeade  frozen powerade slush  and hershey s s mores blast 
we will continue to have new product news in the coming months spanning the entire breadth of our product line and all designed to meet customers evolving taste preferences including the growing desire for fresh  quality product offerings and more healthy alternatives 
we continue to be pleased with our progress towards penetrating the morning day part through our breakfast program  which began in the summer of we expanded the program  which features unique breakfast items as well as our entire menu all day long  to the remaining of our drive ins during the spring of as a result  sales during the morning day part have grown to over of total sales 
our experience to this point continues to lead us to believe that breakfast is a gradual build requiring two to three years to achieve a desired level 
we also continue to view breakfast as instrumental in helping us grow our average unit volumes to well over million  more in the range of our larger competitors 
in addition to growth during the morning day part  we also experienced sales increases in every other day part during fiscal year  including dinner and evening business 
these day parts were the weakest during fiscal year as a result of both a disproportionate impact of weaker economic and industry conditions as well as a conscious shift in media dollars to support the breakfast day part 
our evening business rose significantly this summer as we brought back our sonic nights program  which featured an open til at least midnight message supported by national cable advertising as well as an emphasis on our frozen favorites and new products such as the hershey s s mores blast and the junior banana split 
one of the more positive developments over the last several months has been the performance of developing markets 
system wide same store sales in developing markets outpaced same store sales in core markets increasing during fiscal year compared to a decline of in fiscal year we believe that this was due to increased spending on national cable  which seems to have benefited all of our markets  and particularly our developing markets 
from an average unit volume standpoint  developing markets  which represent roughly of the store base  increased reversing the downward trend of the last year and slightly ahead of what we saw in core markets 
new drive in openings by franchisees reached a record level during the past year and were accompanied by ongoing improvement in our franchise development pipeline  which we believe has a direct correlation to the growth in average unit profitability 
the combination of increased new store openings by franchisees and strong same store sales performance translated into higher franchising income for the year  which was a large factor in our earnings growth since this incremental income has relatively lower associated cost 
we also continued to benefit from other positive aspects of our multi layered financial model including leverage of our corporate level expenses and positive operating cash flow 
at our partner drive ins  we have put in place long term initiatives designed to help us close the  plus sales gap in average unit volumes between partner drive ins and franchise drive ins 
to a large degree  this effort is modeled on the best practices of our top volume partner and franchise drive ins 
our intent is to complement the strong profit motive created through our partnership program with strong incentives focused on top line growth 
initial results from these efforts are encouraging  as same store sales growth at partner drive ins exceeded same store sales at franchised drive ins during each of the last three quarters 
over the past several years  we have completed the acquisition of several franchise drive ins in various markets including the acquisition of drive ins located in the san antonio  texas market in may and the acquisition of drive ins located in the denver and colorado springs  colorado markets in july these acquisitions have added to revenue growth and have been accretive to earnings over time 
our acquisitions are focused on higher volume stores with strong store level management already in place 
in addition  in each case  the selling franchisee retained a significant drive in base and is growing with us in other areas 
we continue to view these types of acquisitions of core market drive ins with proven track records as a very good  lower risk use of our capital and they remain a very viable potential use of our excess cash flow in future years 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in revenues primarily relates to strong sales growth for partner drive ins and  to a lesser extent  a rise in franchising income 
revenues in thousands year ended august  increase decrease percent increase decrease revenues partner drive in sales    franchise revenues franchise royalties    franchise fees   other   total revenues    year ended august  increase decrease percent increase decrease revenues partner drive in sales    franchise revenues franchise royalties    franchise fees   other   total revenues    the following table reflects the growth in partner drive in sales and changes in comparable drive in sales for partner drive ins 
it also presents information about average unit volumes and the number of partner drive ins  which is useful in analyzing the growth of partner drive in sales

represents percentage change for drive ins open since the beginning of fiscal year partner drive in sales increased million in fiscal year  of which million resulted from the net addition of partner drive ins since the beginning of fiscal year million from the addition of newly constructed and acquired drive ins less million from drive ins sold or closed during the period 
same store sales increases accounted for million of the increase 
during fiscal year  partner drive in sales increased million  of which million resulted from the net addition of partner drive ins during fiscal years and million from the addition of newly constructed and acquired drive ins less million from drive ins sold or closed during the period 
the increase in partner drive in sales from the net addition of drive ins was partially offset by slight sales decreases in the amount of 
million by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal years and during fiscal year  same store sales at partner drive ins exceeded the same store sales performance of franchise drive ins 
the increase in average unit volume was even stronger growing during the year as a result of the acquisition of higher volume drive ins in san antonio and colorado in may and july  respectively  as well as continued strong performance from new store openings 
the following table reflects the growth in franchise revenues franchise royalties and franchise fees as well as franchise sales  average unit volumes and the number of franchise drive ins 
while we do not record franchise drive in sales as revenues  we believe this information is important in understanding our financial performance since these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record franchise royalties 
this information is also indicative of the financial performance of our franchise drive ins

franchise income  which consists of franchise royalties and franchise fees  increased to million in fiscal year franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million resulted from franchise drive ins same store sales growth of in fiscal year  combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year each of our license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate whereby royalties  as a percentage of sales  increase as sales increase 
the balance of the increase was attributable to growth in the number of franchise drive ins over the prior period 
franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million during fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of franchise drive ins operating in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in the effective royalty rate from in fiscal year to in fiscal year as substantially all of the new stores opened under the newest license agreement  which has a higher average royalty rate 
franchise fees increased to million as franchisees opened new drive ins in fiscal year as compared to openings in fiscal year franchise fees increased to million during fiscal as franchise drive ins opened compared to during the previous year 
at august   we had franchise area development agreements compared to such agreements at august  we anticipate to store openings by franchisees during fiscal year substantially all of these new drive ins will open under our newest form of license agreement  which contains a higher average royalty rate and initial opening fee 
as a result of these new franchise drive in openings and the continued benefit of the ascending royalty rate  we expect approximately to million in incremental franchise income in fiscal year operating expenses 
overall  drive in cost of operations  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year minority interest in earnings of drive ins is included as a part of cost of sales  in the table below  since it is directly related to partner drive in cost of operations 
operating margins year ended august  cost and expenses partner drive ins food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits minority interest in earnings of drive ins other operating expenses total drive in cost of operations as a percentage of partner drive in sales 
after remaining flat during fiscal year  food and packaging costs increased  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  during fiscal year as a result of higher unit level costs for most commodities  which offset the benefit of price increases taken during the year 
the pressure on commodity prices is expected to continue for the next several months and as a result we expect our food and packaging costs  as a percentage of sales  will continue to be higher on a year over year basis 
labor costs increased  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  during fiscal year following a increase in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of significant payments made under a new sales incentive bonus program for drive in management as well as higher staffing levels reflecting successful ongoing efforts to reduce turnover at partner drive ins 
the increase during primarily resulted from increased investment in store level labor  particularly assistant managers  as well as higher worker s compensation and health insurance costs 
looking forward  we will continue to benefit from a relatively flat average wage rate and we expect to continue making significant payments under our sales incentive program 
however  we will be modifying the program to add a profit qualifier to enhance flow through from the incremental sales 
as a result of that change and lapping the beginning of the sales incentive bonus program that began in september  the opportunity to leverage labor costs  as a percentage of sales  during the next fiscal year is more favorable 
minority interest  which reflects our store level partners pro rata share of earnings from our partnership program  increased by million during fiscal year as the increase in average dollar profit per store more than offset the decline in drive in level margins 
during fiscal year  lower average unit profits combined with declining drive in level margins resulted in a million decrease in minority interest 
overall  we continue to view the partnership program as an integral part of our culture at sonic and a large factor in the success of our business  and we are pleased that profit distributions to our partners increased during fiscal year since we expect our average store level profits to continue to grow in fiscal year and we expect less margin pressure  we would expect minority interest to increase in real terms but stay relatively flat as a percentage of sales 
other operating expenses improved  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  by during fiscal year as the leverage of operating at higher unit volumes more than offset increased costs 
in real dollar terms  the increase in other operating expenses in fiscal year was comprised of several factors including higher marketing expenditures  utilities  credit card charges resulting from an increase in customer credit card usage  and a fairly sharp increase in repair and maintenance expense as we have focused on the physical appearance of our stores  both inside and out 
while we expect cost increases in many of the items listed above to carry over into fiscal year  we anticipate that the benefit of operating at higher unit volumes will lead to an improvement in other operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  over the next few quarters 
during fiscal year  other operating expenses  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  deteriorated primarily as a result of the lack of growth in average store volumes  an increase in the rate of advertising contributions in preparation for the breakfast rollout and rent expense related to the acquisition of franchise drive ins where the franchisee retained the real estate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal year and to million during fiscal year however  we continue to see leverage as the growth in these expenses was considerably less than the growth in revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year and in fiscal year we anticipate that these costs will increase in the range of to in fiscal year but expect them to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year due  in part  to additional depreciation stemming from the san antonio and colorado acquisitions  as well as the capital lease on our new corporate office space 
similarly  depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year as a result of new drive in development and acquisitions of existing franchise drive ins 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million in fiscal year looking forward  with to million in capital expenditures planned for fiscal year  we expect depreciation and amortization to increase in the range of to for the year 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
one partner drive in became impaired during fiscal year under the guidelines of fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  a provision for impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded for the drive in s carrying cost in excess of its estimated fair value 
two partner drive ins became impaired during fiscal year which resulted in a provision for impairment of million to reduce the drive ins carrying cost to their estimated fair value 
during fiscal year  two partner drive ins became impaired and estimates were revised on two stores that were previously impaired  resulting in a provision for impairment of million 
we continue to perform quarterly analyses of certain underperforming drive ins 
it is reasonably possible that the estimate of future cash flows associated with these drive ins may change in the near future resulting in the need to write down assets associated with one or more of these drive ins to fair value 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased in fiscal year compared to a decrease in fiscal year while interest expense increased in fiscal year largely due to the addition of the capital lease associated with our new office space  a continued favorable interest rate environment combined with the refinancing of million in senior notes that occurred in april of fiscal year and reduced borrowing levels in fiscal year mostly offset the increase 
our ability to generate positive operating cash flow enabled us to expend million in capital expenditures  million in share repurchases and still reduce our long term debt by million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we outsourced the financing of our partner notes to a third party financial institution in an effort to strengthen our partnership program  which will result in a decrease in interest income in the range of million annually 
going forward  we expect our strong cash flow and reduced borrowing levels to mitigate the reduction in interest income associated with the partner notes to produce slightly higher net interest expense in fiscal year income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal year compared with in fiscal years and the reduction in our effective tax rate in fiscal year was primarily a result of the benefit of higher tax credits 
going forward  new interpretive accounting guidance will likely result in greater variability in our tax rate from quarter to quarter as circumstances on individual tax matters change 
however  overall we anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat or decrease slightly during fiscal year financial position during fiscal year  current assets decreased to million compared to million as of the end of fiscal year as excess cash was used  in part  to fund capital expenditures  the colorado acquisition  and to repay long term debt 
notes receivable was reduced as a result of the outsourcing of our partner notes to a third party financial institution in the amount of million 
net property  equipment and goodwill increased by as a result of capital expenditures  drive in acquisitions  and the addition of the capital lease for our new corporate office facilities  which combined with the reduction in current assets and notes receivable to produce a increase in total assets to million as of the end of fiscal year total current liabilities increased million or during fiscal year as a result of a number of factors including obligations relating to the colorado acquisition  an increase in health insurance and other accrued liabilities  franchise deposits and trade payables 
the net increase in capital lease obligations of million  which primarily relates to the lease obligation on the new headquarters building  was more than offset by the net repayment of long term debt in the amount of million 
overall  total liabilities decreased million or as a result of the items discussed above 
stockholders equity increased million or during fiscal year primarily resulting from earnings during the period of million 
proceeds and the related tax benefit from the exercise of stock options accounted for the balance of the increase 
at the end of fiscal year  our debt to total capital ratio stood at  down from at the end of fiscal year for the twelve months ended august   return on average stockholder s equity was and return on average assets was liquidity and sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities increased million or to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of an increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization and the provision for deferred income taxes 
we also anticipate continuing to generate increasing positive free cash flow going forward 
we believe free cash flow  which we define as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures  is useful in evaluating the liquidity of the company by assessing the level of funds available for share repurchases  acquisitions of franchise drive ins  and repayment of debt 
we expect free cash flow to exceed million for fiscal year we have an agreement with a group of banks that provides us with a million line of credit expiring in july as of august   our outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were million  at an effective borrowing rate of  as well as million in outstanding letters of credit 
the amount available under the line of credit as of august   was million 
we have long term debt maturing in fiscal years and of million and million  respectively 
we plan to refinance million of long term debt under our senior unsecured notes that will be maturing in april using amounts available under our line of credit 
we also plan to extend the amounts maturing in under the line of credit 
we believe that free cash flow will be adequate for repayment of any long term debt that does not get refinanced or extended 
we plan to use the line of credit to finance the opening of newly constructed drive ins  acquisitions of existing drive ins  purchases of the company s common stock and for other general corporate purposes  as needed 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
as we announced in august  our board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization and extended the program to december  we made approximately million in share repurchases during fiscal year  all of which were acquired during the fourth quarter 
as of august   we had million available under the program 
we opened newly constructed partner drive ins and acquired a net of drive ins from franchisees during fiscal year we funded total capital additions for fiscal year of million  which included the cost of newly opened drive ins  new equipment for existing drive ins  drive ins under construction  the acquisition of franchise drive ins  and other capital expenditures  from cash generated by operating activities  borrowings under our line of credit  and seller provided financing for the colorado acquisition 
during fiscal year  we purchased the real estate for of the newly constructed and acquired drive ins 
we also sold real estate for cash in the amount of million relating to drive ins previously sold to franchisees 
we plan capital expenditures of approximately to million in fiscal year  excluding potential acquisitions and share repurchases 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to the development of additional partner drive ins  stall additions  relocations of older drive ins  store equipment and point of sale system upgrades  and enhancements to existing financial and operating information systems 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our existing line of credit 
we entered into an agreement with certain franchisees during fiscal year  which provides them with the option to sell drive ins to us anytime during the period commencing january  and ending june  we estimate that the cost of the acquisition  if it were to occur  would be in the range of to million and anticipate that the acquisition would be funded through operating cash flows and borrowings under our existing line of credit 
as of august   our total cash balance of million reflected the impact of the cash generated from operating activities  borrowing activity  and capital expenditures mentioned above 
we believe that existing cash and funds generated from operations  as well as borrowings under the line of credit  will meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  sonic enters into purchase contracts  lease agreements and borrowing arrangements 
our commitments and obligations as of august  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt      capital leases      operating leases      vendor purchase agreements   total      impact of inflation though increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
seasonality we do not expect seasonality to affect our operations in a materially adverse manner 
our results during the second fiscal quarter the months of december  january and february generally are lower than other quarters because of the climate of the locations of a number of partner and franchise drive ins 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in this document contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use its judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of risk  judgment and or complexity 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review each drive in for impairment when events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
we test for impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  at least annually  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our brand and drive ins 
these impairment tests require us to estimate fair values of our brand and our drive ins by making assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
ownership program allowance for uncollectible notes and accounts receivable 
our drive in philosophy stresses an ownership relationship with supervisors and drive in managers 
most supervisors and managers of partner drive ins own an equity interest in the drive in  which was previously financed by the company 
we outsourced the financing of partner notes to a third party in the fourth fiscal quarter of supervisors and managers are not employees of sonic or of the drive in in which they have an ownership interest 
the investments made by managers and supervisors in each partnership or limited liability company are accounted for as minority interests in the financial statements 
the ownership agreements contain provisions  which give sonic the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority interest of the supervisor or manager in a drive in 
the amount of the investment made by a partner and the amount of the buy out are based on a number of factors  primarily upon the drive in s financial performance for the preceding months  and are intended to approximate the fair value of a minority interest in the drive in 
the net book value of a minority interest acquired by the company in a partner drive in is recorded as an investment in partnership  which results in a reduction in the minority interest liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the purchase price exceeds the net book value of the assets underlying the partnership interest  the excess is recorded as goodwill 
the acquisition of a minority interest for less than book value results in a decrease in purchased goodwill 
any subsequent sale of the minority interest to another minority partner is recorded as a pro rata reduction of goodwill and investment  and no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of the minority ownership interest 
goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of minority interests in partner drive ins is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment under the provisions of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we collect royalties from franchisees and provide for estimated losses for receivables that are not likely to be collected 
general allowances for uncollectible receivables are estimated based on historical trends 
although we have a good relationship with our franchisees and collection rates are currently high  if average sales or the financial health of franchisees were to deteriorate  we may have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
contingency reserves 
from time to time  we are involved in various legal proceedings and have certain unresolved claims pending involving taxing authorities  franchisees  suppliers  employees  competitors and others 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as estimate potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each issue 
in addition  our estimate of probable losses may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
based on the information currently available  we believe that all claims currently pending are either covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
advertising 
under our license agreements  both partner drive ins and franchise drive ins must contribute a minimum percentage of revenues to a national media production fund sonic advertising fund and spend an additional minimum percentage of gross revenues on local advertising  either directly or through company required participation in advertising cooperatives 
a portion of the local advertising contributions is redistributed to the system marketing fund  which purchases advertising on national cable and broadcast networks and other national media and sponsorship opportunities 
as stated in the terms of existing license agreements  these funds do not constitute assets of the company and the company acts with limited agency in the administration of these funds 
accordingly  neither the revenues and expenses nor the assets and liabilities of the advertising cooperatives  the sonic advertising fund  or the system marketing fund are included in our consolidated financial statements 
however  all advertising contributions by partner drive ins are recorded as an expense in the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition related to franchise fees and royalties 
initial franchise fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income when we have substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the sale of the franchise 
area development fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income on a pro rata basis when the conditions for revenue recognition under the individual development agreements are met 
both initial franchise fees and area development fees are generally recognized upon the opening of a franchise drive in or upon termination of the agreement between sonic and the franchisee 
our franchisees are required under the provisions of the license agreements to pay sonic royalties each month based on a percentage of actual net sales 
however  the royalty payments and supporting financial statements are not due until the th of the following month 
as a result  we accrue royalty revenue in the month earned based on estimates of franchise drive in sales 
these estimates are based on actual sales at partner drive ins and projections of average unit volume growth at franchise drive ins 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liability 
in making this estimate  we consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we will update our estimate  which could result in an adjustment to the tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and notes receivable  as well as changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of our senior notes  outstanding line of credit  and notes receivable 
the senior notes bear interest at fixed rates which average 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of august  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
as of august   the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was million as of august  the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balances under the line of credit as of the end of fiscal year would be approximately million 
we have made certain loans to our franchisees totaling million as of august  the interest rates on these notes are generally between and 
we believe the fair market value of these notes approximates their carrying amount 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps  however  we have not made any long term commitments to purchase any minimum quantities under these arrangements 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase agreements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
