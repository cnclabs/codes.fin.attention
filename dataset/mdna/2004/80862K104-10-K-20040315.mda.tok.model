this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
see note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in this annual report on form k 
overview our current primary business objective is to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize zadaxin in the major pharmaceutical markets of the united states  europe and japan 
our long term business objective is to be a leading biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat life threatening diseases 
during the periods encompassed by this annual report on form k  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our zadaxin clinical trials and our zadaxin commercialization activities 
our primary focus has been the clinical development of zadaxin as a part of a new combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we believe that the worldwide market for hcv therapies was approximately billion in and could exceed billion in and that the united states  europe and japan account for essentially all of this market opportunity 
currently  there are only two approved and marketed therapies for hepatitis c  interferon alpha predominantly in pegylated forms and ribavirin in combination with interferon alpha 
two large pharmaceutical companies  schering plough and roche  each market their brands of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin and dominate the hepatitis c therapeutic market 
our strategy is to develop zadaxin to be used in combination with and to improve the efficacy of current therapy  and we are currently conducting in the united states two phase hepatitis c clinical trials of zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon 
we intend to complete these trials by the end of and  if successful  file a nda in mid we are also developing zadaxin in japan as a monotherapy for the treatment of hepatitis b 
we completed a phase clinical trial there in and are targeting to file a nda in japan by the end of we estimate the worldwide market for hbv therapeutics was approximately million in and is expected to increase to over billion in the largest market for hepatitis b therapies is asia where we have regulatory approval in several countries 
our commercialization and marketing activities to date have been concentrated on china 
we believe that our ability to significantly expand the zadaxin sales opportunities in the developing countries in the future will depend on our securing regulatory approval in the united states  europe or japan 
we manufacture zadaxin for sale  and for our clinical trials  through third party contract manufacturers  and we conduct our research and development efforts principally through arrangements with clinical research sites  contract research organizations and universities 
from commencement of operations through december   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately  at least over the next two years  we expect net losses to increase due to increased operating expenses as we expand our research and development  clinical testing and sales and marketing capabilities 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability is primarily dependent on the execution and successful completion of zadaxin clinical trials and securing regulatory approvals for zadaxin in the united states  europe  and japan  and  if approved in those countries  the successful commercialization and marketing of zadaxin 
in addition  other factors may also impact our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability  including the pricing of zadaxin and its manufacturing and marketing costs  the cost of long term product development and commercialization programs  the timing and costs of acquiring rights to additional drugs  our ability to fund our operations and the entrance into and extension of agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate 
we expect net sales for to be lower than net sales for  as we are not anticipating any significant new source of demand for zadaxin  such as the sars epidemic in china during the second quarter of we expect quarterly net sales for to be similar to those reported for the third and fourth quarters of expected research and development expenses for are higher than research and development expenses for due to increased expenses for our phase hepatitis c clinical trials in the united states as well as for the development of scv expected net loss and net loss per share for are higher than net loss and net loss per share for based on our lower net sales estimates and higher research and development expenses 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  are expected to be lower than at december  primarily due to the expected net loss from operations 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  the number  timing  costs and results of preclinical and clinical trials of our products  market acceptance of zadaxin and the timing of orders for zadaxin from international markets  particularly china  the regulatory approval process  the timing of fda or international regulatory approvals  and the acquisition of additional product rights and the funding  if any  provided as a result of corporate partnering arrangements 
critical accounting policies general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them  and they do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we will replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
we exercise judgment in determining the period over which our performance obligations have been fulfilled which can have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue that is recognized in a particular reporting period 
revenue associated with substantive performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements and provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii there are no future performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
we exercise judgment in our determination of the achievement of milestones which can have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a particular reporting period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
we maintain reserves for credit losses  and such losses have been within our expectations 
we recognize reserves for bad debts ranging from to of past due accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our collectibility experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  an analysis of the historical payment patterns of our customers  individual customer circumstances and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an 
table of contents impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would increase our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net loss 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would decrease our general and administrative expenses and decrease our reported net loss 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in inventory reserves may be required in the future due to a change in market conditions 
we have begun production with a new contract manufacturer and are currently in the process of qualifying the product to permit its importation into china 
in the fourth quarter of we began building inventory levels to ensure an uninterrupted supply of product for our distributors in china and elsewhere 
we expect these inventory levels to decrease during the second half of if we are unable to qualify in a timely fashion the product produced by the new contract manufacturer  our inventory reserves may be insufficient and could result in an increase in inventory reserves and in net loss 
impairment of intangible assets at december   we had net intangible assets of  related to zadaxin product rights and had never recorded any impairment losses related to intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses are principally incurred for our phase clinical trials in the united states 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous institutions that conduct the clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
expenses related to grants to the institutions are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
in general  these expenses will be higher for the initial and final months of a patient s scheduled months of treatment and observation 
expenses relating to the clinical research organization managing the trials and laboratory and other direct expenses are recognized in the period they are incurred and the services performed 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates accordingly  however  if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could underestimate our actual research and development expenses  requiring the recording of additional expenses and an increase in net loss 
results of operations product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and all were derived from sales of zadaxin 
these increases were attributable to higher volume of product sold as prices have remained stable 
sales to customers in china accounted for approximately  and of this revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of the total increase in sales of  from to  approximately  was from an unanticipated temporary increase in demand for zadaxin from hospitals in china at the time of the sars outbreak during the second quarter of for each of the years ended december  through  sales to between four and six importing agents in china accounted for approximately of our product sales 
the single largest customer accounted for  and of sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
however  the importing agent who was the single largest customer varied each year 
as of december   approximately  or  of our accounts receivable were attributable to five customers in china 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and generally do not require collateral from our customers 

table of contents contract revenue was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the contract revenue we recognized was in connection with the  payment we received from sigma tau in january this revenue is recognized as contract revenue over the course of the zadaxin hepatitis c us clinical program and the period of sharing the clinical data from this program with sigma tau in accordance with the requirements under our contract with sigma tau 
gross margin was in  and in both and the increase in gross margin in was largely attributable to product related fixed costs being spread over the significantly larger volume of units sold 
we expect cost of product sales and hence gross margin to vary from year to year  depending upon the level of zadaxin sales  the absorption of product related fixed costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in each year was to support our zadaxin phase clinical trials  primarily in the united states and to a lesser extent in japan 
in  and  research and development r d expenses represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total costs and expenses 
the major components of r d expenses consist of clinical studies performed by clinical trial institutions and contract research organizations  related materials and supplies  preclinical work  pharmaceutical development  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  third party research funding  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs include phase   and clinical trials as well as expanded clinical access programs 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
during  we recorded approximately  on research   on clinical development  and  on pharmaceutical development activities 
this compares to expenses in of approximately  on research   on clinical development  and  on pharmaceutical development activities and expenses in of approximately  on research   on clinical development  and  on pharmaceutical development activities 
the initiation and continuation of our current clinical development programs has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
an expansion or significant extension of our clinical development programs may require us to seek additional capital resources 
due to the uncertain nature of the clinical trial process  and enrollment rates in particular  it is not possible to determine the timing of completion or total cost expected to be incurred for each trial 
in general  we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly at least over the next two years and to vary substantially from quarter to quarter as we pursue our strategy of initiating additional preclinical and clinical trials and testing  acquiring product rights  and expanding regulatory activities 
sales and marketing expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year to year increases from to were related to increased payroll expenses and expenses for advertising and conferences associated with the expansion of our markets for zadaxin  however  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the next several quarters and years as we expand our commercialization and marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year to year increases from to were attributable to greater general and administrative activities to support an increased level of research and development on our late stage clinical programs 
in the near term  we expect general and administrative expenses to vary quarter to quarter as we increase our general and administrative activities and resources to support increased expenditures on preclinical and clinical trials and testing  and regulatory  pre commercialization and marketing activities 
interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease over the years was primarily due to lower interest rates 
interest expense relating to  of convertible notes payable was  for the year ended december  net loss for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
net loss decreased in due to higher net sales and gross margin 
net loss in was higher than in due to an increase in research and development expenses and to a gain in of  from the full repayment on a note receivable from a former officer 
net loss per share for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
weighted average shares outstanding for the year ending december   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in the shares outstanding is primarily due to financing activities in and 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   and  we had   and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in each of these years  the principal factors affecting these balances were the net loss and cash provided by financing activities 
we currently estimate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  will be lower than the balance at december  the expected decrease in this balance is attributable to an expected net loss and no plan for a financing for the year 
the short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid marketable securities 
we have two letters of credit each secured by a certificate of deposit 
at december   the letters of credit totaled  one for  under our lease agreement  the other for  to facilitate our value added tax filings in europe 
net cash used in operating activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was more than the net loss primarily due to a  increase in inventory levels expected to provide an uninterrupted supply of zadaxin as we began production with a new contract manufacturer 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was less than the net loss primarily due to the receipt of a payment from sigma tau for a clinical trial collaboration which increased deferred revenue balances by  and due to increases in accounts payable of  partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of  mostly associated with our phase clinical trials in the united states 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  mainly attributable to a net loss from operations of  and an increase in inventory of  cash provided by investing activities is primarily the net result of purchases and sales of short term investments to provide working capital for operations 
we purchased  of property and equipment during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  from a follow on public offering of common stock  approximately  from the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock by institutional and accredited investors  approximately  from the issuance of common stock to sigma tau  approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans and  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  from a direct offering of common stock to institutional investors  approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans and  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of  in proceeds from the issuance of a convertible note   in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock   from granting an investor the right to purchase approximately  of senior unsecured convertible notes  and  from the payment on a note receivable from a former officer 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual more obligations total less than year years years than years convertible notes payable operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total  of these convertible notes mature in december and  mature in march see note of the consolidated financial statements 
included in the amounts above is  for interest payments 
these are future minimum rental commitments for office space leased under non cancelable operating lease arrangements 
this includes  per year in minimum royalty payments to the us army   per year in minimum royalty payments to the nih  approximately  in minimum purchase requirement from a contract manufacturer  approximately  in research and development fees payable to the contract research organization under our agreement for the us phase hepatitis c clinical trials 

table of contents this represents  per year in minimum royalty payments to the us army 
these are required non cancelable prepaid royalties to be paid to wayne state university 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to give priority use of our financial resources to zadaxin clinical programs in the united states 
we believe our existing capital resources and funds from product sales are sufficient to complete our current us phase clinical trials and  if the trials are successful and we receive fda approval  to begin commercialization of zadaxin in the united states 
however  we cannot assure you that such funds will be sufficient  or that sales of zadaxin  if approved in the united states  will result in profitable operations 
in the event we need to raise additional financing  the unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which would severely hurt our business 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties and the status of competitive products 
there are no officers or directors that were involved in related party transactions in off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements in  or income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire in the years through the difference between the cumulative losses for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes is primarily attributable to losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information in this report on form k  before making an investment decision 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
if we are unable to commercialize zadaxin in various markets for multiple indications  particularly in the united states for the treatment of hcv  our business will be harmed 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability depends in large part on our ability to commence  execute and complete clinical programs and obtain additional regulatory approvals  for zadaxin and other drug candidates  particularly in the united states  europe and japan 
we are also dependent on our ability to increase zadaxin sales in existing markets and launch zadaxin in new markets 
in particular  our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend in large part on our ability to commercialize zadaxin for the treatment of hcv in the united states 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve significant levels of sales or that we will receive approval for zadaxin for the treatment of hcv in the united states or for the treatment of hcv or other indications in other countries 
if we are unable to do so  our business will be harmed 

table of contents if we do not obtain regulatory approval for zadaxin for the intended indications that we are evaluating  our revenues will be limited and we will not become profitable 
our ability to execute on our business strategy requires that we obtain regulatory approval for the use of zadaxin  particularly for the treatment of hcv in the united states  both hbv and hcv in japan and both hcv and malignant melanoma in europe 
if our current phase trials in the united states and current and future trials in europe yield favorable results  we intend to submit applications for marketing approval of zadaxin for the treatment of hcv in the united states and through our partner  sigma tau  for the treatment of hcv and malignant melanoma in europe 
based on the results of our recently completed phase trial in japan  we intend to submit a regulatory filing for the treatment of hbv in japan 
the regulatory approval process in the united states  europe and japan is demanding and typically requires months or more in the united states and months or more in europe and japan from the date of submission of a new drug application 
we have committed significant resources  including capital and time  to develop zadaxin  particularly for hcv in the united states  with the goal of obtaining such approvals 
if we do not obtain these approvals  we will be unable to achieve any substantial increase in our revenue 
all new drugs  including our products  which have been developed or are under development  are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries 
these regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market approval  importation  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
these regulations may change from time to time and new regulations may be adopted 
obtaining regulatory approval in developing countries is also time consuming and expensive 
in some countries where we are contemplating marketing and selling zadaxin  the regulatory approval process often relies on prior approvals obtained in the united states  europe or japan 
without such prior approvals  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for zadaxin in these countries may be delayed or prevented 
in addition  to secure these regulatory approvals  we will need  among other things  to demonstrate favorable results from additional clinical trials of zadaxin 
even if we are able to complete the clinical trials we have sponsored or are planning in a timely or cost effective manner  these trials may not fulfill the applicable regulatory approval criteria  in which case we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval in these countries 
we cannot assure you that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approvals in our targeted countries in a timely and cost effective manner or at all 
if we fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals to develop  market and sell our products in countries where we currently do not have such rights  our revenues will be limited 
satisfaction of government regulations may take several years and the time needed to satisfy them varies substantially based on the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
as a result  government regulation may cause us to delay the introduction of  or prevent us from marketing  our existing or potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our products  such approval may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed 
unsatisfactory data resulting from clinical trials may also adversely affect our ability to market and sell zadaxin in markets where it is approved for sale 
if the results of our clinical trials are not favorable  we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for the intended indications we are evaluating 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete carefully controlled and well designed clinical trials demonstrating that a particular drug is safe and effective for the applicable disease 
we cannot depend on data from prior trial results to predict or demonstrate that our drug products are safe and efficacious under regulatory guidelines to qualify for commercial sale 
we cannot assure you  nor can you rely on our previous clinical trial results to predict  that our ongoing or future clinical trials will yield favorable results 
adverse or inconclusive clinical results would prevent us from filing for regulatory approval of zadaxin for the indications that we are evaluating  and our current programs in those areas would fail 
in the past  alpha biomedical  from which we acquired certain rights to thymosin alpha  conducted a phase clinical trial of thymosin alpha as a therapy for hbv that did not produce statistically significant results and alpha biomedical did not submit a new drug application to the fda 
we are currently conducting phase clinical trials based on the use of zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon alpha for the treatment of hcv patients who did not previously respond to treatment 
we cannot assure you that these phase clinical trials will yield sufficient or adequate data to demonstrate appropriate safety and efficacy under fda guidelines 
any failure to obtain sufficient or adequate data could delay or prevent us from securing fda approval 
our two phase hcv clinical trials in the united states have been designed to show that the combination of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha adds a significant clinical benefit when compared to the use of pegylated interferon alpha alone in non 
table of contents responders 
we cannot assure you that the results of this combination therapy will yield the favorable results we expect  or that the independent use of pegylated interferon alpha will not perform better than anticipated  which could reduce the chances that a new drug application  or nda  will be approved 
if the combination therapy of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha causes significant adverse side effects beyond those caused by pegylated interferon alpha alone  our clinical trials could be delayed  patients may drop out at a greater than anticipated rate  we may be forced to halt the trials or the fda may reject an nda due to safety issues 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our efforts to market and sell zadaxin in the united states will be significantly impaired  our business will suffer and the price of our stock may decline 
our phase hbv clinical trial in japan was designed to demonstrate a clinical benefit measured by an analysis of a combination of safety and efficacy data points 
we cannot assure that the results of this study will warrant favorable consideration by the japanese ministry of health and welfare or result in a marketing registration of zadaxin 
if additional studies or other data are required for regulatory consideration  our efforts to market and sell zadaxin in japan will be significantly impaired  our business will suffer and the price of our stock may decline 
if we experience delays in patient enrollment in our clinical trials  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in accordance with our anticipated timeline 
each of our two current phase hcv clinical trials in the united states are designed to enroll patients  one trial treating patients with no liver damage and the other trial treating patients with mild cirrhosis of the liver 
the patient enrollment is complete in the first trial  however if we are unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in the second trial  if such enrollment is delayed or if patient drop out rates in either trial are higher than anticipated  our ability to proceed with our clinical trials and prepare an nda would be adversely affected 
in particular  we are experiencing competition for patients with mild cirrhosis of the liver  from trials sponsored by other commercial drug developers and from a trial sponsored by the national institutes of health 
competition for the enrollment of similar patients in other clinical trials or other delays in enrollment may prevent us from enrolling patients quickly enough to meet our current timing expectations for completing our phase trials  which would delay the preparation of an nda 
if we are not able to fully enroll patients for both of these clinical trials or patient drop out rates are higher than anticipated  it could reduce the chances that our nda will be approved 
we cannot predict the safety profile of the use of zadaxin when used in combination with other drugs 
many of our trials involve the use of zadaxin in combination with other drugs 
some of these drugs are known to cause adverse patient reactions 
even if zadaxin does not produce adverse side effects when used alone  we cannot predict how it will work with other drugs  including causing possible adverse side effects not directly attributable to the other drugs that could compromise the safety profile of zadaxin when used in certain combination therapies 
due to the outbreak of sars in china  sales of zadaxin in the second quarter of were significantly higher than expected and are not indicative of future sales 
our sales for the quarter ended june  were more than greater than sales for any quarter in our history as a result of a previously unanticipated increase in sales of zadaxin to hospitals in china 
this increase was related to the use of immune system enhancers  including zadaxin  in connection with the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
in future quarters  sales of zadaxin for the treatment of sars could be affected by changes in treatment in china  changes in the rate of infection and the emergence of evidence as to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of zadaxin or of other potential treatments for sars 
as a result of the containment of the sars epidemic  we expect sales in future quarters to be more consistent with sales patterns of the third and fourth quarters  both of which have significantly lower sales results than those of the second quarter in we could experience fluctuations in sales in future quarters as a result of similar factors 
our sales of zadaxin may fluctuate due to seasonality of product orders and sales in any quarter may not be indicative of future sales 
our sales for the quarter ended june  were greatly affected by the demand in china for zadaxin in connection with the treatment of sars 
it is not possible to predict at this time if sars will re emerge  like influenza  as a seasonal public health problem and what effect  if any  this would have on future sales of zadaxin 
to the extent that zadaxin is purchased in connection with future outbreaks of sars or other seasonal viral contagions  product sales could become more concentrated in certain quarters of the calendar year 
quarterly sales levels could fluctuate and sales in any quarter may not be indicative of sales in future periods 

table of contents our revenue is dependent on the sale of zadaxin in foreign countries  particularly china  and if we experience difficulties in our foreign sales efforts  our financial condition will be harmed 
our product revenue in the near term is highly dependent on the sale of zadaxin in foreign countries 
if we experience difficulties in our foreign sales efforts  our business will suffer and our financial condition will be harmed 
substantially all of our zadaxin sales are to customers in china 
sales of zadaxin in china may be limited due to the low average personal income  lack of patient cost reimbursement  poorly developed infrastructure and existing and potential competition from other products  including generics 
several local companies have introduced lower priced locally manufactured generic competitive products 
if these sales continue  there could be a negative impact on the price and the volume of zadaxin sold in china and this would harm our business 
in addition  our zadaxin sales and operations in other parts of asia  as well as in latin america and the middle east  are subject to a number of risks  including difficulties and delays in obtaining registrations  permits  pricing approvals and reimbursement and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
in addition  we experience other issues with managing foreign sales operations including long payment cycles  difficulties in accounts receivable collection and  especially from significant customers  fluctuations in the timing and amount of orders 
operations in foreign countries also expose us to risks relating to difficulties in enforcing our proprietary rights  currency fluctuations and adverse or deteriorating economic conditions 
we do not have product sales in the united states with which to offset any decrease in our revenue from zadaxin sales in asia  latin america and the middle east 
in addition  some countries in these regions  including china  regulate pharmaceutical prices and pharmaceutical importation 
these regulations may reduce prices for zadaxin to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market  limit the volume of product which may be imported and sold or place high import duties on the product  any of which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline 
because of china s tiered method of importing and distributing finished pharmaceutical products  our quarterly results may vary substantially from one period to the next 
china uses a tiered method to import and distribute finished pharmaceutical products 
at each port of entry  and prior to moving the product forward to the distributors  government licensed importing agents must process and evaluate each shipment to determine whether such shipment satisfies china s quality assurance requirements 
in order to efficiently manage this process  the importing agents typically place large  and therefore relatively few  orders within any six month period 
therefore  our sales to an importing agent can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the size and timing of the orders  which has in the past and may in the future cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
we rely on six importers to supply substantially all of our product in china 
because we use a small number of importing agents in china  our receivables from any one importing agent are material  and if we were unable to collect receivables from any importer  our business and cash flow would be adversely affected 
if we fail to protect our products  technologies and trade secrets  we may not be able to successfully use  manufacture  market or sell our products  or we may fail to advance or maintain our competitive position 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products and technologies and to preserve our trade secrets 
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the future 
our patents or patent applications may not have priority over others applications 
our existing patents and additional patents that may be issued  if any  may not provide a competitive advantage to us or may be invalidated or circumvented by our competitors 
others may independently develop similar products or design around patents issued or licensed to us 
patents issued to  or patent applications filed by  other companies could harm our ability to use  manufacture  market or sell our products or maintain our competitive position with respect to our products 
although many of our patents relating to zadaxin have expired  including composition of matter patents  we have rights to other patents and patent applications relating to zadaxin and zadaxin analogues  including method of use patents with respect to the use of zadaxin for certain indications 
if other parties develop generic forms of zadaxin for other indications  including conducting clinical trials for such indications  our patents and other rights might not be sufficient to prohibit them from marketing and selling such generic forms of zadaxin 
if other parties develop analogues or derivatives of zadaxin  our patents and other rights might not be sufficient to prohibit them from marketing these analogues or derivatives 
pharmaceutical products are either not patentable or have only recently become patentable in some of the countries in which we market or may market zadaxin 
past enforcement of intellectual property rights in many of these countries  including china in particular  has been limited or non existent 
future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable 
we are aware that other companies are marketing generic thymosin alpha in china  possibly in violation of our trademark or other rights  and we expect such violations of our rights to continue 
moreover  the issuance of a patent 
table of contents in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar patent in another country 
claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation  so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions 
if we are involved in intellectual property claims and litigation  the proceedings may divert our resources and subject us to significant liability for damages  substantial litigation expense and the loss of our proprietary rights 
our commercial success depends in part on us not infringing valid  enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties  and not breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of a third party patent that may relate to our products and may cover a method of action used by zadaxin 
we cannot assure you that our mechanism of action does not infringe on their claim 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential for up to months while pending in the patent and trademark office  and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
it is possible that we may unintentionally infringe these patents or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may in the future receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents 
any legal action against us or our collaborative partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products and processes affected by third party rights may require us or our collaborative partners to obtain licenses in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
our efforts to defend against any of these claims  regardless of merit  would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans 
in addition  these actions may subject us to potential liability for damages 
we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if other companies obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technology to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 
our efforts to defend against any of these claims would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans 
we may need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation results  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
these actions may subject us to potential liability for damages 
we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
we rely on third parties to supply our clinical trial and commercial products 
deficiencies in their work could delay or harm one or more important areas of our business including our sales  clinical trials or the regulatory approval process 
we rely on third parties  who are subject to regulatory oversight  to supply our clinical and commercial products 
typically we have at any time only one supplier for each phase of manufacturing of our product 
if unanticipated deficiencies in these suppliers occur  we could experience delays in our ability to assemble a timely and acceptable nda 
if sales of zadaxin were to increase dramatically  our third party suppliers may not be able to supply zadaxin quickly enough  which could limit our ability to satisfy increased demand or could adversely affect the ability of these suppliers to provide products for our clinical trials 
not all of the zadaxin planned to be used in our hcv clinical trials has been manufactured and received 
roche is our exclusive supplier of pegylated interferon alpha for our current us clinical trials  and we have not received all the pegylated interferon to be used in the clinical trials 
roche s agreement with us to provide our supply of pegylated interferon alpha can be terminated by them without cause on days notice  in which case we would need to purchase their product for use in the clinical trials 
any delay in receiving  or a recall of  pegylated interferon alpha or zadaxin  including by reason of roche s termination of its supply arrangement with us  could delay the clinical trials or detract from the integrity of the trial data 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our ability to complete our clinical trials in the united states and to market and sell zadaxin worldwide will be delayed or impaired  our business will suffer and the price of our stock may decline 
we have been in the process of qualifying a new manufacturer of zadaxin and if we encounter problems with this process of validation  our sales or our clinical trials could be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are not able to establish and maintain adequate manufacturing relationships  the development and sale of our products could be impaired 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities  in compliance with stringent regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
typically we have at any time only one supplier for each phase of manufacturing of our product 
manufacturing interruptions or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could significantly delay clinical development of potential products and reduce third party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed trials 
these interruptions or failures could also impede commercialization of our products  including sales of zadaxin in approved markets  and impair our competitive position 
any of these developments would harm our business 
we are in the process of changing suppliers for zadaxin and such changes require qualification of the new suppliers with regulatory agencies  quality assurance and other steps which could cause delays or interruptions of supply 
if we do not obtain the required regulatory approvals for a manufacturing change in a timely fashion  especially in china  our sales may be interrupted until the manufacturing change is approved 
although we are increasing inventories to prepare to manage any such occurrences  we may still experience interruptions in supply which could adversely affect our results 
in some countries  a manufacturing change may require additional regulatory approvals which may delay zadaxin marketing approvals in new markets 
in addition  manufacturing  supply and quality control problems may arise as we  either alone or with subcontractors  attempt to scale up our manufacturing procedures 
we may not be able to scale up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost  either of which could cause delays or pose a threat to the ultimate commercialization of our products and harm our business 
we may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize our products 
while we have limited sales of zadaxin in certain markets  we do not yet have regulatory approval for zadaxin for our principal target markets  and  in this respect  zadaxin is still being developed 
our other potential products are in earlier stages of development than zadaxin 
to fully develop our products  we will need to commit substantial resources to extensive research  development  pre clinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale 
we cannot assure that our efforts will produce commercially viable products 
we face significant technological risks inherent in developing these products 
we may also abandon some or all of our proposed products before they become commercially viable 
if any of our products  even if developed and approved  cannot be successfully commercialized in a timely manner  our business will be harmed and the price of our stock may decline 
we have not yet sold any product other than zadaxin and our sales have been primarily in a single country  china 
our future revenue growth depends on increased market acceptance and commercialization of zadaxin in additional countries  particularly in the united states  europe and japan 
if we fail to successfully market zadaxin  or if we cannot commercialize this drug in the united states and other additional markets  our revenue and operating results will suffer 
if unexpected and serious adverse events are reported  or if expected efficacy results are not achieved  it would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future revenue will also depend in part on our ability to develop other commercially viable and accepted products 
market acceptance of our products will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective customers to use our products as an alternative to other treatments and therapies and to convince prospective strategic partners to market our products effectively and to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost 
in addition  doctors must opt to use treatments involving our products 
if doctors elect to use a different course of treatment  demand for our drug products would be reduced 
failure to do any of the above will hurt our operations 
we rely on third party clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials and  as a result  we may encounter delays outside our control 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing clinical trials and we rely  in part  on third parties  particularly clinical research organizations and our development partners  to assist us in managing and monitoring clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties may result in delays in completing  or failure to complete  these clinical trials if third parties fail to fulfill their obligations to us 

table of contents we may need to obtain additional capital to support our long term product development and commercialization programs 
we believe our existing resources will be sufficient to complete our current us phase clinical trials and  if the trials are successful and we receive fda approval  to begin commercialization of zadaxin in the united states 
however  we cannot assure that such funds will be sufficient  or that sales of zadaxin  if approved in the united states  will result in profitable operations 
in addition  we may need additional funds in the future to support future growth and achieve profitability 
if we need to raise additional funds in the future and such funds are not available on reasonable terms  if at all  our commercialization efforts may be impeded  our revenues may be limited and our operating results may suffer 
we have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and may never achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we plan to dedicate substantially all of our resources to expanding our development  testing and marketing capabilities  particularly in the united states  and these losses may increase if we cannot increase or sustain revenue 
as a result  we may never achieve profitability 
we have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  which may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products 
we currently have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and we anticipate that we may be relying on third party collaborators to sell  market and distribute our products for the foreseeable future 
if our arrangements with these third parties are not successful  or if we are unable to enter into additional third party arrangements  we may need to substantially expand our sales  marketing and distribution force 
our efforts to expand may not succeed  or we may lack sufficient resources to expand in a timely manner  either of which will harm our operating results 
moreover  if we are able to further expand our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  we will begin competing with other companies that have experienced and well funded operations 
if we cannot successfully compete with these larger companies  our revenues may not grow and our business may suffer 
commercialization of some of our products depends on collaborations with others 
if our collaborators are not successful  or if we are unable to find future collaborators  we may not be able to properly develop and commercialize our products 
we depend in part on our distributors and business partners to develop and or promote our drugs  and if they are not successful in their efforts or fail to do so  our business will suffer 
for example  sigma tau is responsible for the development and marketing of zadaxin in europe 
we generally do not have control over the amount and timing of resources that our business partners devote to zadaxin  and they have not always performed as or when expected 
if they do not perform their obligations as we expect  particularly obligations regarding clinical trials  our development expenses would increase and the development and or sale of our products could be limited or delayed  which could hurt our business and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  our relationships with these companies may not be successful 
disputes may arise with our collaborators  including disputes over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate similar additional arrangements in the future to develop and commercialize zadaxin or other products 
we may lose market share or otherwise fail to compete effectively in the intensely competitive biopharmaceutical industry 
competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense  and we expect that competition will increase 
our success depends on our ability to compete in this industry  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors 
increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition resulting in lower prices and margins  which would hurt our operating results 
we are focused on developing zadaxin as a treatment for hcv and hbv and certain cancers 
several large biopharmaceutical companies have substantial commitments to interferon alpha  an approved drug for treating hbv and hcv  and to lamivudine and adefovir  approved drugs to treat hbv 
we cannot assure you that we will compete successfully against our competitors or that our competitors  or potential competitors  will not develop drugs or other treatments for hcv  hbv  cancer and other diseases that will be superior to ours 

table of contents if third party reimbursement is not available or patients cannot otherwise pay for zadaxin  we may not be able to successfully market zadaxin 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new therapeutic products  such as zadaxin 
we cannot assure you that third party insurance coverage and reimbursement will be available for therapeutic products we might develop 
the failure to obtain third party reimbursement for our products  particularly in the united states  europe and japan  would harm our business 
further  we cannot assure you that additional limitations will not be imposed in the future in the united states on drug coverage and reimbursement due to proposed health care reforms 
in many emerging markets where we have marketing rights to zadaxin  but where government resources and per capita income may be so low that our products will be prohibitively expensive  we may not be able to market our products on economically favorable terms  if at all 
efforts by governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce health care costs or the announcement of legislative proposals or reforms to implement government controls could cause us to reduce the prices at which we market our drugs  which will reduce our gross margins and may harm our business 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional  highly skilled personnel required for the expansion of our activities  our business will suffer 
we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the specialized  scientific and worldwide nature of our business 
there is intense competition for qualified management  scientific and technical personnel in the pharmaceutical industry  and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to grow and develop our business globally 
in addition  we assign numerous key responsibilities to a limited number of individuals  and we would experience difficulty in finding immediate replacements for any of them 
if we were unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed or promptly replace those employees who are critical to our product development and commercialization  the development and commercialization of our products would be adversely affected 
at this time  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  and our insurance may be inadequate to cover damages 
clinical trials or marketing of any of our current and potential products may expose us to liability claims from the use of these products 
we currently carry product liability insurance 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  for clinical and commercial activities or that the insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall 
if we fail to have sufficient coverage  our business  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we depend on international sales  and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results 
a large majority of our sales are in china 
heightened tensions resulting from the current geopolitical conditions in the middle east  north korea and elsewhere could worsen  causing disruptions in foreign trade  which would harm our sales 
in particular  our commercial product is manufactured in europe and distributed by us from our operations in hong kong 
any disruption of our supply and distribution activities due to geopolitical conditions could decrease our sales and harm our operating results 
if we are unable to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations  our business may be harmed 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  as well as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices and the experimental use of animals 
the extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action in these areas cannot be accurately predicted 
we do not currently maintain hazardous materials at our facilities 
while we outsource our research and development programs involving the controlled use of biohazardous materials  if in the future we conduct these programs ourselves  we might be required to incur significant cost to comply with the environmental laws and regulations 
further  in the event of an accident  we would be liable for any damages that result  and the liability could exceed our resources 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile  and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  substantial volatility due to many factors  some of which we have no control over  including results of clinical trials involving zadaxin  progress of zadaxin through the regulatory process  especially regulatory actions in the united states and japan  timing and achievement of milestones  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  government regulatory action affecting our drug products or our competitors drug products in both the united states and foreign countries  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  changes in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  general stock market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and biopharmaceutical market sectors  economic conditions in the united states or abroad  and broad financial market fluctuations in the united states  europe or asia 
in the past  following periods of large price declines in the public market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of our attention and resources  which would hurt our business 
any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
substantial sales of our stock or the exercise or conversion of options or convertible securities may impact the market price of our common stock 
as of december   stock options to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding  of which options to purchase  shares were exercisable 
also outstanding as of the same date were warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock at per share and for  shares at per share and two notes convertible into a total of  shares of common stock 
the note holder has the right to purchase up to million of additional convertible notes due on or before march  which  if fully issued  will be convertible into  shares of our common stock 
upon exercise of options or warrants  or conversion of the notes  these issued shares of common stock will be freely tradable 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
similarly  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall 
sales of our common stock by officers and directors could affect our stock price 
our board of directors has approved an amendment to our trading policy that permits officers and directors to enter into trading plans that comply with the requirements of rule b of the securities and exchange act of rule b allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written  pre arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material  non public information 
using these plans  officers and directors can gradually diversify their investment portfolios  can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce any market impact and can avoid concerns about initiating stock transactions at a time when they might be in possession of material  non public information 
as of march  only one director has adopted such a plan  with sales commencing no earlier than may  and other directors or officers may do so in the future 
in general our officers and directors 
table of contents have rarely sold stock in the company  though they have held options or stock for many years 
we expect future sales by officers and directors either under b plans or otherwise as result of personal financial planning 
we do not believe the volume of such sales would affect our trading price  however  the market could react negatively to sales by our officers and directors  affecting the trading price of our stock 
if our officers  directors and largest stockholders elect to act together  they may be able to control our management and operations  acting in their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
as of december  our directors and officers owned or had the right to acquire approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
our two largest stockholders  sigma tau and its affiliates and randal j 
kirk  owned in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of our capital stock 
as a result  due to their concentration of stock ownership  our directors  officers and largest stockholders  if they act together  may be able to influence our management and operation and may be able to affect or influence all matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of all directors and the amendment of charter documents or the approval of a merger  sale of assets or other major corporate transactions 
although they are independent of each other and not part of a group  in we obtained the support of sigma tau and mr 
kirk for our proposal to the stockholders to reincorporate in delaware  and without that support we would not have been able to obtain the required stockholder approval for that matter 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
prior to our recent reincorporation in delaware  we had a stockholder rights plan  also commonly known as a poison pill  which we terminated in connection with the reincorporation 
we currently do not intend to adopt a stockholder rights plan 
however  our charter documents do contain certain anti takeover provisions  including provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders may not cumulate votes  stockholders meetings may be called by stockholders only if they hold or more of our common stock and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent 
additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue million shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by the stockholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
we may be subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
substantially all of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuation in the us dollar exchange rate with local currency directly affects the customer s cost for our product 
in particular  a stronger us dollar vis vis the local currency would tend to have an adverse effect on sales and potentially on collection of accounts receivable 
to date  this exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal because the chinese currency has been pegged to the us dollar 
however  the fixed nature of the chinese currency in relation to the us dollar may not continue in the future and  consequently  our foreign operations may expose us to greater risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
in addition  we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of expenses incurred by our foreign operations 
in particular  one of our supply arrangements under which we purchase finished products is denominated in euros 
consequently  changes in exchange rates could unpredictably and adversely affect our operating results and could result in exchange losses 
to date  we have not hedged against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and  therefore  exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest solely in us treasury or us government agency notes 
our investments in these notes are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term notes and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value of our available for sale securities 
this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
substantially all our sales and most of our manufacturing costs to date have been in us dollars 
our purchases from one of our contract manufacturers are denominated in euros and this exposes us to foreign currency rate fluctuations
