item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
regulation g disclosure the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity set forth in this item have been derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in addition to the gaap results of operations  the company has also provided additional information concerning the company s results that includes certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap financial measures included in this discussion are adjusted net income  gross profit and earnings per share amounts that exclude i the pre tax charges of million associated with the integration of the top flite golf business  ii the pre tax adjustment of million to reduce the company s warranty reserve and iii the pre tax non cash energy derivative charge of million 
this discussion also includes results of the callaway golf brand operations on a stand alone basis  although such operations are not a reportable business segment 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies 
management believes that the presentation of such non gaap financial measures  when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures  provides useful information to investors by permitting additional relevant period to period comparisons of the historical operations of the callaway golf business excluding the operations of the recently acquired top flite golf business  as well as information concerning operations excluding the effect of significant unusual non cash charges such as the top flite integration charges  the warranty reserve adjustment and the energy derivative charge 
the company has included in this discussion supplemental information which reconciles those non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
if the actual costs of sales returns and sales programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be significantly adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value 
table of contents of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment  and global economy  could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of  or idle certain of its long lived assets 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  following the top flite acquisition  the company began consolidating the callaway golf and top flite golf ball and golf club manufacturing and research and development operations 
in connection with this consolidation  the company disposed of certain of its long lived assets 
as a result  the company reduced the carrying value of its golf ball assets and therefore incurred pre tax charges to earnings in the amount of million  which were primarily non cash 
see below top flite acquisition 
during the third quarter of  the company evaluated and determined that the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be derived from its golf ball assets  including the acquired top flite golf ball assets  exceeded the carrying value of such assets and therefore no impairment existed 
as noted above  during the fourth quarter of  the company disposed of certain of its long lived assets which reduced the carrying value of its golf ball assets 
at that time the company determined that no impairment existed 
if the company were to change the manner in which it conducts its golf ball business or otherwise lower its estimates of the undiscounted cash flows it expects to derive from its golf ball assets  the company could be required to assess impairment again 
warranty the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its callaway golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
change in accounting estimate as discussed above  the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its callaway golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
prior to the third quarter of  the company s method of estimating both its implicit and explicit warranty obligation was to utilize data and information based on the cumulative failure rate by product after taking into consideration specific risks the company believes existed at the time the financial statements were prepared 
these additional risks included product specific risks  such as the introduction of products with new technology or materials that would be more susceptible to failure or breakage  and other business risks  
table of contents such as increased warranty liability as a result of acquisitions 
in many cases  additions to the warranty reserve for new product introductions have been based on management s judgment of possible future claims derived from the limited product failure data that was available at the time 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company began to compile data that illustrated the timing of warranty claims in relation to product life cycles 
in the third quarter of  the company determined it had gathered sufficient data and concluded it should enhance its warranty accrual estimation methodology to utilize the additional data 
the analysis of the data  in management s judgment  provided management with more insight into timing of claims and demonstrated that some product failures are more likely to occur early in a product s life cycle while other product failures occur in a more linear fashion over the product s life cycle 
as a result of its analysis of the recently collected additional information  the company believes it has gained better insight and improved judgment to more accurately project the ultimate failure rates of its products 
as a result of this refinement in its methodology  the company concluded that it should change its methodology of estimating warranty accruals and reduce its warranty reserve by approximately million 
the million reduction is recorded in cost of sales and favorably impacted gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points for the year ended december  the change in methodology has been accounted for as a change in accounting principle inseparable from a change in estimate 
the following summarizes what net income and earnings per share would have been had the warranty reserve adjustment  adjusted for taxes  been excluded from reported results year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax pro forma net income basic earnings per share reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax pro forma basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax pro forma diluted earnings per share recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which note is incorporated herein by this reference 
top flite acquisition during the latter part of  the company completed the acquisition through a court approved sale of substantially all of the golf related assets of tfgc estate inc f k a the top flite golf company  f k a spalding sports worldwide  inc  which included golf ball manufacturing facilities  the top flite  strata and ben hogan brands  and all golf related patents and trademarks 
the company acquired the top flite assets because they provided a unique opportunity to increase significantly the size and profitability of the company s golf ball business and the company was able to purchase the acquired assets at less than their estimated fair 
table of contents value 
the company intends to continue the us and foreign operations of the acquired golf assets  including the use of acquired assets in the manufacture of golf balls and golf clubs and the commercialization of existing top flite  strata and ben hogan brands  patents and trademarks 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
under sfas no 
 the estimated aggregate cost of the acquired assets is million  which includes cash paid million  transaction costs approximately million  and assumed liabilities approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the assets exceeded the estimated aggregate acquisition costs 
as a result  the company was required to reduce the carrying value of the acquired long term assets on a pro rata basis 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  a final determination of the allocation of the aggregate acquisition costs will be made upon a final assessment of the estimated fair value of the acquired net assets 
it is anticipated that the final assessment will be completed during the second quarter of and that the final allocation will not differ materially from the preliminary allocation 
the preliminary allocation is as follows in millions assets acquired accounts receivable inventory other assets property and equipment intangible assets liabilities assumed current liabilities long term liabilities total net assets acquired during the fourth quarter of  the company began consolidating the callaway golf and top flite golf ball and golf club manufacturing and research and development operations 
in connection with this consolidation  the company disposed of certain of its golf ball manufacturing assets and therefore incurred non cash charges to earnings in the amount of million 
on january   the company announced that in it expects to incur additional charges of approximately million as it continues to consolidate its operations 
these additional charges are expected to include non cash charges for the disposal of additional assets and cash charges for severance and facility consolidations 
the company s results of operations include the top flite golf company results beginning september  results of operations years ended december  and net sales increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the overall increase in net sales is primarily due to a million increase in the sales of putters  a million increase in the sales of irons  a million increase in the sales of golf balls and a million increase in the sales of accessories and other products as compared to the increase in golf ball sales is attributable to the addition of top flite golf ball sales 
the aggregate increases in net sales were partially offset by a million decrease in sales of woods in as compared to in addition  as compared to  the company s reported net sales were significantly affected by the translation of foreign currency sales into us dollars based upon exchange rates 
if exchange rates were applied to reported net sales and all other factors were held constant  net sales would have been million less than reported

at december   the company had a revolving line of credit with bank of america and certain other lenders to borrow up to million the credit facility 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with the covenants prescribed by that facility 
as expected  during the first quarter of the company began using its line of credit 
also during the first quarter of  as a result of the recent top flite acquisition and normal seasonality of the company s business  the company obtained a commitment subject to customary loan documentation and closing conditions for an additional million unsecured line of credit with bank of america 
the purpose of this commitment is to ensure an additional source of liquidity during the first part of the new golf season during which the company typically uses more cash than it generates 
during the second quarter  the company typically begins generating cash in excess of its cash needs 
the company expects that all amounts borrowed under its credit facilities will be paid off by the end of the second quarter and that the company will thereafter continue to generate cash for the balance of the year

table of contents the company acquired certain capital lease obligations as a result of the top flite acquisition primarily related to computer and telecommunications systems 
the amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable capital leases 
occasionally the company enters into long term purchase commitments for production materials and other items  however  at december   the company had no such outstanding commitments 
the company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or are undocumented except for an invoice 
such obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item 
the amounts presented in this line item represent the liability for the company s unfunded  non qualified deferred compensation plan 
the plan allows officers  certain other employees and directors of the company to defer all or part of their compensation  to be paid to the participants or their designated beneficiaries after retirement  death or separation from the company 
to support the deferred compensation plan  the company has elected to purchase company owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of the company owned insurance related to deferred compensation is included in other assets and was million at december  during the third quarter of  the company entered into a derivative commodity instrument to manage electricity costs in the volatile california energy market 
the contract was originally effective through may during the fourth quarter of  the company notified the energy supplier that  among other things  the energy supplier was in default of the energy supply contract and that based upon such default  and for other reasons  the company was terminating the energy supply contract 
the company continues to reflect the million derivative valuation account on its balance sheet  subject to periodic review  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the million represents unrealized losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the contract and does not represent contractual cash obligations 
the company believes the energy supply contract has been terminated and  therefore  the company does not have any further cash obligations under the contract 
accordingly  the energy derivative valuation account is not included in the table 
there can be no assurance  however  that a party will not assert a future claim against the company or that a bankruptcy court or arbitrator will not ultimately nullify the company s termination of the contract 
no provision has been made for contingencies or obligations  if any  under the contract beyond november see below supply of electricity and energy contracts 
in addition to the obligations listed above  the company has entered into contracts with professional golfers to evaluate and promote callaway golf  odyssey  top flite  ben hogan and strata branded products 
many of these contracts provide incentives for successful performances using the company s products 
for example  under these contracts  the company could be obligated to pay a cash bonus to a professional who wins a particular tournament while playing the company s golf clubs or golf balls 
it is not possible to predict with any certainty the amount of such performance awards the company will be required to pay in any given year 
such expenses  however  are an ordinary part of the company s business and the company does not believe that the payment of these performance awards will have a material adverse effect upon the company 
see below certain factors affecting callaway golf company golf professional endorsements 
during its normal course of business  the company has made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include i intellectual property indemnities to the company s customers and licensees in connection with the use  sale and or license of company products or trademarks  ii indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases  iii indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the company and iv indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts

the company has also issued a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent 
table of contents liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the company could be obligated to make 
historically  costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under the commitments and guarantees described above 
the fair value of indemnities  commitments and guarantees that the company issued during the fiscal year ended december  was not material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed above  the company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the company is subject to from time to time 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
sufficiency of liquidity based upon its current operating plan  analysis of its consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  the company believes that its operating cash flows  together with its credit facilities  will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  planned capital expenditures  contractual obligations and commercial commitments  for the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that future industry specific or other developments  general economic trends or other matters will not adversely affect the company s operations or its ability to meet its future cash requirements see below certain factors affecting callaway golf company 
supply of electricity and energy contracts beginning in the summer of  the company identified a future risk to ongoing operations as a result of the deregulation of the electricity market in california 
in july  the company entered into a one year supply agreement with idaho power company idaho power  a subsidiary of idacorp  inc  for the supply of electricity at per megawatt hour 
during the second quarter of  idaho power advised the company that it was unwilling to renew the contract upon expiration in july due to concerns surrounding the volatility of the california electricity market at that time 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the company entered into an agreement with pilot power group  inc pilot power as the company s energy service provider and in connection therewith entered into a long term  fixed priced  fixed capacity  energy supply contract enron contract with enron energy services  inc eesi  a subsidiary of enron corporation  as part of a comprehensive strategy to ensure the uninterrupted supply of electricity while capping costs in the volatile california electricity market 
the enron contract provided  subject to the other terms and conditions of the contract  for the company to purchase nine megawatts of energy per hour from june  through may   megawatts over the term of the contract 
the total purchase price for such energy over the full contract term would have been approximately million 
at the time the company entered into the enron contract  nine megawatts per hour was in excess of the amount the company expected to be able to use in its operations 
the company agreed to purchase this amount  however  in order to obtain a more favorable price than the company could have obtained if the company had purchased a lesser quantity 
the company expected to be able to sell any excess supply through pilot power 
because the enron contract provided for the company to purchase an amount of energy in excess of what it expected to be able to use in its operations  the company accounted for the enron contract as a derivative instrument in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the enron contract did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
therefore  the company recognized changes in the estimated fair value of the enron contract currently in earnings 
the estimated fair value of the enron contract was based upon a present value determination of the net differential between the contract price for electricity and the estimated future market prices for electricity 
table of contents as applied to the remaining amount of unpurchased electricity under the enron contract 
through september   the company had recorded unrealized pre tax losses of million 
on november   the company notified eesi that  among other things  eesi was in default of the enron contract and that based upon such default  and for other reasons  the company was terminating the enron contract effective immediately 
at the time of termination  the contract price for the remaining energy to be purchased under the enron contract through may was approximately million 
on november   eesi notified the company that it disagreed that it was in default of the enron contract and that it was prepared to deliver energy pursuant to the enron contract 
however  on december   eesi  along with enron corporation and numerous other related entities  filed for bankruptcy 
since november   the parties have not been operating under the enron contract and pilot power has been providing energy to the company from alternate suppliers 
as a result of the company s notice of termination to eesi  and certain other automatic termination provisions under the enron contract  the company believes that the enron contract has been terminated 
as a result  the company adjusted the estimated value of the enron contract through the date of termination  at which time the terminated enron contract ceased to represent a derivative instrument in accordance with sfas no 
because the enron contract is terminated and neither party to the contract is performing pursuant to the terms of the contract  the company no longer records future valuation adjustments for changes in electricity rates 
the company continues to reflect on its balance sheet the derivative valuation account of million  subject to periodic review  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the company believes the enron contract has been terminated  and as of march   eesi has not asserted any claim against the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that eesi or another party will not assert a future claim against the company or that a bankruptcy court or arbitrator will not ultimately nullify the company s termination of the enron contract 
no provision has been made for contingencies or obligations  if any  under the enron contract beyond november  certain factors affecting callaway golf company the financial statements contained in this report and the related discussion describe and analyze the company s financial performance and condition for the periods indicated

these forward looking statements are based upon current information and expectations and actual results could differ materially 
the company therefore has included the following discussion of certain factors that could cause the company s future performance or financial condition to differ materially from its prior performance or financial condition or from management s expectations or estimates of the company s future performance or financial condition 
these factors  among others  should be considered in assessing the company s future prospects and prior to making an investment decision with respect to the company s stock 
top flite golf company asset acquisition in september  the company acquired through a court approved sale substantially all of the golf related assets of the tfgc estate inc f k a the top flite golf company  f k a spalding sports worldwide  inc  which included golf ball manufacturing facilities  the top flite  strata and ben hogan brands  and all golf related patents and trademarks 
the company faces certain challenges associated with this acquisition  including i reinvigorating the top flite brand in the marketplace  ii the assimilation of the top flite and callaway golf brands in the marketplace without negatively affecting the sales of either brand  iii the integration and consolidation of the callaway golf and top flite golf ball manufacturing operations and the integration of the international top flite sales and distribution operations with the company s existing foreign subsidiaries  iv operating all or almost all of the golf ball manufacturing operations in a mature facility that is located in a harsh climate across the country from the company s 
table of contents principal executive offices and that has a unionized workforce  and v the employee and other issues inherent in any consolidation 
furthermore  the integration and consolidation of the acquired assets will require a considerable amount of time and attention of senior management and others  which could have an adverse effect upon the company s club business 
in addition  in connection with the integration and consolidation of the golf ball manufacturing operations  the company has incurred and expects to incur additional  significant charges to earnings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge for million related to the disposal of certain golf ball manufacturing equipment 
on january   the company announced that in it expects to incur additional charges of approximately million as it continues to consolidate its operations 
finally  the company has spent a considerable amount of cash to acquire the top flite golf company assets and there is no assurance that the company will realize a satisfactory return on its investment 
terrorist activity and armed conflict terrorist activities and armed conflicts in recent years such as the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon  the incidents of anthrax poisoning and the military actions in the middle east  including the war in iraq  as well as the threat of future conflict  have had a significant adverse effect upon the company s business 
any such additional events would likely have an adverse effect upon the world economy and would likely adversely affect the level of demand for the company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on these events and the economic  political  and public safety issues and concerns associated with such events 
also  such events could adversely affect the company s ability to manage its supply and delivery logistics 
if such events caused a significant disruption in domestic or international air  ground or sea shipments  the company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to produce and sell its products and to deliver customer orders also would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  such events have negatively impacted tourism 
if this negative impact upon tourism continues  the company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations would be materially adversely affected 
pandemic diseases the outbreak of a pandemic disease  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the avian flu  could significantly adversely affect the company s business 
a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the company s products 
demand for golf products could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines 
moreover  the company relies on many companies in asia for its components 
if the company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a pandemic disease  the company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected 
in addition  the outbreak of any such disease generally restricts the travel to and from such countries making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations 
adverse global economic conditions the company sells golf clubs  golf balls and golf accessories 
these products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers 
consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous 
adverse economic conditions in the united states or in the company s international markets which represent almost half of the company s total sales  or a decrease in prosperity among consumers  or even a decrease in consumer confidence as a result of anticipated adverse economic conditions  could cause consumers to forgo or to postpone purchasing new golf products 
such forgone or postponed purchases could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the company believes that the current economic conditions in many of the countries where the company conducts business  although beginning to show signs of improvement  generally remain unfavorable to the golf industry 
many people in the united states have lost a substantial amount of wealth in the stock 
table of contents market  including some who have lost all or substantially all of their retirement savings 
furthermore  in the united states  there have been announcements by companies of significant reductions in force  and others are possible  and consumers are less likely to purchase new golf equipment when they are unemployed 
the company believes that these adverse conditions have adversely affected the company s sales and will continue to do so until such conditions improve 
foreign currency risk almost half of the company s sales are international sales 
as a result  the company conducts transactions in approximately currencies worldwide 
conducting business in such various currencies increases the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect the company s financial results 
overall  the company is generally negatively affected by a stronger us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts business 
conversely  overall  the company is generally positively affected by a weaker us dollar relative to such foreign currencies 
for the effect of foreign currencies on the company s financial results for the current reporting periods  see above results of operations 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can be significant 
the company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations over time on the company s financial results 
the company s hedging activities reduce  but do not eliminate  the effects of such foreign currency fluctuations 
factors that could affect the effectiveness of the company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility  they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar 
for the effect of the company s hedging activities during the current reporting periods  see below quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s future financial results could be significantly negatively affected if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts business 
the degree to which the company s financial results are affected will depend in part upon the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the company s hedging activities 
growth opportunities golf clubs 
in order for the company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs  the company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or the market for golf clubs must grow 
the company already has a significant share of the worldwide premium golf club market and therefore opportunities for additional market share may be limited 
the company does not believe there has been any material increase in the number of golfers in the united states in over four years 
golf datatech has reported that during the number of golf rounds played in the united states declined  as compared to the same period in  and that rounds played have decreased each year since at least furthermore  the company believes that since the overall worldwide premium golf club market has generally not experienced substantial growth in dollar volume from year to year 
there is no assurance that the overall dollar volume of the worldwide premium golf club market will grow  or that it will not decline  in the future 
golf balls 
in connection with the acquisition of the top flite assets  the company anticipates that it will significantly increase its golf ball market share 
prior to the acquisition  however  both callaway golf s and top flite s market shares had been declining 
the company s ability to reverse such decline and obtain the market share previously enjoyed by the top flite golf company will depend in part upon the company s ability to integrate the top flite brands and operations with the callaway golf brands and operations 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully or profitably integrate these brands or operations or maintain the combined market share previously enjoyed by the top flite golf company and callaway golf company 

table of contents golf ball costs the cost of entering the golf ball business has been significant 
the cost of competing in the golf ball business has also been significant and has required significant investment in advertising  tour and promotion 
the development of the callaway golf company golf ball business has had a significant negative impact on the company s cash flows  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the company spent approximately million in cash to acquire substantially all of the golf related assets of tfgc estate inc f k a the top flite golf company  f k a spalding sports worldwide  inc 
as presently structured  the company will need to produce and sell golf balls in large volumes to cover its costs and be profitable 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the sales volume necessary to make its golf ball business profitable 
until the golf ball business becomes profitable  the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position will continue to be negatively affected 
manufacturing capacity the company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products 
actual demand for such products may exceed or be less than forecasted demand 
the company s unique product designs often require sophisticated manufacturing techniques  which can require significant start up expenses and or limit the company s ability to quickly expand its manufacturing capacity to meet the full demand for its products 
if the company is unable to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand  especially during the company s traditionally busy season  it could limit the company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance 
on the other hand  the company invests in manufacturing capacity and commits to components and other manufacturing inputs for varying periods of time  which can limit the company s ability to quickly react if actual demand is less than forecasted demand 
this could result in less than optimum capacity usage and or in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
in addition  if the company were to experience delays  difficulties or increased costs in its production of golf clubs or golf balls  including production of new products needed to replace current products  the company s future golf club or golf ball sales could be adversely affected 
dependence on energy resources the company s golf club and golf ball manufacturing facilities use  among other resources  significant quantities of electricity to operate 
in  some companies in california  including the company  experienced periods of blackouts during which electricity was not available 
the company has taken certain steps to provide access to alternative power supplies for certain of its operations  and believes that these measures could mitigate any impact resulting from possible future blackouts 
the company is currently purchasing wholesale energy through the company s energy service provider under short term contracts 
from time to time  legislation has been introduced that would restrict the company s ability to purchase wholesale energy through its energy service provider 
if any such legislation were passed  the company may be required to purchase energy from the local public utility  which could cause the company s cost of energy to increase 
if the company s costs of energy were to increase as a result of such legislation or otherwise  the company s results of operations would be adversely affected 
dependence on certain suppliers and materials the company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts  some of which are single sourced 
in addition  some of the company s products require specifically developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly 
the company believes that suitable clubheads and shafts could be obtained from other manufacturers in the event its regular suppliers because of financial difficulties or otherwise are unable or fail to provide suitable components 
however  there could be a significant production delay or disruption caused by the inability of current suppliers to deliver or the transition to other suppliers  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company is also single sourced or dependent on a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls 
many of the materials are customized for 
table of contents the company 
any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the company s golf ball business 
if the company did experience any such delays or interruptions  there is no assurance that the company would be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business 
the company uses united parcel service ups for substantially all ground shipments of products to its us customers 
the company uses air carriers and ships for most of its international shipments of products 
any significant interruption in ups  air carrier or ship services could have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to deliver its products to its customers 
if there were any significant interruption in such services  there is no assurance that the company could engage alternative suppliers to deliver its products in a timely and cost efficient manner 
in addition  many of the components the company uses to build its golf clubs  including clubheads and shafts  are shipped to the company via air carrier and ship services 
any significant interruption in ups services  air carrier services or shipping services into or out of the united states could have a material adverse effect upon the company see also below international risks 
the company s size has made it a large consumer of certain materials  including titanium alloys and carbon fiber 
the company does not make these materials itself  and must rely on its ability to obtain adequate supplies in the world marketplace in competition with other users of such materials 
while the company has been successful in obtaining its requirements for such materials thus far  there can be no assurance that it always will be able to do so 
an interruption in the supply of the materials used by the company or a significant change in costs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition golf clubs 
the worldwide market for premium golf clubs is highly competitive  and is served by a number of well established and well financed companies with recognized brand names  as well as new companies with popular products 
new product introductions  price reductions  consignment sales  extended payment terms and close outs including close outs of products that were recently commercially successful by competitors continue to generate increased market competition 
while the company believes that its products and its marketing efforts continue to be competitive  there can be no assurance that successful marketing activities  discounted pricing  consignment sales  extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors will not negatively impact the company s future sales 
golf balls 
the premium golf ball business is also highly competitive and may be becoming even more competitive 
there are a number of well established and well financed competitors  including one competitor with an estimated market share in excess of 
furthermore  worldwide sales of golf balls have been declining due to declines in the number of golf rounds played and other factors  resulting in a surplus of worldwide golf ball manufacturing capacity 
as competition in this business increases  many of these competitors are substantially discounting the prices of their products and or increasing advertising  tour or other promotional support 
this increased competition has resulted in significant expenses in both tour and advertising support and product development 
in order for its golf ball business to be successful  the company will need to integrate the acquired top flite assets with its golf ball manufacturing operations and must produce golf balls at prices and costs that are reasonable and must sell a sufficient amount of golf balls of both brands in excess of such costs to be profitable 
on a consolidated basis  no one customer that distributes golf clubs or balls in the united states accounted for more than of the company s revenues in  or on a segment basis  the golf ball customer base is much more concentrated than the golf club customer base 
in  it is expected that the top five golf ball customers will account for over of the total golf ball sales 
a loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s golf ball sales 

table of contents market acceptance of products a golf manufacturer s ability to compete is in part dependent upon its ability to satisfy the various subjective requirements of golfers  including a golf club s and golf ball s look and feel  and the level of acceptance that a golf club and ball has among professional and recreational golfers 
the subjective preferences of golf club and ball purchasers are difficult to predict and may be subject to rapid and unanticipated changes 
in addition  the company s products have tended to incorporate significant innovations in design and manufacture  which have often resulted in higher prices for the company s products relative to other products in the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that a significant percentage of the public will always be willing to pay such premium prices for golf equipment or that the company will be able to continue to design and manufacture premium products that achieve market acceptance in the future 
for example  in  the company introduced the big bertha c driver made of compression cured carbon composite 
despite the product s excellent performance  this product did not meet the company s sales expectations and is indicative of the risks associated with the subjective preferences of golfers 
in general  there can be no assurance as to how long the company s golf clubs and golf balls will maintain market acceptance and therefore no assurance that the demand for the company s products will permit the company to experience growth in sales  or maintain historical levels of sales  in the future 
new product introduction and product cyclicality the company believes that the introduction of new  innovative golf clubs and golf balls is important to its future success 
a major portion of the company s revenues is generated by products that are less than two years old 
the company faces certain risks associated with such a strategy 
for example  in the golf industry  new models and basic design changes in golf equipment are frequently met with consumer rejection 
in addition  prior successful designs may be rendered obsolete within a relatively short period of time as new products are introduced into the marketplace 
further  any new products that retail at a lower price than prior products may negatively impact the company s revenues unless unit sales increase 
the rapid introduction of new golf club or golf ball products by the company could result in close outs of existing inventories at both the wholesale and retail levels 
such close outs can result in reduced margins on the sale of older products  as well as reduced sales of new products  given the availability of older products at lower prices 
the company s newly introduced golf club products generally have a product life cycle of approximately two years 
these products generally sell significantly better in the first year after introduction as compared to the second year 
in certain markets  such as japan  the decline in sales during the second year is even more significant 
the company s titanium metal wood products generally sell at higher price points than its comparable steel metal wood products 
historically  the company s wood products generally have achieved better gross margins than its comparable iron products 
the company s sales and gross margins for a particular period may be negatively or positively affected by the mix of new products sold in such period 
seasonality and adverse weather conditions in addition to the effects of product cycles described above  the company s business is also subject to the effects of seasonal fluctuations 
the company s first quarter sales generally represent the company s sell in to the golf retail channel of its products for the new golf season 
orders for many of these sales are received during the fourth quarter of the prior year 
the company s second and third quarter sales generally represent re order business 
sales during the second and third quarters therefore are significantly affected not only by the sell through of the company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell through of the products of the company s competitors 
retailers are sometimes reluctant to re order the company s products in significant quantity when they already have excess inventory of the company s competitors products 
the company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than the other quarters because in general in the company s principal markets less people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather 
furthermore  it previously was the company s practice to announce its new product line at the beginning of each calendar year 
the company has departed from that practice and now generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan better 
such early announcements of new products could cause golfers  and therefore the company s customers  to defer 
table of contents purchasing additional golf equipment until the company s new products are available 
such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the company s current products and or result in close out sales at reduced prices 
because of these seasonal trends  the company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions 
unfavorable weather conditions generally result in less golf rounds played  which generally results in less demand for golf clubs and golf balls 
consequently  sustained adverse weather conditions  especially during the warm weather months  could materially affect the company s sales 
conformance with the rules of golf new golf club and golf ball products generally seek to satisfy the standards established by the usga and r a because these standards are generally followed by golfers within their respective jurisdictions 
the usga rules are generally followed in the united states  canada and mexico  and the r a rules are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world 
the rules of golf as published by the r a and the usga are virtually the same except with respect to the regulation of driving clubs 
all of the company s current products including the new erc fusion and great big bertha ii drivers  with the exception of the erc fusion and great big bertha ii drivers  are believed to be conforming under the rules of golf as published by the usga 
all of the company s current products are believed to be conforming to the existing rules of golf as published by the r a 
however  effective january  the company s erc fusion and great big bertha ii titanium drivers are not conforming in certain competitions involving highly skilled golfers and effective january  such drivers will not be conforming under the generally applicable rules of golf as published by the r a 
these new r a restrictions could affect current and future sales of such drivers in r a jurisdictions  including jurisdictions in which the company previously sold such products and in which there previously were no r a restrictions 
the company also believes that the general confusion created by the usga as to what is a conforming or non conforming driver has hurt sales of its drivers generally 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company s future products will satisfy usga and or r a standards  or that existing usga and or r a standards will not be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the company s products or the company s brand 
for example  both the usga and the r a are considering rules which would limit clubhead volume 
if any such volume limitation rules were adopted and caused one or more of the company s current products to be non conforming  the company s sales of such products could be adversely affected 
furthermore  such clubhead volume limitations would restrict the company s ability to develop new golf club products 
golf professional endorsements the company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote callaway golf  odyssey  top flite and ben hogan branded products 
the company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours  including the champions tour  the pga tour  the lpga tour  the pga european tour  the japan golf tour and the nationwide tour 
while most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations  some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments 
if certain of the company s professional endorsers were to stop using the company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements  the company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity 
golf clubs 
in the past  the company has experienced an exceptional level of club usage on the world s major professional tours  and the company has heavily advertised that fact 
many professional golfers throughout the world use the company s golf clubs even though they are not contractually bound to do so and do not grant any endorsement to the company 
the company from time to time implements programs that create cash incentives that financially reward such usage 
many other companies  however  also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements  including significant cash rewards and specially designed products 
the inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the company s clubs by professional golfers or increase the amount the company must spend to maintain 
table of contents its tour presence 
the company believes that professional usage contributes to retail sales  and it is therefore possible that a decline in the level of professional usage of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and business 
golf balls 
many golf ball manufacturers  including the leading us manufacturer of premium golf balls  have focused a great deal of their marketing efforts on promoting the fact that tour professionals use their balls 
some of these golf ball competitors spend large amounts of money to secure professional endorsements and or usage  and the market leader has obtained a very high degree of tour penetration 
while all of the company s staff professionals  as well as other professionals who are not on the company s staff  have decided to use the company s golf balls in play  there is no assurance they will continue to do so 
furthermore  there are many other professionals who are already under contract with other golf ball manufacturers or who  for other reasons  may not choose to play the company s golf ball products 
the company does not currently plan to match the endorsement spending levels of the leading manufacturer  and will instead rely more heavily upon the performance of the company s golf ball products and other factors to attract professionals to the product 
there is some evidence to suggest that there is a correlation between use by professional golfers and retail sales 
the company therefore believes that the results of the company s golf ball business could be significantly affected by its success or lack of success in securing acceptance on the professional tours 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the golf club industry  in general  has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs 
the company has an active program of enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knock off products  and asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights  patents  trademarks  and trade dress 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will reduce the level of acceptance obtained by these infringers 
additionally  there can be no assurance that other golf club manufacturers will not be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the company s designs without infringing any of the company s copyrights  patents  trademarks  or trade dress 
an increasing number of the company s competitors have  like the company itself  sought to obtain patent  trademark  copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls 
as the company develops new products  it attempts to avoid infringing the valid patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
before introducing new products  the company s legal staff evaluates the patents and other intellectual property rights of others to determine if changes are required to avoid infringing any valid intellectual property rights that could be asserted against the company s new product offerings 
from time to time  others have contacted or may contact the company to claim that they have proprietary rights that have been infringed by the company and or its products 
the company evaluates any such claims and  where appropriate  has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements 
to date  there have been no interruptions in the company s business as a result of any claims of infringement 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will not be adversely affected in the future by the assertion of intellectual property rights belonging to others 
this effect could include alteration or withdrawal of existing products and delayed introduction of new products 
various patents have been issued to the company s competitors in the golf ball industry 
as the company develops its golf ball products  it attempts to avoid infringing valid patents or other intellectual property rights 
despite these attempts  it cannot be guaranteed that competitors will not assert and or a court will not find that the company s golf balls infringe certain patent or other rights of competitors 
if the company s golf balls are found to infringe on protected technology  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a license to use such technology  and it could incur substantial costs to redesign them and or defend legal actions 
the company has procedures to maintain the secrecy of its confidential business information 
these procedures include criteria for dissemination of information and written confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers 
suppliers  when engaged in joint research projects  are required to enter into 
table of contents additional confidentiality agreements 
while these efforts are taken seriously  there can be no assurance that these measures will prove adequate in all instances to protect the company s confidential information 
the company s code of conduct prohibits misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information of third parties 
the code of conduct is contained in the company s employee handbook and available to all employees on the company s website 
employees also sign an employee invention and confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information from third parties 
periodic training is provided to employees on this topic as well 
despite taking these steps  as well as others  the company cannot guarantee that these measures will be adequate in all instances to prevent misappropriation of trade secrets from third parties or the accusation by a third party that such misappropriation has taken place 
brand licensing the company licenses its trademarks to third party licensees who produce  market and sell their products bearing the company s trademarks 
the company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products  and on the manner  on which such trademarks may be used 
despite these restrictions  or if a licensee fails to adhere to these restrictions  the company s brand could be damaged by the use or misuse of the company s trademarks in connection with its licensees products 
product returns golf clubs 
the company supports all of its golf clubs with a limited two year written warranty 
since the company does not rely upon traditional designs in the development of its golf clubs  its products may be more likely to develop unanticipated problems than those of many of its competitors that use traditional designs 
for example  clubs have been returned with cracked clubheads  broken graphite shafts and loose medallions 
while any breakage or warranty problems are deemed significant by the company  the incidence of defective clubs returned to date has not been material in relation to the volume of clubs that have been sold 
the company monitors the level and nature of any golf club breakage and  where appropriate  seeks to incorporate design and production changes to assure its customers of the highest quality available in the market 
significant increases in the incidence of breakage or other product problems may adversely affect the company s sales and image with golfers 
the company believes that it has adequate reserves for warranty claims 
if the company were to experience an unusually high incidence of breakage or other warranty problems in excess of these reserves  the company s financial results would be adversely affected 
see above  critical accounting policies and estimates warranty 
golf balls 
the company has not experienced significant returns of defective golf balls  and in light of the quality control procedures implemented in the production of its golf balls  the company does not expect a significant amount of defective ball returns 
however  if future returns of defective golf balls were significant  it could have a material adverse effect upon the company s golf ball business 
gray market distribution some quantities of the company s products find their way to unapproved outlets or distribution channels 
this gray market for the company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the company s products  and can injure the company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers 
on the other hand  stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling callaway golf products to unauthorized distributors and or an increase in sales returns over historical levels 
while the company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce in its products in the gray market in both the us and abroad  it has not stopped such commerce 

table of contents international risks the company s management believes that controlling the distribution of its products in certain major markets in the world has been and will be an element in the future growth and success of the company 
the company sells and distributes its products directly as opposed to through third party distributors in many key international markets in europe  asia  north america and elsewhere around the world 
these activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory  accounts receivable  employees  corporate infrastructure and facilities 
in addition  there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the united states and the company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the united states 
the operation of foreign distribution in the company s international markets  as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors  will continue to require the dedication of management and other company resources 
as a result of this international business  the company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states 
in addition to foreign currency risks  these risks include i increased difficulty in protecting the company s intellectual property rights and trade secrets  ii unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements  iii social  economic or political instability  iv the effects of any anti american sentiments on the company s brands or sales of the company s products  v increased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the united states and vi increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or shipping services which interruptions could significantly adversely affect the company s ability to obtain timely delivery of components from international suppliers or to timely deliver its products to international customers 
although the company believes the benefits of conducting business internationally outweigh these risks  any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s operations and therefore financial performance and condition 
credit risk the company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries  and to foreign distributors 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers 
historically  the company s bad debt expense has been low 
however  a downturn in the retail golf equipment market could result in increased delinquent or uncollectable accounts for some of the company s significant customers 
in addition  as the company integrates its foreign distribution its exposure to credit risks increases as it no longer sells to a few wholesalers but rather directly to many retailers 
a failure by the company s customers to pay a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the company s performance and financial condition 
information systems all of the company s major operations  including manufacturing  distribution  sales and accounting  are dependent upon the company s information computer systems 
the callaway golf business information systems and the acquired top flite information systems are different and the company is therefore currently operating multiple platforms 
the company is in the process of evaluating whether to integrate the two systems and the best manner of doing so 
any significant disruption in the operation of such systems  as a result of an internal system malfunction  infection from an external computer virus  or complications in connection with any attempted integration of the two systems  or otherwise  would have a significant adverse effect upon the company s ability to operate its business 
although the company has taken steps to mitigate the effect of any such disruptions  there is no assurance that such steps would be adequate in a particular situation 
consequently  a significant or extended disruption in the operation of the company s information systems could have a material adverse effect upon the company s operations and therefore financial performance and condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
transactions involving these financial instruments are with credit worthy firms 
the use of these instruments exposes the company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties  although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
the company also utilized a derivative commodity instrument  the enron contract  to manage electricity costs in the volatile california energy market during the period of june through november pursuant to its terms  the enron contract was terminated 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facility 
foreign currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that could impact the company s results of operations 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments  including forwards and purchased options  to hedge certain of these exposures 
the company s objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge them  thereby reducing volatility of earnings 
the company does not enter into any trading or speculative positions with regard to foreign currency related derivative instruments 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent primarily in its sales commitments  anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company transacts business in currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to its operations are the european currencies  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollar  and australian dollar 
for most currencies  the company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefits from a weaker us dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the company transacts significant amounts of business 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such contracts are designated at inception to the related foreign currency exposures being hedged  which include anticipated intercompany sales of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  payments due on intercompany transactions from certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  and anticipated sales by the company s wholly owned european subsidiary for certain euro denominated transactions 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
to achieve hedge accounting  contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies 
pursuant to its foreign exchange hedging policy  the company may hedge anticipated transactions and the related receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies using forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts and put or call options 
foreign currency derivatives are used only to meet the company s objectives of minimizing variability in the company s operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
hedging contracts mature within twelve months from their inception 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s foreign exchange contracts were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates  and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
at december   the fair values of foreign currency related derivatives were recorded as current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
at december   the fair values of foreign currency related derivatives were recorded as current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehen 
table of contents sive income oci as a separate component of shareholders equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded the following hedging activity in oci year ended december  in millions beginning oci balance related to cash flow hedges add net gain loss initially recorded in oci deduct net gain loss reclassified from oci into earnings ending oci balance related to cash flow hedges during the years ended december  and  no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges 
during the year ended december   gains of million were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges 
as of december   million of deferred net losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were included in oci 
these derivative instruments hedge transactions that are expected to occur within the next twelve months 
as the hedged transactions are completed  the related deferred net gain or loss is reclassified from oci into earnings 
the company does not expect that such reclassifications will have a material effect on the company s earnings  as any gain or loss on the derivative instruments generally would be offset by the opposite effect on the related underlying transactions 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is immediately reported as a component of interest and other income 
for foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges  hedge effectiveness is measured using the spot rate 
changes in the spot forward differential are excluded from the test of hedging effectiveness and are recorded currently in earnings as a component of interest and other income 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded net gains of million  million and million  respectively  as a result of changes in the spot forward differential 
assessments of hedge effectiveness are performed using the dollar offset method and applying a hedge effectiveness ratio between and 
given that both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are evaluated using the same spot rate  the company anticipates the hedges to be highly effective 
the effectiveness of each derivative is assessed quarterly 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s foreign exchange contracts used to hedge outstanding balance sheet exposures were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the gains and losses on foreign currency contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures are recognized as a component of interest and other income in the same period as the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and thus offset these gains and losses 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded net losses of million and million and net gains of million  respectively  due to net realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures 
sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss in future earnings of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values 
the company used a sensitivity analysis model to quantify the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which the company was exposed at december  through its derivative financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 

table of contents the estimated maximum one day loss from the company s foreign currency derivative financial instruments  calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above  is million at december  the portion of the estimated loss associated with the foreign exchange contracts that offset the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities is million at december  and would impact earnings 
the remaining million of the estimated loss at december  is derived from outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and would initially impact oci 
the company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
electricity price fluctuations during the second quarter of  the company entered into the enron contract to manage electricity costs in the volatile california energy market 
this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
therefore  the company recognized the changes in the estimated fair value of the contract based on current market rates as unrealized energy derivative losses 
during the fourth quarter of  the company notified the energy supplier that  among other things  the energy supplier was in default of the energy supply contract and that based upon such default  and for other reasons  the company was terminating the energy supply contract 
as a result  the company adjusted the estimated value of this contract through the date of termination 
because the contract is terminated and neither party to the contract is performing pursuant to the terms of the contract  the terminated contract ceased to represent a derivative instrument in accordance with sfas no 
the company  therefore  no longer records future valuation adjustments for changes in electricity rates 
the company continues to reflect the derivative valuation account on its balance sheet  subject to periodic review  in accordance with sfas no
