item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements 
for the purposes of the following discussion  unless the context otherwise requires  too  inc  too  we  our  the company and us refer to too  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
executive overview a disappointing year all of us at too  inc were disappointed with last year s results 
spring and back to school season fashion missteps resulted in a net sales decline to million 
the sales decline coupled with the discontinuation of mishmash  our retail concept for teens and young women  resulted in a decrease in net income to million  or per diluted share 
these results include charges related to discontinued operations that reduced earnings by approximately million  net of tax  or per share 
sales results for the holiday season and the early spring season indicate our tween fashions are much improved 
this is due in part to last year s strategic decision to re focus exclusively on the tween girl 
in may  we simultaneously announced the discontinuation of mishmash and the launch of justice  our new retail concept for tween girls 
new tween concept justice is a unique retail concept  offering an exciting assortment of fashionable apparel  related accessories  and popular lifestyle items just for tween girls 
stores are being sited primarily in off the mall power retail and strip centers  locations different from limited too s mall based store fleet 
we are designing  sourcing  and merchandising virtually all of our apparel under our proprietary justice brand 
price points with the justice brand are competitive with off the mall mass merchants and discounters 
the company plans to open to justice stores in  with of those scheduled to open by april st 
we are clustering many of these stores in major metropolitan areas such as dallas  atlanta  chicago  philadelphia  and detroit in order to optimize field management costs and to better leverage future marketing plans 
justice stores average  square feet  about the same size as the average limited too 
the interior design of justice stores reflects the brand s value proposition  resulting in lower buildout costs 
also  strip center rents and associated common area maintenance charges are generally lower than traditional mall locations 
we believe justice is our best opportunity to gain incremental market share in the billion tween apparel market in retail strip centers that are most often frequented by value conscious customers 
renewed focus limited too our fashion missteps in were due in part to the loss of customer focus 
we concentrated on changing fashion trends in line with the juniors market and failed to meet the product expectations of our limited too customer 
we have since listened to the customer and have made the necessary changes that are reconnecting us with her 
we also made mid year organizational changes that drive a greater focus on our businesses 
further strengthening our customer focus we initiated a program that places merchandising teams in stores on a regular basis  allowing them to talk to customers and their parents and to learn more about their tastes 
we have also eliminated many other distractions that had diverted our attention from our customer  the tween girl 
discontinuing our teen concepts in may of  we announced the discontinuation of our mishmash concept for teen girls and the ending of our joint venture with specialty jewelry retailer angus coote holdings limited  which promoted their goldmark jewelry brand in our stores 
while we were initially encouraged by the overall trend of these businesses  we decided they would not reach the anticipated level of results as quickly as originally planned  given the intense level of competition from existing specialty retailers and other stores targeting teens 
we closed of mishmash stores and the four goldmark stores in the us four of the mishmash locations have since been converted to justice stores  an action that enables us to test the viability of justice in traditional shopping mall sites 
new store growth in  we opened new limited too stores  remodeled four  and completed five separations from the adjoining limited store 
we also closed six stores  ending the year with limited too stores in states and puerto rico 
average construction costs for new stores opened last year were per square foot  net of allowances  which was approximately below costs  and below the average three years ago 
our plan for calls for to new limited too stores and to justice stores  including the four converted locations 
limited too will also remodel approximately stores  many of which will result in either store expansion or relocation to a more advantageous position in the mall 
brand partnering extended limited too continues to create exciting marketing alliances with highly recognizable consumer brands that are popular with tween girls 
hasbro s tiger electronics  maker of the popular hitclips discs micro music systems  is the preferred electronics partner of limited too 
hasbro s wizards of the coast launched their star sisterz collectable charm game exclusively with limited too this spring 
lego s clikits remains the preferred fashion designer kits at limited too  and nestle sweetarts is beginning its third year as the preferred candy for our core brand 
our licensing agreement with build a bear workshop  an interactive entertainment retailer where guests create one of a kind plush animals  has been successful and is entering its second year 
last fall  mcdonald s restaurants throughout the us distributed a discount coupon for limited too stores on more than million mighty kids meal bags and sponsored a national television advertising campaign highlighting special savings opportunities 
the advertisements showcased some of our holiday apparel styles on many of the youth orientated networks 
based on the success of the first campaign  limited too has partnered with mcdonald s and lego s clikits for another cross promotion during march and april of this year 
the significance of our preferred partnerships and licensing programs goes beyond the heightened visibility they give our brands 
they are an important source of revenue  providing approximately million in added revenue last year principally from advertising in our catazine catalog with editorial comment  as well as creating cost effective means to accessing other forms of advertising media such as television 
new credit agreement in april  too  inc entered into a new credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a million unsecured revolving loan commitment 
the new facility will give us greater access to working capital  if necessary  and provide lower financing costs than the former facility 
more importantly  the company ended the year with no debt and million in cash 
given our strong cash position and current economic model  we expect to internally fund substantially all of our capital needs  while generating to million in cash flow 
direct sourcing benefit following a successful small scale test two years ago  the company expanded its direct sourcing of apparel in through our hong kong office  we have contracted with a number of reliable  high quality apparel manufacturers throughout the pacific rim 
we also have a western hemisphere sourcing team that is identifying dependable producers for our goods in this part of the world 
at year end  we were direct sourcing about of limited too s apparel and expect to increase that penetration to to this year 
results of operations on may   the company announced the discontinuation of its mishmash retail concept  and all mishmash stores were closed by november  accordingly  mishmash s operating results have been reflected as discontinued operations in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates only to too  inc s continuing operations 
net sales for the year ended january  were million  a decrease of from for the fiscal year

further  stores that have changed more than in square feet are treated as new stores for purposes of this calculation 
annual sales per average square foot is the result of dividing net sales for the fiscal year by average gross square feet  which reflects the impact of opening and closing stores throughout the year 
annual sales per average store is the result of dividing net sales for the fiscal year by average store count  which reflects the impact of opening and closing stores throughout the year 
net sales fiscal net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million for the decrease was primarily a result of a decline in comparable store sales  which was partially offset by the net addition of limited too stores 
the decrease in comparable store sales was attributable to fashion missteps in both the spring and back to school apparel assortments  which incorporated styles and colors prevalent in junior fashions  but were not popular with limited too s core tween customer 
inconsistent mall traffic and competition from off the mall retailers also contributed to the decline 
virtually all of the company s apparel categories experienced average store sales decreases during fiscal however  the non apparel portion of the business performed well as accessories  lifestyles  innerwear and athletic footwear posted double digit average store increases for the year 
the introduction of the fun zone area  located in the front corner of our stores  was a major factor in the improvement of the non apparel sales performance 
for spring  the apparel assortment will include more color  glitter and greater embellishment 
the company will also continue to expand the fun zone concept  which highlights non apparel items such as accessories  jewelry  room decor  electronics  music  candy  and personal care products

conversely  casual shorts and casual pants posted sales decreases over prior year 
gross income fiscal the gross income rate  expressed as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in fiscal from for the rate decrease was due to higher markdowns to clear slow moving spring and back to school merchandise 
the rate decline was further exacerbated by the deleveraging of fixed buying and occupancy costs such as rent and depreciation due to the negative comparable store sales performance 
incremental catazines production costs also contributed to the rate decline 
the company mailed approximately million catazines in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the gross income rate  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal from for the increase in rate was primarily attributable to a higher merchandise margin arising from improved initial markups  which was partially offset by an increase in markdowns 
also offsetting the improved merchandise margin was an increase in buying and occupancy costs  expressed as a percentage of net sales  due to increased store occupancy costs and incremental catazine production costs 
the company mailed approximately million catazines in fiscal compared to million in general  administrative and store operating expenses fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal from for despite a million decline in dollars from the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to lower home office expenses  as well as a decrease in distribution center costs 
home office expenses decreased due to a number of factors including lower incentive compensation expense resulting from the company s disappointing financial performance  settlement proceeds received in lieu of a litigation claim  and certain one time expenses incurred in for brand protection litigation  tax consulting and start up costs associated with the company s new home office 
distribution center costs have continued to decline since the company opened its new facility in early fiscal the cost improvement is primarily a result of productivity gains  as measured in core units processed per labor hour

fiscal loss from discontinued operations increased to million in fiscal from million in the increase was primarily due to increased store payroll costs from the addition of five stores during fiscal financial condition our balance sheet remains strong due to positive cash flows from operations 
we were able to finance all capital expenditures with working capital generated from operations and ended the year with approximately million in cash 
a more detailed discussion of liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements follows

inventory levels at the end of fiscal decreased by on an average store basis from the end of the decrease in inventories was due to a combination of early receipts of spring goods prior to the end of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  missed sales in late december and january of fiscal during fiscal  the company incurred non cash charges as a result of discontinuing the company s mishmash retail concept  as well as ending the company s involvement in the goldmark joint venture 
the impairment charge consisted of the write off of the mishmash fixed assets and store supplies and the investment in goldmark 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in from was due to an increase in inventory levels  an increase in other long term assets and the timing of income tax payments  which more than offset the increase in net income plus depreciation and accrued expenses 
the increase in inventory levels was due to a combination of an increase in new stores  early receipt of spring goods in january and  to a lesser extent  missed sales in late december and the month of january 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities in versus was due to a decrease in capital expenditures and the funding of the company s nonqualified benefit plans  which was partially offset by restricted cash

we intend to add  to  square feet in  which will represent a to increase over year end we anticipate that the increase will result from opening approximately to new limited too stores and expanding about half of the approximately stores identified for remodeling

transitional services and separation agreements in connection with the august spin off  the company entered into several transitional services and separation agreements the transitional services agreements with the limited regarding certain aspects of our ongoing relationship

the limited has the right to terminate the trademark agreement under certain limited conditions 
services agreement the services agreement relates to transitional services that the limited or its subsidiaries or affiliates provided to us subsequent to the spin off 
under this agreement  the limited provided services in exchange for fees which we believe were similar in material respects to what a third party provider would charge  and were based on several billing methodologies 
under one of these billing methodologies  which was the most prevalent  the limited provided us with services at costs comparable to those charged to other businesses operated by the limited from time to time 
we were generally obligated to purchase those services at fees equal to the limited s costs of providing the services plus of these costs

the old credit facility s interest rates  which reflected matrix pricing  were based on the london interbank offered rate or prime plus a spread as defined in the agreement 
the term loan was interest only until the end of the third year at which time the amortization of the outstanding principal balance would have begun 
the old credit facility contained customary representations and warranties as well as certain affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
in november  the company amended the old credit facility

impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  long lived assets and sales returns 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from management s estimates 
management believes the following estimates and assumptions are most significant to reporting the company s results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition retail sales are recorded when the customer takes possession of merchandise 
markdowns associated with the frequent buyer and too bucks programs are recognized upon redemption in conjunction with a qualifying purchase 
catalog and web sales are recorded upon shipment of merchandise to the customer  which approximates the amount of revenue that would be recognized if sales were recorded upon receipt by the customer 
a reserve is provided for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in  first out basis  utilizing the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the use of the retail method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market when markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value and cost of inventories 
inherent in the retail method are certain management judgments and estimates including  among others  future sales  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the company calculates inventory costs on an individual item class basis to ensure a high degree of accuracy in estimating the cost 
inventory valuation at the end of the first and third quarters reflects adjustments for inventory markdowns and shrinkage estimates for the total selling season 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
service lives are established for store assets ranging from to years for leasehold improvements and to years for other property and equipment 
property and equipment at the home office and distribution center are assigned service lives between and years
