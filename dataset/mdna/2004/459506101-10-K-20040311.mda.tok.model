the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented  both geographically and along product lines  there are few publicly traded companies in the industry  limiting publicly available data  certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling at least a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs  and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited 
however  analysts generally estimate the flavor and fragrance market to be billion of which iff represents  the company s nearest sized competitor is of similar size

fragrance compounds are used in perfumes  cosmetics  toiletries  hair care products  deodorants  soaps  detergents and softeners as well as air care products

approximately of the company s ingredient production is consumed internally  the balance of production is sold to third party customers 
changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income and dual earner households  leisure time  health concerns  urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances 
these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality  as well as the market for colognes and toiletries 
such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods  soft drinks and low cholesterol and low fat food products that must conform to expected tastes 
these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products 
flavors and fragrances are generally o created for the exclusive use of a specific customer  o sold in solid or liquid form  in amounts ranging from a few kilograms to many tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used  o a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer  and o a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product

o to critically evaluate the profitability and growth potential of the company s product portfolio 
o to revitalize and redirect research and development initiatives to those areas considered to be most likely  in the long term  to yield the greatest value to the company s customers and shareholders

the company exited certain non core businesses  contributing to improved returns on sales and invested capital 
the quality and depth of the company s research and development efforts has improved significantly 
in  the company patented fifteen new  commercially viable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances  these ingredients will begin to be commercialized in flavor and fragrance compounds in moving forward  the company remains committed to o continuous improvement in operations and customer service supported by the global implementation of an enterprise requirements planning software package sap  and related initiatives 
o research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the company has identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth

the company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at december  critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  actual results may differ from such estimates 
the diversity of the company s products  customers  geographic operations  sources of supply and markets reduces the risk that any one event would have a severe impact on the company s operating results 
the company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the greatest complexity of the company s business is in the area of research and development and creation of new products  for which all costs are expensed as incurred 
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the company s financial reporting involve o the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  o the evaluation of potential environmental and legal liabilities  where frequently changing rules  regulations and circumstances require constant reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  o determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  o recoverability and realization of assets  most notably in lesser developed areas of the world where fluctuating currencies and frequently unsettled economic conditions can create uncertainty  o the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory  given the large number of natural ingredients employed  the quality of which may be diminished over time  and o the determination of financial instruments employed as effective hedges of cash flows or market risk exposures 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that the company may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the company for the years presented
