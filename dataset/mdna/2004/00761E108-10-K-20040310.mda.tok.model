item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview advanced power technology  inc is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of high performance power semiconductors and modules for radio frequency rf  linear  and switchmode applications 
power semiconductors manage and regulate electrical power by converting electricity into a form required by electrical and electronic products 
our power semiconductors increase system efficiency  permit the design of more compact end products and improve features and functionality 
we are primarily focused on the high power  high frequency segment of the power semiconductor market 
high power refers to the ability to dissipate above one kilowatt  and high frequency refers to the ability to switch on and off at rates above kilohertz 
in addition  we continue to strengthen our portfolio of rf products that operate at frequencies ranging from megahertz to megahertz 
rf generally refers to the ability to operate at frequencies above megahertz 
we sell our products primarily in north america  europe  and asia  through a network of independent sales representatives and distributors 
the acquisition of ghz technology  inc and the business of microsemi rf products  inc in helped us to further penetrate rf markets 
we believe that these acquisitions serve to position apt as an emerging  dominant supplier in bipolar rf power transistors for avionics  radar and non cellular communications applications operating at frequency ranges from megahertz to multiple gigahertz and add valuable rf technology and substantial rf engineering  manufacturing and marketing capability to the company 
these acquisitions are part of the company s ongoing strategy to expand its product and technology portfolio in the rf power arena through both internal development and acquisitions 
apt has operations in bend  oregon  santa clara  california  montgomeryville  pennsylvania  and bordeaux  france 
each site has production  research and development and administrative activities 
we also make use of subcontract manufacturers for the fabrication of our wafers and for assembly and test operations 
our operation locations are more fully described in item of this report 
business environment apt operates on a worldwide basis 
as such  our operations are affected by global  regional  and industry economic and political factors 
however  the company s geographic and market segment diversity serves to limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results 
in  approximately of our revenues were from customers in the united states  from customers in europe  and from customers in asia and the rest of the world 
the principal end user markets for our products are communications and data processing  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial medical  and military aerospace 
our revenues are impacted by the overall semiconductor market and the resulting demand for semiconductor capital equipment  capital spending in the communications industry  government and corporate spending on military and aerospace programs  and the overall general economic and political conditions 
we believe there are two significant factors driving the general demand for high performance power semiconductors rapid proliferation of sophisticated electronics  and the increasing need for higher power and more precisely regulated power quality in electronic equipment 
we plan to utilize and further develop our technology in order to supply high performance power semiconductors designed to meet these demands 
the use of power semiconductors is becoming more pervasive in electronic devices to convert and control electricity that powers these devices 
as a result  the power semiconductor market is a large and growing segment of the semiconductor industry 
the proliferation of consumer electronic devices  wireless communication  and mobile computing is driving demand for new generations of power semiconductors that are smaller  lighter and more efficient 
at the same time  we believe applications in the areas of medical and industrial products will create additional demand for more powerful and reliable power semiconductors 
these applications include military and aerospace systems  defibrillators  medical imaging  arc welding  and projection systems 
business strategies we believe that the key success factors for apt over the near term horizon are to increase the rf power products share of our total revenues  to improve the balance between our diversified markets  focus on new product opportunities for our power products  to further reduce production costs and operating expenses through the consolidation of our manufacturing operations and administrative functions  and continue to further leverage our lower cost subcontract manufacturers 
on average  rf power products provide higher gross margins than switching products  but also require a higher level of engineering support 
apt plans to continue its strategy to increase rf power revenues through internal development or acquisition 
the implosion of the internet bubble in demonstrated clearly that over reliance on specific markets can lead to rapid growth followed by rapid decline 
achieving satisfactory financial performance in the face of significant cyclical swings is extremely difficult 
our product and market strategies are aimed at achieving a relatively equal balance between the markets we serve 
our power products business has been historically weighted towards semiconductor capital equipment and communications markets 
our strategy is to find new opportunities in the power products business in industrial and medical applications 
we plan to continue to rationalize and consolidate our internal manufacturing operations  in light of past acquisitions and possibly for any future acquisitions we might make  and to continue increased utilization of lower cost offshore subcontractors in order to lower our overall manufacturing costs 
apt s financial performance and ability to successfully execute these plans are subject to a number of risks  and actual results may differ materially 
factors that could affect the company s actual results include the ability of subcontractors to meet their delivery commitments  unfavorable changes in industry and competitive conditions  the company s mix of product shipments  the accuracy of customers forecasts  the effectiveness of the company s efforts to control and reduce costs  the cost and liability associated with patent infringement litigation  and other uncertainties more further disclosed later in this section of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates advanced power technology s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires apt to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  apt evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns and warranty obligations  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  income taxes  valuation of intangible assets including goodwill  valuation of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation  and excess component order cancellation costs 
apt bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
apt believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product returns and warranty obligations product revenue is recognized upon shipment of product 
in general  apt provides for a one year repair or replacement warranty on its products 
upon shipment  apt provides for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty and sales returns based on historical experience 
apt uses independent distributors to sell some of its products 
distributors can return a contractually agreed upon percentage of the dollar value of products purchased during the prior six months and receive certain price protections on purchased products 
sales to distributors are recognized upon shipment  less an allowance for estimated returns based on historical experience 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  apt s warranty obligation is affected by product non conformance rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product non conformance 
should actual product non conformance rates  material usage  service delivery costs  or distributor returns differ from apt s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts apt maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  historical bad debts  the customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
management reviews significant individual accounts that are past due to determine whether an allowance should be made based on these factors 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
apt establishes reserves for estimated unmarketable excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
apt establishes reserves for excess component order cancellation costs based on estimated net realizable value of the components purchased and any additional cancellation charges 
apt evaluates historical usage of the product  current customer demand  purchase commitments and forecasted usage of the product 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
income taxes apt records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
apt considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event apt were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should apt determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
during  the company determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives apt values goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
currently apt carries a goodwill balance in connection with previous acquisitions  but has no other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we annually review goodwill for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might exceed its current fair value 
we determine fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and other acceptable valuation methodologies such as market multiples and comparable transactions 
this requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and industry 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge as a result of writing down the carrying value of goodwill 
valuation of long lived assets apt values long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we determine the potential impairment using undiscounted cash flow analysis  which requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and industry 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge as a result of writing down the carrying value of long lived assets 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
long lived assets considered held for sale are valued at the lower of historical cost or fair value less costs to sell 
such assets are not depreciated while so classified 
contingencies and litigation apt is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted

our revenues for were million  compared to million in  or a increase 
approximately of the increase reflects the additional months of revenue contributed by the acquisitions we made during  while of the increase represents organic growth on higher unit volumes 
overall we experienced year over year strength in each of the markets we serve 
communications and data processing revenue increased by  semiconductor capital equipment increased by  military and aerospace increased by and industrial medical increased by 
as a result of incremental capital spending by companies that produce semiconductors  we experienced significant strengthening in the semiconductor capital equipment market which grew by in the second half of compared to the first half 
although we saw strengthening in the communications and data processing market  there had not yet been a substantial and sustained increase in infrastructure spending which is necessary for apt to significantly expand revenues within this market 
based on the strength in the semiconductor capital equipment market we saw in over  it now appears that we have firmly entered a period of sustained growth for this segment 
however  this does not preclude quarterly variability 
apt s customers in the semiconductor capital equipment market have designed our products into a broad array of both their current and emerging technologies which positions us well for future growth 
in the industrial medical market our designs into medical imaging and defibrillator applications continue to drive the growth in this segment 
as expected  revenues in the fourth quarter of in the military and aerospace market decreased sequentially from the third quarter of  tempering the overall year over year gain 
order activity was strong in the fourth quarter of we expect to benefit from increased spending on military programs as well as from designs we have won in aviation and radar systems in foreign market places 
overall  our revenues by geographic area for was in north america  in europe  and in asia and the rest of the world 
this compares to in north america  in europe and in asia and the rest of the world in we expect to see asia contribute more to revenue growth in gross profit 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in excluding the non cash purchase accounting charges for the fair value of inventory acquired and the amortization of the technology rights assets  gross profit margin was in compared to in  or an increase of 
lower sales returns and lower provisions for excess and obsolescent inventory contributed approximately to the improved gross margin 
increased production volumes and the resulting increased factory utilization at our facility in santa clara  california resulted in improved factory overhead absorption in compared to the improved utilization added approximately to our overall gross profit in we expect to see production volume for the products from both our bend  oregon facility and our santa clara facility to increase resulting in further margin enhancement during the margin improvement due to increased utilization was partially offset by lower factory production volumes at our facility in bordeaux  france which caused a drop of approximately in our gross margin 
the company has taken actions to reduce production personnel by at the bordeaux facility and shift production to our lower cost offshore subcontractors 
we expect this process to be completed in the second half of during we began the process to consolidate the silicon manufacturing currently performed in montgomeryville  pennsylvania to our bend oregon facility in order to reduce our overall wafer fabrication production costs 
we expect to complete the transfer in research and development expense 
our research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenues  respectively 
during  higher expenses were incurred for pre production and prototype lots  especially for our power mos technology  as the company prepared to introduce a large volume of new products in this technology 
during  fewer resources were used for pre production and prototype lots as the new parts moved into full production 
this resulted in an approximately  decline in spending on supplies  materials and prototypes over the prior year 
during we also had lower payroll by  due to the transfer of engineers to product application functions 
the decrease in the research and development expense as a percentage of revenue is also due to our higher revenue levels in the company plans to continue its research and development programs leading to the introduction of new products for use in both switching and rf applications 
therefore  we expect the level of research and development expenses to be approximately over sustained periods of time 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses over the prior year level is attributable to higher payroll costs of million as a result of the discontinuance of the graduated pay reductions we implemented in and the first half of  as well as additional personnel in selling  general and administrative functions due to new hires  the additional companies we acquired  and to the transferring of job functions from other operating areas of the company 
in addition we incurred increased legal expenses of  in connection with ongoing patent litigation  as more fully explained in part i  item to this report 
we have denied infringement of the ixys patents and have asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
however  the length of time and legal fees associated with patent litigation with ixys may be significant 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements  and is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant of options and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock 
stock compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  typically five years 
stock compensation expense of  was recorded in versus  in of this amount   was recorded in cost of goods sold   was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect to record stock compensation expense of approximately  in interest income expense 
interest income in was  compared to  in the decline in interest income was due to lower invested cash balances as a result of cash used to acquire ghz and msc rf in and also due to lower interest rates available in the current market environment 
interest expense was  in compared to  in restructuring charges 
as part of management s strategic plans  the company announced in november of restructuring actions intended to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower administrative costs 
the actions include consolidation of certain administrative functions  rationalization of internal and external assembly and test manufacturing  and the reduction of rent expense through the purchase and resale of one of the two buildings currently occupied by the company s santa clara  california subsidiary 
these announced actions were in addition to previously dislosed plans to consolidate our wafer fabrication plant in montgomeryville  pennsylvania to bend  oregon 
total restructuring related charges recognized in were  not all restructuring activities were completed as of december  as such  management expects that additional restructuring charges of approximately  will be incurred in the total severance related charges recognized in was  the severance charges relate to already separated personnel and personnel that are eligible for benefits upon completion of certain transfer activities 
the building buyout reduced our operating lease commitments by approximately  over and the building purchase is reported as an asset held for sale and is being marketed for sale as apt no longer requires the space 
in accordance with sfas  an asset held for sale is carried at estimated fair value 
as such  apt recorded an impairment charge for the building in the fourth quarter of of approximately  the net carrying value of the building as of december  was approximately million and is included as a component of other current assets 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax expense of approximately on our net loss of million in  compared to a tax benefit of in our effective tax rate in differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the recording of a non cash charge of  to establish a full valuation reserve against our net deferred tax assets  offset by a reduction in our taxes payable by  in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets  sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires a more likely than not standard 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future domestic taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
although the company anticipates future long term profitability  sfas no 
requires that recent historical operating performance weigh more heavily in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets 
the more likely than not assessment was principally based upon the losses generated during and and the cyclical nature of the industry which make projections of industry trends difficult 
as of december   apt has federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively  which expire beginning in years through years ended december  and revenues 
our revenues for were million  including million from ghz technology  inc ghz and the business of microsemi rf products  inc msc rf  a wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi corporation  which apt acquired effective january  and may   respectively 
this represents an increase of compared to the revenues of million in without the additional revenues from our acquisitions  revenues were million in  representing a decline of over the prior year 
the semiconductor market experienced record growth up to october  followed by record declines in as apt typically lags the overall semiconductor industry  our revenues peaked in the first quarter of and then we experienced sequentially declining revenues through the fourth quarter of our revenues had quarterly increases from the low levels of the second half of  but still remain below the levels achieved in on a year to date basis excluding the impact of acquisitions 
we experienced sequential revenue growth of in each of the first and second quarters of  in the third quarter of  followed by a decline in the fourth quarter of  when excluding revenues from both of our acquisitions 
the year over year decline is mainly due to continued weakness of our revenues into the communications and data processing market  which remains well below levels 
including the impact of the companies acquired  the increase in revenues is largely attributable to increased revenues in the military and aerospace market 
the additional revenues contributed by our acquisitions are heavily weighted towards the military and aerospace market and the communications and data processing market  and therefore serve to more evenly diversify our overall revenues from the various markets that we participate in 
in addition  the revenues from the acquired companies significantly increase our position in the rf power market  consistent with our long established strategy 
during  we entered into a joint venture agreement in china  which included a license and technology transfer agreement for certain of our technologies  in exchange for cash payments totaling million over two to three years 
there were no revenues recognized from the agreement during and apt terminated this agreement in february of in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as a result  apt will not receive any future payments relative to this agreement 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in excluding the non cash purchase accounting charges for the fair value of inventory acquired and the amortization of the technology rights assets  gross profit margin was compared to in  which had no purchase accounting charges 
as described above  our revenues peaked in the first quarter of and then subsequently declined through the fourth quarter of accordingly  our gross profit margin in the first half of was followed by in the second half of due to the much lower levels of production and under utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities 
during  we experienced quarterly increases in revenues and production volumes  leading to improved utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities 
we also began to benefit from the cost reduction actions taken in the second half of  as more fully described in the versus gross profit section below  such as reducing our overall production personnel levels by approximately or about employees 
also contributing to our improved gross margins in is the higher content of our rf power business due to the acquisitions made during the year  which carry a higher overall gross profit rate 
our rf revenues were approximately of total revenue in compared to in research and development expense 
our research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increased spending over the prior year is primarily due to the additions of ghz and msc rf  which contributed million in  consisting mainly of payroll  supplies  facilities and depreciation charges 
excluding the impact of ghz and msc rf  research and development charges remained flat over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increased spending over the prior year is primarily due to the additions of ghz and msc rf  which contributed million in  consisting mainly of payroll  commissions  facilities  and depreciation charges 
excluding the impact of ghz and msc rf  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat over the prior year 
the graduated pay reductions implemented in were discontinued in the third quarter of we did experience increased legal expenses over in connection with ongoing patent litigation  as more fully explained in part i  item of this report 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements  and is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant of options and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock 
stock compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  typically five years 
stock compensation expense of  was recorded in versus  in of this amount   was recorded in cost of goods sold   was recorded in research and development expense and  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
interest income expense 
interest income in was  compared to million in the decline in interest income was due to the use of cash and investments to acquire ghz and msc rf and also due to lower interest rates available in the current market environment 
interest expense was  in compared to  in income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit for at an effective tax rate of approximately compared to a tax expense of in the effective tax rate benefit in was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the in process research and development charges recorded for financial statement purposes in the ghz acquisition under gaap which are not deductible for tax purposes 
this was partially offset by the benefit of a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the realization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and non taxable municipal interest income 
the effective tax rate expense in was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the realization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and non taxable municipal interest income 
net loss 
although our revenues increased in over  we experienced a net loss of  versus net income of  in as a result of our acquisitions during fiscal  we recorded acquisition related charges for purchased in process research and development ipr d  amortization of intangible assets  inventory fair value adjustments and deferred compensation amortization of  of which  was included in costs of good sold and  in operating expenses 
the total amount net of taxes was  without these purchase related charges our net loss in would have been this decline in profit is primarily due to a decline in revenues on our existing business before acquisitions  resulting in lower gross profit while our operating expenses remained relatively flat on a before acquisition basis 
this resulted in an operating loss on our existing business  which was partially offset by an operating profit on our acquired business 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing  and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  and access to bank credit when required and at reasonable rates 
the company s key cash flow metrics for the last five years are presented in part i  item  selected financial data of this report 
operating cash flows in  we generated approximately million from operating activities 
this resulted from our net loss of million offset by non cash charges for depreciation  amortization  asset impairment of million  deferred tax valuation allowance of  inventory provisions of  and deferred compensation amortization of  our collections from customers were approximately million in compared to million in the net change in working capital accounts resulted in a use of cash of  as revenues increased over the prior year  we increased investment in inventory and accounts receivable offset by larger accounts payable balances 
investing cash flows in  we generated approximately million in investing activities  which consisted mainly of purchases of plant and equipment for million  including million to purchase an administrative building and buyout an above market lease see restructuring charges above  offset by the net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of million 
financing cash flows in  we generated approximately  from financing activities  which consisted of net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options offset by payments on lease obligations 
as of december   apt had million in working capital 
our trade accounts receivable balance was million reflecting a days sales outstanding ratio of days  compared to trade accounts receivable of million at december   reflecting a days sales outstanding ratio of days 
based on the geographic mix of our customers and the credit terms we extend  management expects our days sales outstanding ratio to range from to days 
our inventory balance was million reflecting inventory turns of times per year  compared to an inventory balance of million at december   reflecting inventory turns of times per year 
the company continues to pursue actions to monitor inventory levels and improve inventory turns 
the calculations above are based on yearly average balances of trade accounts receivable and inventory  adjusted to include the related opening balances from our acquisitions 
apt currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds and financing arrangements if needed 
as of december   apt had million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
apt s investment policy is to invest in short term  high grade liquid investments with the goal of capital preservation 
apt s ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be affected by market conditions as well as other risk factors as described below 
we expect from time to time to evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our market strategy 
to the extent we pursue such transactions  we could require additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities or to fund our working capital requirements in the event of an industry downturn or an unexpected adverse change in our business operations 
to the extent we require additional capital we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments as of december  and the company did not have any unconsolidated entities or off balance sheet financial arrangements  guarantees or similar commitments with such entities 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  is presented in the table below

r was issued  which replaces fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the guidelines of the interpretation will become applicable for the company in its first quarter financial statements 
the company currently has no equity investments that fall within the scope of fin no

such forward looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could materially alter results in the future from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  us 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those listed in this report 
we caution you that such forward looking statements are only predictions and actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements  you should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including the factors that we discuss below 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report  to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
the semiconductor industry is very cyclical  and an industry downturn would reduce our revenues 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
in the past  business conditions in this industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand to periods of weak demand 
any future downturn in the industry could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and expect these fluctuations to continue  which may cause our common stock price to decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and operating results 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to expand manufacturing output to meet increasing demand  the timing and extent of our research and development expenses  and fluctuations in manufacturing yields 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new proprietary products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products  then our operating results will be harmed 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
because most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of fixed costs in the semiconductor industry  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in future periods 
if we cannot introduce new products on a timely basis  our financial results may suffer 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
our success depends upon our ability to develop improved power semiconductors for new and existing markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner  and to have these products gain market acceptance 
the development of new power semiconductors is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion of design and testing of new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers 
we cannot assure you we will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
due to the complexity and variety of power semiconductors  the limited number of qualified development engineers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of such circuits  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that any products introduced by us will be adopted by existing or potential customers  or that any products initially accepted by our customers will become industry standard products 
our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could significantly harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
our results of operations are also dependent on our ability to optimize the mix between sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume products and relatively higher volume but lower margin products 
in order to improve our margins  sales of higher margin products must in the future represent a greater percentage of our revenues  requiring us to develop  introduce and market new proprietary products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in our key markets will demand 
disruption  termination or reduction in the functions performed by our key subcontractors could reduce our revenues 
we are increasingly more reliant on third party subcontractors in europe and asia for manufacturing  assembly and packaging of most of our products 
we have entered into a wafer foundry agreement with infineon technologies  an outside foundry located in europe  which currently provides a significant percentage of our wafers 
in addition  during we signed a wafer foundry agreement with episil technologies  located in taiwan 
our agreement with infineon extends indefinitely and requires a two year notice of termination 
our agreement with episil technologies extends indefinitely and requires a one year notice of termination 
we also rely on agreements with team pacific and psi technologies  subcontractors in the philippines  for assembly and packaging of most of our switching power semiconductor products 
our agreement with team pacific extends through january  and requires team pacific to assemble all products we send them  based on rolling periodic forecasts 
our agreement with psi technologies extends through december  in addition  we rely on subcontractor services from vertek international  inc in mexico and semiconductor assembler manufacturer  sdn 
bhd 
sam in malaysia for assembly and packaging of our rf and microwave products 
the agreements with vertek and sam are governed by purchase orders which are periodically renewed 
disruption or termination of these arrangements could harm our business and operating results 
political instability  labor disputes or natural disasters could disrupt the operations of our subcontractors 
if any of our subcontractors experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to us  our operating results would suffer until alternate subcontractors  if any  become available 
our subcontractors may not be able to maintain the technological capability to meet our future needs 
in addition  our subcontractors also manufacture and package products for our competitors  and there is a risk that our subcontractors could allocate less of their production capacity and resources to our needs 
if our manufacturing processes become obsolete  our margins and profitability will be harmed 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development in order to improve product performance and increase manufacturing yields 
we cannot assure you that our current process technology will not become obsolete 
if we are unable to develop or obtain access to advanced silicon wafer processing technologies as they become needed  our future operating results will suffer 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to obtain or maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
our competitors may  however  misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours 
we cannot assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
moreover  the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot assure you that our current patents are or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage to us 
we may also become subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources and could harm our financial results 
in addition  we have licensed a portion of our intellectual property rights to european and japanese entities and entered into a joint venture and licensing and technology transfer agreement in china 
the china agreement was subsequently terminated effective in february of intellectual property law and practice differs in foreign jurisdictions  and it may prove difficult for us to protect our rights in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that our licensing and other arrangements with foreign entities will not result in infringements on our proprietary rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  either in the us or abroad  we could face increased competition in the market for our products and technologies  which could negatively affect our revenues and ability to expand our business 
we may become involved in costly and lengthy patent infringement or intellectual property litigation  which could harm our business 
the semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
protecting our proprietary rights may require us to defend claims of intellectual property infringement by our competitors 
if any such infringements arise or are claimed in the future  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners  discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
we cannot be certain that licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we could successfully develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
moreover  such efforts would likely be time consuming and divert management attention and resources 
our future involvement in patent infringement or intellectual property litigation could harm our operating results and financial condition 
although none of our patents or intellectual property rights has been successfully challenged to date  we have been sued by ixys corporation for purportedly infringing two of its patents covering power mosfets 
we have denied infringement of the ixys patents and have asserted affirmative defenses to our claims 
trial is tentatively scheduled to commence in july of we intend to contest ixys s claims vigorously but the outcome of this litigation remains uncertain 
no assurance can be provided that a court ruling unfavorable to apt would not materially harm our business 
in addition  the length of time and legal fees associated with the patent litigation with ixys may be significant 
additionally  in the future we could be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other third parties 
we also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual rights by our products 
no assurance can be provided that any future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or that assertions of infringement if proven to be true will not harm our business 
strong competition in the power semiconductor market may reduce the demand for our products or the prices of our products  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
the power semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in the power semiconductor market include product features and performance  product quality  product reliability  technical knowledge  breadth of product line  competitive pricing  and customer service and support 
because the market for power semiconductors is diverse and highly fragmented  we encounter different competitors in our various product markets 
our principal competitors in one or more of our product areas include fairchild semiconductor  international rectifier  ixys  ma com  motorola  philips and st microelectronics 
many of our competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do 
we expect intensified competition from existing power semiconductor suppliers and the possible entry of new competitors 
increased competition could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our financial condition or our operating results 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could harm our business and our financial condition 
our financial results would be harmed if we were to lose one of our major customers or key distributors 
several of our major customers account for a significant portion of our revenues each year 
during  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenues  and one distributor  richardson electronics ltd  accounted for of our revenues 
revenues from advanced energy industries  inc represented of revenues in if we lost richardson electronics ltd or one of our other major customers  or if one of them reduced or canceled significant orders  our net income and operating results could be harmed 
richardson electronics ltd serves as a significant distributor of our products 
if this relationship were discontinued  or if richardson electronics ltd should fail to provide adequate service to our customers  we could lose revenues and our operating results would suffer 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability 
we have at times experienced periods of rapid revenue growth  and we anticipate future growth if demand increases in the markets for our products 
to manage this growth successfully  we will need to manage increased production requirements  attract  retain and train new employees and management  improve our operational and administrative systems  and manage multiple relationships with customers and suppliers 
we may be unable to accomplish any of these requirements  and our failure to do so would harm our operating results 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully into our business 
we have made two acquisitions since we became a public company in august of  and we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses 
the expense incurred in consummating the future acquisition of related businesses  or our failure to integrate such businesses successfully into our existing businesses  could result in our company incurring unanticipated expenses and losses 
in addition  we may not be able to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions we do complete 
in the event of future acquisitions  we could use a significant portion of our available cash  issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
should we successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with acquisitions include difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or joint venture  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
our ability to successfully manage these risks would be limited by the small size of our management team 
our business is subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
in  approximately of our revenues were to customers located outside of the us we are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  currency fluctuations  credit risk and difficulties in staffing and management of overseas operations 
in addition  we have supply agreements  assembly agreements  and other relationships with foreign companies that are subject to similar risks 
failure to attract and retain key technical and management personnel could harm our operating results 
our success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  particularly our development engineers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly experienced development engineers  systems applications engineers and sales managers 
there is intense competition for the services of development engineers in our industry 
the loss of the services of one or more of our development engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could harm our business 
we do not currently carry life insurance payable to apt with respect to any of our employees 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  defects or other performance problems may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may also cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers 
any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses 
even an unsuccessful product liability claim would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
interruptions in wafer production may harm our operating results 
any prolonged inability to utilize our bend  oregon foundry or third party foundries as a result of fire  natural disaster or otherwise would harm our financial condition and cause our operating results to suffer 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our revenues would likely be reduced 
we may not be able to make arrangements for additional foundry capacity in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our operating results 
we depend on the availability of raw materials to manufacture our products  and a disruption in supply could harm our operating results 
we rely on raw materials to manufacture our products  including silicon  various chemicals  gases and compounds 
in particular  we obtain silicon wafers and some packages through limited sources of supply  and in the event of a shortage  we may be forced to locate alternative sources and be forced to pay higher prices 
a severe shortage or an increase in the price of silicon wafers or some packages may harm our gross margins and our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis  if at all 
our business may be adversely effected by acts of terrorism 
acts of terrorism could interrupt or restrict our business in several ways 
we rely extensively on the use of air transportation to move our inventory to and from our vendors and to ship finished products to our customers 
if terrorist acts cause air transportation to be grounded or interrupted  our business would be adversely effected 
in addition  acts of terrorism could cause existing export regulations to be changed  which could limit the extent to which we are allowed to export our products 
to the extent that acts of terrorism also reduce customer confidence and create general economic weakness  our business would also be adversely effected 
our manufacturing operations involve hazardous substances  and the costs of complying with applicable environmental laws could harm our financial results 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air  water and soil 
in the conduct of our manufacturing operations  we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous  toxic or volatile under federal  state and local laws 
the risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated  and if such an accidental release occurs  we could be held financially responsible for clean up costs and other consequences of the release 
in addition  if environmental laws become more stringent over time  or existing laws are more stringently enforced  we could incur greater compliance costs and be subject to increased risks and penalties for violations 
we could be held liable for significant damages for violating environmental laws and could lose certain licenses or permits  which could harm our financial results 
an accident at our manufacturing facility could cause serious damage for which we could be responsible 
our manufacturing operations involve high voltage equipment  explosive gases and hazardous chemicals 
an accident at our manufacturing facility could result in serious personal injury or property damage for which we could be held financially responsible 
any financial obligation in excess of available insurance could harm our financial results 
our charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in the control of our company 
the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of apt 
these and other provisions in our charter may defer hostile takeovers or delay changes in control or management  which could reduce our stock price 
also  there are provisions of delaware law that may have similar effects 
six members of management  as a group  own a significant interest in our common stock 
six members of our senior management own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock  after the issuance of million shares for the acquisition of ghz technology inc as a result  these members of management exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval 
the concentrated holdings of management may result in a delay of  or serve as a deterrent to  possible changes in control of apt  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our cash equivalents  and the high quality and conservative nature of our long term investments  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
currently less than of our revenues are transacted in local currencies  primarily euros 
as a result  our international results of operations have limited exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
most of our export revenues and revenues by apt europe are in us dollars  and most of our foreign currency revenues are from operations with significant expenses in the same currency 
as a result  gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated results of operations
