item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview business and general environment the company  through its subsidiary mortgage guaranty insurance corporation mgic  is the leading provider of private mortgage insurance in the united states to the home mortgage lending industry 
the company s principal products are primary mortgage insurance and pool mortgage insurance 
primary mortgage insurance may be written on a flow basis  in which loans are insured in individual  loan by loan transactions  or may be written on a bulk basis  in which a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single  bulk transaction 
the company s results of operations are affected by premiums earned premiums earned in a year are influenced by 
table of contents cancellations  which reduce the size of the in force book of insurance that generates premiums 
cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book 
new insurance written  which increases the size of the in force book of insurance 
new insurance written is affected by many factors  including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages  including competition from other mortgage insurers and alternatives to mortgage insurance  such as loans 
premium rates  which are affected by the risk characteristics of the loans insured and the percentage of coverage on the loans 
premiums ceded to captive mortgage reinsurers and risk sharing arrangements with the gses 
investment income the investment portfolio is comprised almost entirely of highly rated  fixed income securities 
the principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield 
losses incurred losses incurred are the expense that results from a payment delinquency on an insured loan 
as explained under critical accounting policies below  this expense is recognized only when a loan is delinquent 
losses incurred are generally affected by the state of the economy  which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency 
the product mix of the in force book  with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims 
the average claim payment  which is affected by the size of loans insured higher average loan amounts tend to increase losses incurred  the percentage coverage on insured loans deeper average coverage tends to increase incurred losses  and housing values  which affect the company s ability to mitigate its losses through sales of properties with delinquent mortgages 
the distribution of claims over the life of a book 
historically  the first years after a loan is originated are a period of relatively low claims  with claims increasing substantially for several years after that and then declining  although persistency and the condition of the economy can affect this pattern 

table of contents income from joint ventures joint venture income principally consists of the aggregate results of two less than majority owned joint ventures  credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass and sherman financial group llc sherman 
results the company s results of operations in were principally affected by losses incurred in  compared to  losses incurred increased by million 
this increase was principally the result of a higher number of delinquencies  increases in the estimates regarding how many delinquencies will eventually result in a claim and how much will be paid on claims  as well as an increase of million in net losses paid 
premiums earned during  the company s earned premiums were positively affected by premiums on insurance written through the bulk channel as well as premiums on other products having higher risk characteristics 
during  the company s earned premiums were negatively impacted by unprecedented levels of cancellations of insurance in force  premiums ceded in risk sharing arrangements and a decline in flow market share related to the company s position on certain captive reinsurance arrangements 
income from joint ventures income from joint ventures increased in due to higher contributions from sherman and c bass 
underwriting and operating expenses underwriting and operating expenses increased in as a result of the record volume of business processed  including new insurance written and contract underwriting activity 
investment income during  the investment portfolio increased by million but investment income declined slightly compared to as the increase in the portfolio was offset by a decline in pre tax yield 
results of consolidated operations compared with net income for was million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
diluted earnings per share for was compared with in adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the years ended december  and 
table of contents were million and million  respectively 
as used in this report  the term company means the company and its consolidated subsidiaries  which does not include less than majority owned joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest 
new primary insurance written the amount of new primary insurance written by mgic during was billion  compared to billion in  an increase of billion 
new insurance written on a flow basis increased billion during compared to  with refinance volume increasing over last year 
new insurance written in the bulk channel increased billion during compared to a substantial portion of new insurance written in and covered refinance loans 
consistent with a forecast made in mid february by the mortgage bankers association  which shows a decline in refinance activity in  the company expects new insurance written in to decline 
cancellations and insurance in force the billion of new primary insurance written during was offset by the cancellation of billion of insurance in force  and resulted in a net decrease of billion in primary insurance in force  compared to new primary insurance written of billion  the cancellation of billion of insurance in force and a net increase of billion in primary insurance in force during direct primary insurance in force was billion at december  compared to billion at december  cancellation activity has historically been affected by the level of mortgage interest rates 
cancellations generally move inversely to the change in the direction of interest rates  although they generally lag a change in direction 
mgic s persistency rate percentage of insurance remaining in force from one year prior declined to at december  from at december  if refinance activity declines in from its level in  the company expects that persistency will improve in  although the extent of the improvement is not possible to forecast accurately 
the company is not undertaking any obligation to provide an update of this expectation should it subsequently change 
bulk transactions new insurance written during for bulk transactions was billion billion  billion  billion and billion for the first through fourth quarters  respectively compared to billion during with quarterly volume ranging from billion to billion 
the company s writings of bulk insurance are in part sensitive to the volume of securitization transactions involving non conforming loans 
the company s writings of bulk insurance are also sensitive to competition from other methods of providing credit enhancement in a securitization  including an execution in which the subordinate tranches in the securitization rather than mortgage insurance bear the first loss from mortgage defaults 
competition from such an execution in turn depends on  among other factors  the yield at which investors are willing to purchase tranches of the securitization that involve a higher degree of credit risk compared to the yield for tranches involving the lowest credit risk the difference in such yields is referred to as the spread and the amount of credit for losses that a rating agency will give to 
table of contents mortgage insurance  which may be affected by the agency s view of the outlook for the insurer s claims paying ability 
as the spread declines  competition from an execution in which the subordinate tranches bear the first loss increases 
as a result of the sensitivities discussed above  bulk volume can vary materially from period to period 
the company expects that the loans that are included in bulk transactions will have delinquency and claim rates in excess of those on the company s flow business 
the company also expects that loans included in bulk transactions will have lower persistency than the company s flow business  although the persistency of bulk loans at december and september  was higher than the persistency of flow loans at those dates 
the company believes this is partially the result of the positive effect that pre payment penalties had on bulk loan persistency as well as the historically unprecedented level of cancellations of flow business 
while the company believes it has priced its bulk business to generate acceptable returns  there can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying the premium rates adequately address the risk of this business 
pool insurance in addition to providing primary insurance coverage  the company also insures pools of mortgage loans 
new pool risk written during and was million and million  respectively 
the company s direct pool risk in force was billion at december  and billion at december  the risk amounts are contractual aggregate loss limits and  for the years ended december  and  for billion and billion  respectively  of risk without such limits  risk is calculated at million and million  respectively  for new risk written and million and million  respectively  for risk in force  representing the estimated amount that would credit enhance these loans to a aa level based on a rating agency model 
net premiums written and earned net premiums written and net premiums earned increased in primarily as a result of a higher percentage of premiums on products with higher premium rates  principally on insurance written through the bulk channel 
risk sharing arrangements through september   approximately of the company s new insurance written on a flow basis was subject to captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements or risk sharing arrangements with the gses  this percentage is comparable to the percentage for the year ended december  new insurance written through the bulk channel is not subject to such arrangements 
the percentage of new insurance written during a period covered by such arrangements normally increases after the end of the period because  among other reasons  the transfer of a loan in the secondary market can result in a mortgage insured during a period becoming part of such an arrangement in a subsequent period 
therefore  for  the percentage of new insurance written covered by such arrangements is shown as of the end of the prior quarter 
premiums ceded in such arrangements are reported as ceded in the period in which they are ceded regardless of when the mortgage was insured 

table of contents a substantial portion of the company s captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements is structured on an excess of loss basis 
at the beginning of the second quarter of the company stopped participating in certain excess of loss risk sharing arrangements on terms which are generally present in the market 
the captive mortgage reinsurance programs of larger lenders generally are not consistent with the company s position 
the company s position with respect to such risk sharing arrangements resulted in a reduction of business from such lenders and in a decline in the company s flow market share in compared to investment income investment income in decreased due to a decrease in the average investment yield  offset by an increase in the amortized cost of average invested assets to billion for from billion for  an increase of 
the portfolio s average pre tax investment yield was for and for the portfolio s average after tax investment yield was for and for the company s net realized gains in and resulted primarily from the sale of fixed maturities 
other revenue the increase in other revenue is primarily the result of increased revenue from contract underwriting 
joint ventures the company s equity in the earnings from the sherman and c bass joint ventures with radian group inc radian and certain other joint ventures and investments  accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting  is shown separately  net of tax  on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in income from joint ventures from to is primarily the result of increased equity earnings from sherman and c bass 
c bass  in which the company and radian each have an interest of approximately  is a mortgage investment and servicing firm specializing in credit sensitive single family residential mortgage assets and residential mortgage backed securities 
c bass principally invests in whole loans including subprime loans and mezzanine and subordinated residential mortgage backed securities backed by non conforming residential mortgage loans 
c bass s servicing operations  conducted through its litton loan servicing subsidiary  principally consist of servicing loans on which c bass bears the credit risk 
c bass s principal sources of revenues during the last three years were gains on securitization and liquidation of mortgage related assets  servicing fees and net interest income including accretion on mortgage securities  which revenue items were offset by unrealized losses 
in individual periods the relative contribution of these sources to total revenues has varied 
c bass s results of operations are affected by the timing of its securitization transactions 
virtually all of c bass s assets do not have readily ascertainable market values and  as a result  their value for financial statement purposes is estimated by the management of c bass based on  among other things  valuations provided by financing counterparties 
the ultimate value of these assets is the net present value of their future cash flows  which depends on  among other things  the level of losses on the underlying mortgages and prepayment activity by the mortgage borrowers 
market value adjustments could impact c bass s results of operations and the company s share of those results 

table of contents total assets of c bass at december  and were approximately billion and billion  respectively 
total liabilities at december  and were approximately billion and billion  respectively  of which approximately billion and billion  respectively  was debt  virtually all of which matures within one year or less 
for the years ended december  and  revenues of approximately million and million  respectively  and expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  resulted in income before tax of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s investment in c bass on an equity basis at december  was million 
sherman is principally engaged in the business of purchasing and servicing delinquent consumer assets such as credit card loans and chapter bankruptcy debt 
a substantial portion of sherman s consolidated assets are investments in consumer receivable portfolios that do not have readily ascertainable market values 
sherman s results of operations are sensitive to estimates by sherman s management of ultimate collections on these portfolios 
effective january   the company and radian each sold four percentage points of their respective interest in sherman to sherman s management for cash  reducing each company s interest in sherman to 
the company s investment in sherman on an equity basis at december  was million but is expected to decline at march  due to a distribution received during the first quarter of because c bass and sherman are accounted for by the equity method  they are not consolidated with the company and their assets and liabilities do not appear in the company s balance sheet 
the investments in joint ventures item in the company s balance sheet reflects the amount of capital contributed by the company to the joint ventures plus the company s share of their comprehensive income or minus its share of their comprehensive loss and minus capital distributed to the company by the joint ventures 
losses as discussed in critical accounting policies  consistent with industry practice  loss reserves for future claims are established only for loans that are currently delinquent 
the terms delinquent and default are used interchangeably by the company 
loss reserves are established by management s estimating the number of loans in the company s inventory of delinquent loans that will not cure their delinquency historically  a substantial majority of delinquent loans have cured  which is referred to as the claim rate  and further estimating the amount that the company will pay in claims on the loans that do not cure  which is referred to as claim severity 
estimation of losses that the company will pay in the future is inherently judgmental 
the conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy and the current and future strength of local housing markets 
in net losses incurred were million  million pertained to current year loss development and million pertained to prior years loss development 
on a quarterly basis in  net losses incurred were million  million  million and million 
table of contents for the first through the fourth quarters  respectively 
for the year net losses incurred increased by million 
this increase was principally the result of a higher number of delinquencies both bulk and flow  increases in the estimates regarding how many delinquencies will eventually result in a claim and how much will be paid on claims  as well as an increase of million in net losses paid 
the average primary claim paid for was  compared to  for the company expects that incurred losses in will increase over the level of the company is not undertaking any obligation to provide an update of this expectation should it subsequently change

most a minus and subprime credit loans are written through the bulk channel 
a minus loans have fico credit scores of  as reported to mgic at the time a commitment to insure is issued  and subprime loans have fico credit scores of less than the pool notice inventory increased from  at december  to  at december  information about losses paid in and appears in the table below 

table of contents net paid claims millions twelve months ended december  flow bulk second mortgage pool and other the company has not written any new second mortgage risk for loans closing after at december   of mgic s insurance in force was written subsequent to december  on the company s flow business  the highest claim frequency years have typically been the third through fifth year after the year of loan origination 
however  the pattern of claims frequency can be affected by many factors  including low persistency which can have the effect of accelerating the period in the life of a book during which the highest claim frequency occurs and deteriorating economic conditions which can result in increasing claims following a period of declining claims 
the company expects the period of highest claims frequency on bulk loans will occur earlier than in the historical pattern on the company s flow business 
underwriting and other expenses among other items  the increase in underwriting and other expenses is attributable to increases in expenses related to insurance and contract underwriting activity 
during and the company amortized million and million  respectively  of deferred insurance policy acquisition costs 
see the discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs under critical accounting policies 
the consolidated insurance operations loss ratio was for compared to for the consolidated insurance operations expense and combined ratios were and  respectively  for compared to and for income taxes the effective tax rate was in  compared to in during both periods  the effective tax rate was below the statutory rate of  reflecting the benefits of tax preferenced investments 
the lower effective tax rate in principally resulted from a higher percentage of total income before tax being generated from tax preferenced investments 
the company expects the effective tax rate to be higher in due to reduced benefits from tax preferenced investments

total assets of c bass at december  and were approximately billion and billion  respectively 
total liabilities at december  and were approximately billion and billion  respectively  of which approximately billion and billion  respectively  were debt  virtually all of which matures within one year or less 
the remaining liabilities at those dates were related to interest rate hedging activities or were accrued expenses and other liabilities

table of contents losses net losses incurred increased million in after increasing million in on a quarterly basis  net losses incurred were million  million  million and million for the first through the fourth quarters  respectively 
the increase in was due to an increase in the primary notice inventory related to bulk default activity and defaults arising from the early development of the and flow books of business as well as an increase in losses paid

table of contents other matters under the office of federal housing enterprise oversight s ofheo risk based capital stress test for the gses  claim payments made by a private mortgage insurer on gse loans are reduced below the amount provided by the mortgage insurance policy to reflect the risk that the insurer will fail to pay 
claim payments from an insurer whose claims paying ability rating is aaa are subject to a reduction over the year period of the stress test  while claim payments from a aa rated insurer  such as mgic  are subject to an reduction 
the effect of the differentiation among insurers is to require the gses to have additional capital for coverage on loans provided by a private mortgage insurer whose claims paying rating is less than aaa 
as a result  there is an incentive for the gses to use private mortgage insurance provided by a aaa rated insurer 
in december standard poor s rating services s p announced that it lowered mgic s financial strength rating to aa from aa and the company s long term counterparty credit rating to a from a because of a weakening of mgic s operating performance from a very strong to a strong level  as well as rising delinquencies 
in addition  the level of risk in mgic s book of business is increasing relative to its peers  in part due to the growth in its bulk in force book  which has grown to about of the total in force 
s p said in its announcement that the outlook for mgic s and the company s ratings was stable 
shortly before s p s announcement  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings reaffirmed their respective aa and aa financial strength ratings of mgic 
financial condition as of december   the company had million of short term investments with maturities of days or less  and of the investment portfolio was invested in tax preferenced securities 
in addition  at december   based on book value  the company s fixed income securities were approximately invested in a rated and above  readily marketable securities  concentrated in maturities of less than years 
at december   the company s derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio were immaterial 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in the company s investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
at december   the effective duration of the company s fixed income investment portfolio was years 
this means that for an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points there would be an approximate change in the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and other expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities subject to insurance regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends to the extent funds were required by other than the seller 
substantially all of the investment portfolio securities are held by the company s insurance subsidiaries 

table of contents the company has a million commercial paper program  which is rated a by s p and p by moody s 
at december  and  the company had million and million in commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
the company had a million credit facility available at december  expiring in under the terms of the credit facility  the company must maintain shareholders equity of at least billion and mgic must maintain a risk to capital ratio of not more than and maintain policyholders position which includes mgic s surplus and its contingency reserve of not less than the amount required by wisconsin insurance regulation 
at december   the company met these requirements 
the facility is currently being used as a liquidity back up facility for the outstanding commercial paper 
the remaining credit available under the facility after reduction for the amount necessary to support the commercial paper was million at december  the company had million  senior notes due in and million  senior notes due in outstanding at december  and at december  and  the market value of the outstanding debt was million and million  respectively 
in may  a swap designated as a cash flow hedge was amended to coincide with the credit facility 
under the terms of the swap contract  the company pays a fixed rate of and receives an interest rate based on libor 
the swap has an expiration date coinciding with the maturity of the credit facility and is designated as a cash flow hedge 
the cash flow swap outstanding at december  and is evaluated quarterly using regression analysis with any ineffectiveness being recorded as an expense 
to date this evaluation has not resulted in any hedge ineffectiveness 
swaps are subject to credit risk to the extent the counterparty would be unable to discharge its obligations under the swap agreements 
amortization expense on the interest rate swaps during and of approximately million and million  respectively  were included in interest expense 
gains or losses arising from the amendment or termination of previously held interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the hedged items 
the commercial paper  back up credit facility and the senior notes are obligations of the company and not of its subsidiaries 
the company is a holding company and the payment of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries is restricted by insurance regulation 
mgic is the principal source of dividend paying capacity 
as the result of an extraordinary dividend paid by mgic in march  mgic cannot pay any dividends without the approval of the office of the commissioner of insurance of the state of wisconsin the oci until march  the first paragraph of note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document discusses the regulations of the oci governing the payment of dividends without approval of the oci

the company s principal exposure to loss is its obligation to pay claims under mgic s mortgage guaranty insurance policies 
at december   mgic s direct before any reinsurance primary and pool risk in force which is the unpaid principal balance of insured loans as reflected in the company s records multiplied by the coverage percentage  and taking account of any loss limit was approximately billion 
in addition  as part of its contract underwriting activities  the company is responsible for the quality of its underwriting decisions in accordance with the terms of the contract underwriting agreements with customers 
through december   the cost of remedies provided by the company to customers for failing to meet the standards of the contracts has not been material 
however  the decreasing trend of home mortgage interest rates over the last several years may have mitigated the effect of some of these costs since the general effect of lower interest rates can be to increase the value of certain loans on which remedies are provided 
there can be no assurance that contract underwriting remedies will not be material in the future 
the company s consolidated risk to capital ratio was at december  compared to at december  the decrease was due to an increase in capital of billion  during the risk to capital ratios set forth above have been computed on a statutory basis 
however  the methodology used by the rating agencies to assign claims paying ability ratings permits less leverage than under statutory requirements 
as a result  the amount of capital required under statutory regulations may be lower than the capital required for rating agency purposes 
in addition to capital adequacy  the rating agencies consider other factors in determining a mortgage insurer s claims paying rating  including its historical and projected operating performance  business outlook  competitive position  management and corporate strategy 
see the last paragraph under other matters above for a recent announcement by s p regarding the claims paying ability rating of mgic

critical accounting policies the company believes that the accounting policies described below involved significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
loss reserves reserves are established for reported insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses based on when notices of default on insured mortgage loans are received 
reserves are also established for estimated losses incurred on notices of default not yet reported by the lender 
consistent with industry practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default 
reserves are established by management using estimated claims rates and claims amounts in estimating the ultimate loss 
amounts for salvage recoverable are considered in the determination of the reserve estimates 
adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the years in which the adjustments are made 
the liability for reinsurance assumed is based on information provided by the ceding companies 
the incurred but not reported ibnr reserves referred to above result from defaults occurring prior to the close of an accounting period  but which have not been reported to the company by the lender 
consistent with reserves for reported defaults  ibnr reserves are established using estimated claims rates and claims amounts for the estimated number of defaults not reported 
reserves also provide for the estimated costs of settling claims  including legal and other expenses and general expenses of administering the claims settlement process 
revenue recognition when the policy term ends  the primary mortgage insurance written by the company is renewable at the insured s option through continued payment of the premium in accordance with the schedule established at the inception of the policy term 
the company has no ability to 
table of contents reunderwrite or reprice these policies after issuance 
premiums written under policies having single and annual premium payments are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy term 
premiums written on policies covering more than one year are amortized over the policy life in accordance with the expiration of risk which is the anticipated claim payment pattern based on historical experience 
premiums written on annual policies are earned on a monthly pro rata basis 
premiums written on monthly policies are earned as the monthly coverage is provided 
fee income of the non insurance subsidiaries is earned and recognized as the services are provided and the customer is obligated to pay 
deferred insurance policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance policies  consisting of employee compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred insurance policy acquisition costs dac 
dac arising from each book of business is charged against revenue in the same proportion that the underwriting profit for the period of the charge bears to the total underwriting profit over the life of the policies 
the underwriting profit and the life of the policies are estimated and are reviewed quarterly and updated when necessary to reflect actual experience and any changes to key assumptions such as loss development

risk factors the company s revenues and losses could be affected by the risk factors discussed below  which are an integral part of management s discussion and analysis 
these factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements that the company may make 
forward looking statements consist of statements which relate to matters other than historical fact 
among others  statements that include words such as the company believes  anticipates or expects  or words of similar import  are forward looking statements 
the company is not undertaking any obligation to update any forward looking statements in this management s discussion and analysis 
as the domestic economy deteriorates  more homeowners may default and the company s losses may increase 
losses result from events that reduce a borrower s ability to continue to make mortgage payments  such as unemployment  and whether the home of a borrower who defaults on his mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale 
favorable economic conditions generally reduce the likelihood that borrowers will lack sufficient income to pay their mortgages and also favorably affect the value of homes  thereby reducing and in some cases even eliminating a loss from a mortgage default 
a deterioration in economic conditions generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages and can also adversely affect housing values 
the mix of business the company writes also affects the likelihood of losses occurring 
in recent years  a greater percentage of the company s volume than in the past has included segments that the company views as having a higher probability of claim  including loans with ltv ratios over  fico credit scores below or limited underwriting  including limited 
table of contents borrower documentation 
a mid february mortgage finance forecast of the mortgage bankers association projects that quarterly mortgage originations in the united states are expected to decline materially in compared to in response to lower national origination volume  mortgage lenders may seek to maintain their own volume through a greater focus on lending to borrowers in segments that the company views as having a higher probability of claim 
about of the company s risk in force written through the flow channel  and somewhat more than half of the company s risk in force written through the bulk channel  consists of arms 
the company believes that during a prolonged period of rising interest rates claims on arms would be substantially higher than for fixed rate loans  although the performance of arms has not been tested in such an environment 
the performance of the servicing function on a mortgage loan  particularly a subprime loan  can affect the likelihood that the loan will default as well as the loss resulting from a default 
the company believes fairbanks capital corp 
fairbanks is the servicer of approximately of the loans insured by the company and approximately of the loans insured by the company written through the bulk channel a substantial number of which are subprime 
the servicer ratings assigned to fairbanks by moody s and s p were downgraded during the second quarter of from strong to below average or their equivalents due in part to concerns expressed by those rating agencies about fairbanks regulatory compliance and operational controls 
competition or changes in the company s relationships with its customers could reduce the company s revenues or increase its losses 
competition for private mortgage insurance premiums occurs not only among private mortgage insurers but also with mortgage lenders through captive mortgage reinsurance transactions 
in these transactions  a lender s affiliate reinsures a portion of the insurance written by a private mortgage insurer on mortgages originated or serviced by the lender 
a substantial portion of the company s captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements are structured on an excess of loss basis 
at the beginning of the second quarter of the company stopped participating in certain excess of loss risk sharing arrangements on terms which are generally present in the market 
the captive mortgage reinsurance programs of larger lenders generally are not consistent with the company s position 
the company s position with respect to such risk sharing arrangements resulted in a reduction of business from such lenders and a decline in the company s flow market share in compared to the level of competition within the private mortgage insurance industry has also increased as many large mortgage lenders have reduced the number of private mortgage insurers with whom they do business 
at the same time  consolidation among mortgage lenders has increased the share of the mortgage lending market held by large lenders 
the company s top ten customers generated of the new primary insurance that it wrote on a flow basis in compared to in and in the share of company s top ten customers declined in as a result of the company s position on captive mortgage reinsurance referred to above

if interest rates decline  house prices appreciate or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements change  the length of time that our policies remain in force could decline and result in declines in our revenue 
in each year  most of the company s premiums are from insurance that has been written in prior years 
as a result  the length of time insurance remains in force which is also generally referred to as persistency is an important determinant of revenues 
the factors affecting the length of time the company s insurance remains in force include the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates on the insurance in force  which affects the vulnerability of the insurance in force to refinancings  and mortgage insurance cancellation policies of mortgage investors along with the rate of home price appreciation experienced by the homes underlying the mortgages in the insurance in force 
during the s  the company s year end persistency ranged from a high of at december  to a low of at december  at december  persistency was at 
over the past several years  refinancing has become easier to accomplish and less costly for many consumers 
hence  even in an interest rate environment favorable to persistency improvement  the company does not expect persistency will approach its december  level 
if the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations declines  the amount of insurance that the company writes could decline which would reduce the company s revenues 
the factors that affect the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include the level of home mortgage interest rates  the health of the domestic economy as well as conditions in regional and local economies

in general  the majority of the underwriting profit premium revenue minus losses that a book of mortgage insurance generates occurs in the early years of the book  with the largest portion of the underwriting profit realized in the first year 
subsequent years of a book generally result in modest underwriting profit or underwriting losses 
this pattern of results occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience occur in the first few years of the book  when premium revenue is highest  while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues  as persistency decreases due to loan prepayments  and higher losses 
if all other things were equal  a decline in new insurance written in a year that followed a number of years of higher volume could result in a lower contribution to the mortgage insurer s overall results 
this effect may occur because the older books will be experiencing declines in revenue and increases in losses with a lower amount of underwriting profit on the new book available to offset these results 
whether such a lower contribution would in fact occur depends in part on the extent of the volume decline 
even with a substantial decline in volume  there may be offsetting factors that could increase the contribution in the current year 
these offsetting factors include higher persistency and a mix of business with higher average premiums  which could have the effect of increasing revenues  and improvements in the economy  which could have the effect of reducing losses 
in addition  the effect on the insurer s overall results from such a lower contribution may be offset by decreases in the mortgage insurer s expenses that are unrelated to claim or default activity  including those related to lower volume 
the company s new insurance written during was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
consistent with a mid february mortgage finance forecast of the mortgage bankers association  which projects that quarterly mortgage originations in the united states are expected to decline materially in compared to  the company expects new insurance written in will be materially lower than in the amount of insurance the company writes could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance 
these alternatives to private mortgage insurance include lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  such as a first mortgage with an loan to value ratio and a second mortgage with a loan to value 
table of contents ratio referred to as an loan rather than a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio  investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self insuring  investors using credit enhancements other than private mortgage insurance or using other credit enhancements in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage  and lenders using government mortgage insurance programs  including those of the federal housing administration and the veterans administration 
while no data is publicly available  the company believes that loans remain a significant percentage of mortgage originations 
changes in the business practices of fannie mae and freddie mac could reduce the company s revenues or increase its losses 
the business practices of fannie mae and freddie mac affect the entire relationship between them and mortgage insurers and include the level of private mortgage insurance coverage  subject to the limitations of fannie mae and freddie mac s charters  when private mortgage insurance is used as the required credit enhancement on low down payment mortgages  whether fannie mae or freddie mac influence the mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage and  if so  any transactions that are related to that selection  whether fannie mae or freddie mac will give mortgage lenders an incentive  such as a reduced guaranty fee  to select a mortgage insurer that has a aaa claims paying ability rating to benefit from the lower capital requirements for fannie mae and freddie mac when a mortgage is insured by a company with that rating  the underwriting standards that determine what loans are eligible for purchase by fannie mae or freddie mac  which thereby affect the quality of the risk insured by the mortgage insurer and the availability of mortgage loans  the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage can be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law  and the circumstances in which mortgage servicers must perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are delinquent 

table of contents the mortgage insurance industry is subject to litigation risk 
consumers are bringing a growing number of lawsuits against home mortgage lenders and settlement service providers 
in recent years  seven mortgage insurers  including the company s mgic subsidiary  have been involved in litigation alleging violations of the real estate settlement procedures act  which is commonly known as respa 
mgic s settlement of litigation against it under respa became final in october there can be no assurance that mgic will not be subject to future litigation under respa 
in march an action against mgic was filed in federal district court in orlando  florida seeking certification of a nationwide class of consumers who were required to pay for private mortgage insurance written by mgic and whose loans were insured at less than mgic s best available rate based on credit scores obtained by mgic 
a portion of mgic s a minus and subprime premium rates are based in part on the credit score of the borrower 
the action alleges that the federal fair credit reporting act fcra requires a notice to borrowers of such adverse action and that mgic has violated fcra by failing to give such notice 
the action seeks statutory damages which in the case of willful violations  in addition to punitive damages  may be awarded in an amount of to  per class member and or actual damages of the persons in the class  and attorneys fees  as well as declaratory and injunctive relief 
the action also alleges that the failure to give notice to borrowers in florida in the circumstances alleged is a violation of florida s unfair and deceptive acts and practices act and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief for such violation 
in december  the court denied mgic s motion seeking dismissal of the portion of the case covering damages under fcra but dismissed the remainder of the case 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of the litigation will not materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
similar actions have been filed against five other mortgage insurers 
net premiums written could be adversely affected if a proposed regulation by the department of housing and urban development under the real estate settlement procedures act is adopted 
the regulations of the department of housing and urban development under the real estate settlement procedures act prohibit paying lenders for the referral of settlement services  including mortgage insurance  and prohibit lenders from receiving such payments 
in july  the department of housing and urban development proposed a regulation that would exclude from these anti referral fee provisions settlement services included in a package of settlement services offered to a borrower at a guaranteed price 
if mortgage insurance is required on a loan  the package must include any mortgage insurance premium paid at settlement 
although certain state insurance regulations prohibit an insurer s payment of referral fees  adoption of this regulation by the department of housing and urban development could adversely affect the company s revenues to the extent that lenders offered such packages and received value from the company in excess of what they could have received were the anti referral fee provisions of the real estate settlement procedures act to apply and if such state regulations were not applied to prohibit such payments
