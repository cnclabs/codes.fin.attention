overview of business water pik technologies is a leader in designing  manufacturing and marketing a broad range of well recognized personal health care products  swimming pool products and water heating systems 
we operate in two business segments the personal health care segment and the pool products and heating systems segment 
the personal health care segment designs  manufactures and markets personal health care products including showerheads  consumer and professional oral health products  water filtration products and personal stress relief products 
our personal health care products are sold through a variety of channels  including home centers  mass merchandisers  drug chains and specialty retailers 
the pool products and heating systems segment designs  manufactures and markets swimming pool and spa heaters  heat pumps  electronic controls  valves  pumps  filters  automatic salt chlorine generators  water features and residential and commercial water heating systems 
our pool products and water heating systems are sold through contractors and wholesale distributors 
our strategy is to achieve sales and leveraged earnings growth through new product introductions and acquisitions that complement our existing businesses 
we are focusing our investments and resources for the personal health care segment on distribution gains and retail sell through programs for products launched over the past several years 
we continue to pursue product innovations to support future growth 
the focus for our pool products and heating systems segment is a targeted pool builder conversion program marketing the jandy system  our comprehensive line of swimming pool and spa products designed to meet all the equipment needs of our customers 
we have enhanced our jandy product offering through internal development  as well as strategic acquisitions 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets of air energy heat pumps  inc and affiliates air energy  a privately held manufacturing company located in ft 
lauderdale  florida 
air energy manufactures premium heat pumps for swimming pools and spas 
the addition of heat pumps to our product line gives us a significant market position in regions of the country where heat pumps are the preferred technology to heat pools and spas 
in january  we completed the acquisition of huron tech systems  a manufacturer of salt chlorine generators used for swimming pool and spa water sanitation 
the addition of the clormatic salt chlorine generator product line will integrate a high growth pool equipment category into the jandy system 
in addition  huron tech systems manufactures titanium heat exchangers  which are used in our heat pump product line 
the vertical integration is expected to result in margin improvement in the product line 
over the past several years  we have made the necessary investments in products  infrastructure and human resources  and implemented cost reduction programs to position us well for continued sales and earnings growth 
we have developed high quality  lower cost manufacturing capabilities and streamlined our operations by eliminating redundant manufacturing facilities and moving manufacturing to lower cost facilities offshore 
we have improved our retail customer relationships with higher service levels and our pool contractors and wholesale distributor relationships with enhanced product offerings 
management uses certain key financial and non financial indicators in managing the business including customer order backlog  sales and sell through  new products as a percent of sales  gross margin  cost of quality including warranty  rework  and scrap  on time delivery  cost reductions  production cost increases 
in december  we formalized a plan to dispose of our ozone product line  a component of the personal health care segment 
the ozone product line includes the aquia home sanitizing product introduced in september we have decided that the promotional investment necessary to create the market for consumer products based on this technology is significantly greater than the available resources 
we are actively pursuing the sale of the ozone product line and expect that disposition will be completed in fiscal year the operating results of the discontinued product line have been reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and the assets and liabilities have been reclassified to other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
all discussions and amounts herein for all years presented relate water pik technologies  inc to continuing operations only unless otherwise noted 
the discussions related to prior years have been modified to reflect information on continuing operations only 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses water pik technologies consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including promotions  cooperative advertising programs and other volume based incentives 
should the costs under these customer programs and incentive offerings exceed those estimated  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
we also allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
we record an allowance for estimated returns  based on historical experience  at the time of sale 
should the actual returns exceed those estimated  additional reductions to revenue and cost of sales may be required 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states and canada 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
additionally  we offer extended payment terms to pool products customers to encourage them to purchase products generally during the fourth quarter to better enable utilization of manufacturing capacity 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we also insure selected high risk receivables from time to time to reduce our risk of credit loss 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers  including scp pool corporation  which accounted for approximately percent and percent of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively  were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory last in  first out lifo and first in first out fifo cost methods or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
this can occur if there is a decline in demand for our existing products or if the market does not accept our new or enhanced products 
market acceptance of new products is regularly evaluated after product launch 
generally  following introduction of a new product  we allow months  depending on the product category  before writing down the inventory as obsolete or unmarketable 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties  based on historical experience and any identified product quality issues  at the time revenue is recognized 
while we have comprehensive product quality programs and processes  including extensive testing during the new product development process and active monitoring and evaluation of our component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability and an increase in warranty expense may be required 
water pik technologies  inc deferred income taxes we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets as we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are determined using a combination of accelerated and straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes 
we estimate the useful lives of property  plant and equipment based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
should the actual useful lives be less than those estimated  additional depreciation expense may be required 
long lived assets impairment we currently evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors  including the discount rate used  to calculate the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance reserves and legal contingencies we record loss accruals to cover the portion of general liability  product liability and workers compensation  both asserted claims and incurred but not reported claims  not covered by insurance policies 
such accruals are estimated based on information provided by our insurance company  claims adjusters and insurance broker  taking into account prior experience  numbers of claims  discussions with legal counsel and other relevant factors 
should the number of claims or the actual outcome of any claim result in losses in excess of amounts accrued  an adjustment to the loss accruals and increase in expense may be required

financial condition and liquidity our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures and to meet required debt payments 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under the credit facilities described below  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures and make scheduled water pik technologies  inc principal and interest payments on our debt obligations for at least the next months 
however  a decrease in demand for our products due to risk factors discussed in part i of this report or deterioration in our financial ratios under our credit facilities could adversely affect our liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities of  related to continuing operations and  in increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility were used to fund  of the air energy acquisition  to fund capital expenditures of  and to make scheduled payments on promissory notes of  cash decreased  to  at december  from  at december  net cash provided by operations in results primarily from net income adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization expense and to an increase in accrued income taxes 
accrued income taxes increased due primarily to higher taxable income in as compared to this was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increases at both segments due to higher fourth quarter sales in as compared to including sales under seasonal selling programs in the pool products and heating systems segment with extended payment terms 
the increase in inventory is due primarily to new product inventory in the pool products and heating systems segment including pool product s new pump and filter and heat pump lines 
in  cash provided by operating activities of  and proceeds of  from the issuance of promissory notes under our equipment financing facility were used to fund capital expenditures of  to repay borrowings under revolving credit facilities of  and to make scheduled payments on promissory notes of  working capital increased to  at december  from  at december  the current ratio increased to at december  from at december  the increase in working capital is due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories as discussed above 
we have general liability  product liability and workers compensation insurance programs 
insurance coverage under these programs is subject to policy deductibles for which we are at risk for losses 
the actual settlements or other resolution of claims under these insurance programs may differ from estimated reserves  but the possible range of loss in excess of those accrued is not reasonably estimable 
based upon currently available information  we do not believe that resolution of any pending insurance claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period and ultimately could affect our insurance premiums or our ability to obtain insurance coverage 
on august   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of banks for a revolving bank credit facility of up to  including  revolving credit availability for our canadian subsidiary 
borrowings under the facility are limited to borrowing base calculations based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to the borrowing base less the outstanding line of credit  not to exceed  the credit facility expires on december  and replaced our previous  revolving credit facility  which was due to expire in november  and our cdn 
 canadian revolving credit facility 
at december   there were  in borrowings and  in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility with  in borrowing availability remaining under borrowing base limitations of the credit facility 
on october   we entered into a real estate financing agreement with a bank and mortgaged our four us manufacturing facilities to secure four promissory notes totaling  the notes require monthly payments of approximately  plus accrued interest through august with a final principal payment of  and accrued interest due on september  in august  we voluntarily amended the real estate financing agreement to conform certain financial covenants to those in the amended and restated revolving credit facility 
the balance outstanding at december  was  on december   we entered into a  equipment financing agreement with a bank 
initial borrowings under the agreement of  were funded on december  and are evidenced by two term notes secured by specific machinery and equipment located at our manufacturing facilities 
the notes require quarterly payments of  plus accrued interest beginning on april  with all unpaid principal balances and accrued interest due on january  in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the variable rate interest on the  promissory notes payable to a fixed rate of percent 
the interest rate swap expires on january  interest differentials to be paid or received because of the swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the related period that the debt is outstanding 
on september   we borrowed an additional  under the equipment financing agreement evidenced by two variable rate term notes secured by specific machinery and equipment located at our manufacturing facilities and at certain vendors facilities 
the notes require water pik technologies  inc quarterly payments of  beginning on december  with all unpaid principal balances and accrued interest due on september  the balance outstanding under this agreement at december  was  no additional amounts can be borrowed under this agreement 
our revolving credit facility and mortgage notes require us to comply with various financial covenants and restrictions  including covenants and restrictions relating to indebtedness  liens  investments  dividends  fixed charge coverage  capital expenditures and the relationship of our total consolidated indebtedness to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
a security interest in substantially all of our assets was granted as collateral to the lenders under the credit agreements 
to the extent that we are not able to comply with the financial covenants  we may be unable to borrow additional amounts and outstanding amounts may become due on an accelerated basis  which would adversely affect our liquidity 
due to the seasonality of our pool products business  the extended payment term receivables offered during the winter months are collected during the spring and summer 
this creates a seasonal peak in borrowing levels during the spring months 
we currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on our common stock in order to conserve cash to fund our future operations and growth 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility limit the amount of cash dividends that we may pay 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities 
contractual obligations the following represents contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payments due or commitment expiration by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt     capital lease obligations operating leases    purchase obligations   other long term liabilities    total contractual obligations    other commercial commitments standby letters of credit purchase obligations include contracts made in the ordinary course of business related to raw material purchases and legally binding commitments for capital projects 
purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
other long term liabilities represent other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets with known payment streams and include worker s compensation and product and general liability reserves and balances under the water pik technologies  inc deferred compensation plan 
amounts do not include the fair market value of derivative financial instruments 
the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management s estimates 
standby letter of credit balances are related to merchandise purchases from foreign vendors 
in addition  we have  in standby letters of credit as a collateral requirement of our insurance carrier for our projected exposure for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have an accrued liability for the estimated claims  both reported and incurred but not reported  which is included in the other long term liabilities amounts above

inflation inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which we operate and has not had a material impact upon our results of operations for the periods discussed above 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risk associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
changes in exchange rates  including those resulting from foreign government actions related to local currencies  may affect the cost of products the company purchases from international locations such as china 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations  primarily in canadian dollars and japanese yen  into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
such translation resulted in unrealized gains of  in and  in and an unrealized loss of  in we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe they are justified by the exposure or the cost 
the change in currency exchange rates for the canadian dollar would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit 
we estimate that a percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit 
we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  we do not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk we have borrowings outstanding of  at december   which bear interest at variable rates and  therefore  changes in interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon to the extent such variable interest rate is not hedged 
the variable rate borrowings include our line of credit  the mortgages on our domestic facilities and the promissory notes issued under our equipment financing facility 
domestic borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at varying rates at either the greater of the bank s prime rate  percent above the base cd certificates of deposit rate  or percent above the federal funds effective rate  plus a margin of to basis points or  if we exercise a libor london interbank offered rate option  at the libor rate plus a margin of to basis points per annum 
for borrowings by our canadian subsidiary  us dollar denominated borrowings bear interest at either the greater of the canadian bank s us base prime rate or percent above the federal funds effective rate  plus a margin of to basis points 
canadian dollar borrowings bear interest at the greater of the bank s canadian primer rate of percent above the cdor canadian dollar offered rate  plus a margin of to basis points per annum 
a letter of credit fee is charged to the company equal to the libor rate less basis points on the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit 
the company also is subject to a fronting fee equal to percent per annum of outstanding letters of credit 
the mortgage notes bear interest at libor plus to basis points 
the promissory notes under the equipment financing facility bear interest at libor plus basis points 
in order to mitigate a portion of the market risk on our variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with a financial institution on january  under terms of these separate contracts we receive a libor based variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate of percent on the contracts on notional amounts totaling  at december  that mature in january we estimate that a percent change in interest rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit
