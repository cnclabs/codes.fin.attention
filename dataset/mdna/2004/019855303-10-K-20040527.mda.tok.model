executive summary and outlook fiscal was a transitional year for us 
as was the case in prior years  we completed several acquisitions in fiscal  however  our acquisition of delia s corp 
in september was unique 
not only was it our first acquisition of a business with retail stores  but it was also our first acquisition of a business that was losing significant amounts of money 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to close the catalog operations of our girlfriends la and old glory brands  both of which we acquired in fiscal  in order to focus on our core direct marketing brands delia s and alloy for girls  and ccs and dan s comp for boys 
we also made the decision to reduce the number of catalogs we mailed in fiscal in an effort to focus circulation on the more productive names in the database to drive more profitable direct marketing segment operations 
although we expected revenues of alloy s catalog titles to be lower as a result of this decision  we did not expect the sharp year over year decline in response rates we experienced for catalogs mailed during the second half of the year 
we attribute the response rate decline primarily to merchandise selections that did not receive expected levels of customer demand 
the result of reduced catalog circulation and lower response rates was a significant drop in revenues of our direct marketing segment in alloy s legacy titles  which was partially offset by the sales generated by delia s direct marketing operations after the acquisition 
primarily as a result of the write down of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in our direct marketing segment  which resulted from our annual evaluation of segment goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  along with the write down of trademarks in our sponsorship and other segment  the losses associated with the acquired delia s operations  the performance downturn in our other catalog titles  and increased corporate expenses due to our enlarged business and costs we faced as a result of increased litigation and our internal investigation  we transitioned from income from operations of million in fiscal to a loss from operations in fiscal of million 
although our financial performance declined materially in fiscal  and we are still evaluating delia s overall operations  in particular its retail stores  we believe that the synergies we expect to result from combining operations and leveraging our scale  selling across our combined databases while controlling the absolute number of catalogs mailed  and moving the majority of our fulfillment operations in house by making use of delia s warehouse and fulfillment operations in hanover  pennsylvania should begin to be demonstrated in fiscal we believe that our available cash and marketable investments aggregating approximately million at january  and other working capital and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
at the end of fiscal  we had working capital of million  which included unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
this compares with working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at the end of fiscal the primary reasons for these decreases are our repayment of acquired company debt  our capital expenditures  our repurchase of common stock and our cash used for corporate acquisitions in fiscal  which was partially offset by our sale of million of our debentures see liquidity and capital resources 
since september  we have focused significant attention on evaluating and improving the acquired delia s operations 
as part of that evaluation  management has completed its assessment and estimated store exit  lease costs  and severance related to under performing delia s retail stores 
we also continue to evaluate our legacy direct marketing businesses and continue to review the expansion of our sponsorship and other businesses 
after the addition of our new chief executive officer of our retail and direct consumer division who joined in october  a number of key management changes have been made in strategic areas to establish the creative  buying and planning teams necessary to execute the successful selection and presentation of merchandise to gain consumer acceptance 
we have also added a number of individuals in our sponsorship divisions as a result of acquisitions and other hires 
we believe that these individuals are highly qualified for the positions for which they were hired and bring with them extensive cross functional 
table of contents management skills 
we also plan to remain focused in our previously announced efforts to separate our media and merchandising businesses at an opportune time in the foreseeable future 
we believe that the benefits of these strategic efforts will begin to be seen with our customers during fiscal finally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our audit committee  with the assistance of the law firm mayer  brown  rowe maw  llp and the forensic accounting firm huron consulting group llc  conducted an investigation into the allegations of accounting irregularities raised in the consolidated class action complaint filed against alloy in august and the derivative action filed in october we are pleased to report that the investigation did not result in the substantiation of any of the allegations 
unfortunately  the costs of the investigation were quite high  and were a contributing factor to our fiscal operating loss 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses  among other things  our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe  however  the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition direct marketing revenues are recognized at the time products are shipped to customers  net of any promotional price discounts and an allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based upon our return policy  historical experience and evaluation of current sales and returns trends 
merchandise revenues also include shipping and handling billed to customers 
shipping and handling costs are reflected in selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and approximated million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale  net of any promotional price discounts and an allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based upon our return policy  historical experience and evaluation of current sales and returns trends 
sponsorship revenues consist primarily of advertising provided for third parties in our media properties or via marketing events or programs we execute on the advertiser s behalf 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized  net of the commissions and agency fees  when the underlying advertisement is published  broadcasted or otherwise delivered pursuant to the terms of each arrangement 
delivery of advertising in other media forms is completed either in the form of the display of an impression or based upon the provision of 
table of contents contracted services in connection with the marketing event or program 
in catalog print advertising revenues are recognized as earned pro rata on a monthly basis over the estimated economic life of the catalog 
billings in advance of advertising delivery are deferred until earned 
other revenues consist of book development publishing revenue and other service contracts 
publishing revenues are recognized upon publication of each property 
service revenues are recognized as the contracted services are rendered 
in our advertising placement activities  an analysis of our pricing and collection risk  among other tests  is made to determine whether revenue is reported on a gross or net basis 
catalog costs catalog costs consist of catalog production and mailing costs 
catalog costs are capitalized and charged to expense over the expected future revenue stream  which is principally three to four months from the date the catalogs are mailed 
an estimate of the future sales dollars to be generated from each individual catalog drop is used in our catalog costs policy 
the estimate of future sales is calculated for each catalog drop using historical trends for similar catalog drops mailed in prior periods as well as the overall current sales trend for the catalog brand 
this estimate is compared with the actual sales generated to date for the catalog drop to determine the percentage of total catalog costs to be classified as prepaid on our consolidated balance sheets 
prepaid catalog costs on the consolidated balance sheets and selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income are affected by these estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon our forecasted plans to sell our inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the amounts that we may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions  trends  or competitive conditions differ from our estimates and expectations 
these estimates affect the balance of inventory on our consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to customer credit issues and bankruptcies 
we provide reserves for these situations based on the evaluation of the aging of our accounts receivable portfolio and a customer by customer analysis of our high risk customers 
our reserves contemplate our historical write offs on receivables  specific customer situations  and the economic environments in which we operate 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and is dependent upon the overall economic environment and our customer viability 
these estimates affect the balance of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets and selling and marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  was being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future periods to be benefited  ranging from three to five years 
effective february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 which eliminates amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  and requires these assets to be subject to annual impairments tests 
intangible assets consist of trademarks  mailing lists  customer relationships  noncompetition agreements  websites and marketing rights acquired in connection with our business acquisitions 
trademarks currently have indefinite lives  however  the other identified intangible assets are amortized over their expected benefit periods  ranging from two to eight years 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is designed to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit generally  our reportable segments with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
using these methods  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we completed our annual impairment review and recorded a million charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in our direct marketing segment and an approximate million and charge to reduce the carrying value of other indefinite lived intangible assets in our direct marketing segment and sponsorship and other segment  respectively 
the combined million charge is reflected as a component of operating income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units which may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the economic environment in which we operate 
these estimates affect the balance of goodwill and intangible and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which the company adopted in  long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the 
table of contents carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company performed an analysis of the recoverability of certain long lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the direct marketing segment 
we determined that the carrying amounts of the non competition agreement of  related to old glory  the website of  related to old glory and the non competition agreement of  related to girlfriends la were impaired as we plan to discontinue marketing our old glory and girlfriends la brands 
other assets of these businesses  namely mailing lists  were not deemed impaired as they are and can be used by other parts of our direct marketing segment 
in addition  the future cash flows related to dan s comp could not fully support the carrying amount of dan s comp s long lived assets 
as a result  an impairment charge related to the non competition agreement of  property and equipment of  and mailing list of  was recorded

total revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal direct marketing revenues 
direct marketing revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal revenue from our alloy  girlfriends la  ccs  and dan s comp brands decreased as a result of both a planned decline in catalog circulation following our acquisition of delia s and lower customer response rates to the catalogs we did mail during the second half of the fiscal year due to less desirable merchandise assortments 
we acquired delia s in september primarily to improve catalog circulation productivity by overlaying similar name databases  add a strong  teen focused brand  and capitalize on cost saving opportunities in combining the businesses 
delia s direct marketing revenue from september through the end of fiscal totaled million  which partially offset the decreased sales in our other brands 
retail stores revenues 
retail stores revenues totaled million for fiscal compared with none for fiscal the retail stores revenue was generated solely from delia s retail stores 
we owned no retail stores prior to our acquisition of delia s in september sponsorship and other activities revenues 
sponsorship and other activities revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was the result of three main factors the addition of on campus marketing s ocm revenue from the date of its acquisition in may  the twelve months of revenue from market place media mpm during fiscal compared with the five and one half months of revenue from mpm during fiscal  and our expanding client base and our strengthened client relationships within our promotional marketing business units 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of the cost of the merchandise sold plus the freight cost to deliver the merchandise to the warehouse and retail stores  together with the direct costs attributable to the sponsorship and advertising programs we provide and the marketing publications we produce 
our cost of revenues increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to the additional costs of goods sold by ocm acquired in may  a full year s cost of revenues for our mpm ad placement business  and the cost of merchandise sold by delia s acquired in september  offset partially by decreases in cost of goods sold related to the revenue declines of the alloy  girlfriends la  ccs and dan s comp direct marketing brands 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the lower gross margin profile of our sponsorship and other revenues as an increased proportion of these revenues were generated from our lower gross margin advertising placement and event and field marketing activities 
in addition  gross margins within our sponsorship business units declined due to more competitive market conditions in fiscal  which required us to reduce our margins to win sponsorship business contracts 
gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods due primarily to the changing revenue contributions of our different sponsorship activities 
total operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of our catalog production and mailing costs  our call centers and fulfillment operations expenses  delia s retail store costs  freight costs to deliver goods to our merchandise customers  compensation of our sales and marketing personnel  marketing costs  and information technology expenses related to the maintenance and marketing of our websites and support for our advertising sales activities 
these selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of delia s selling and marketing expenses since september the inclusion of ocm s selling and marketing expenses since its acquisition in may  increased information technology spending to support our expanded advertising sales force  increased occupancy expenses of our expanded advertising sales and execution staff  and the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel 
as a percentage of total revenues  our selling and marketing expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to reduced catalog productivity revenues per book circulated and the high selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues of delia s unprofitable retail store operations 
fulfillment expenses  including credit card processing charges  decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to decreased revenues in the direct marketing segment and delia s more efficient in house fulfillment operations 
we expect fulfillment expenses to decrease further in fiscal as we transition all of our fulfillment operations for our alloy and ccs units from new roads to our delia s in house fulfillment operations 
as a percentage of net direct marketing revenues  fulfillment expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative  finance and management personnel  as well as support services and professional service fees 
these expenses increased to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily was driven by the addition of ocm s expenses since the acquisition date  
table of contents the inclusion of delia s expenses since september   the acquisition date  an increase in compensation expense for additional personnel to handle our growing business  the costs of our audit committee s investigation into the alleged accounting irregularities  and increased expenses associated with growing a public company such as professional fees  insurance premiums  occupancy costs due to office expansions  and telecommunications costs 
our general and administrative expenses increased to as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to the addition of high general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in the acquired delia s business 
we expect general and administrative expenses to grow as we hire additional personnel and incur additional expenses related to the growth of our business and our operations 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal as compared with million for fiscal in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires an annual impairment review of such assets 
the increase in intangible asset amortization is due to our acquisition activities during the last twelve months and the associated allocation of purchase price to amortizable identified intangible assets 
all of our acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
due to the decline in catalog response rates  operating profit and cash flows were lower than expected during fiscal based on that trend  as well as the addition and integration of delia s  the projected cash flows could not support the goodwill within the direct marketing reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized since the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  an impairment charge for trademarks of million and million was recognized in the direct marketing segment and the sponsorship and other segment  respectively 
in the direct marketing segment  the trademark impairment charge of million was recognized since the carrying value of the reporting unit s trademarks was greater than the fair value of the reporting unit s trademarks 
in the sponsorship and other segment  an impairment charge of million was recorded since the carrying value of the reporting unit s trademarks was greater than the fair value of the reporting units trademarks and an additional impairment charge was recognized due to the discontinued use of certain trademarks 
impairment of other long lived assets 
as a result of triggering events such as the planned discontinuance of the old glory and girlfriends la catalog brands  we performed an analysis pursuant to sfas no 
of the recoverability of long lived assets in the direct marketing segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of this analysis  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the direct marketing segment 
alloy determined that the carrying amounts of the non competition agreement of  related to old glory  the website of  related to old glory and the non competition agreement of  related to girlfriends la were impaired as we plan to discontinue marketing our old glory and girlfriends la brands 
in addition  the future cash flows related to dan s comp could not fully support the carrying amount of dan s comp s long lived assets 
as a result  an impairment charge related to the non competition agreement of  property and equipment of  and mailing list of  was recorded 
restructuring charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we made the strategic decision to outsource substantially all of our fulfillment activities for our girlfriends la unit to new roads 
we determined that we would not be able to sublease our existing fulfillment facilities due to real estate market conditions 
as a result  and in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we recognized a first quarter charge of approximately  in our direct marketing segment  representing the future contractual lease payments  severance and personnel costs  and the write off of related leasehold improvements 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we made the strategic decision to transfer substantially all of our call center and fulfillment activities for our alloy and ccs units from new roads  a third party service provider  to our 
table of contents recently acquired distribution center in hanover  pennsylvania and call center in westerville  ohio 
as a result  we were required to pay new roads an exit fee 
we recognized a charge of approximately  in the third quarter of in our direct marketing segment  representing the contractual exit payment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off an abandoned facility lease and equipment no longer required in our business operations when we determined that we could not exit the lease or sublease the space 
as a result  we took a fourth quarter charge of million 
we will continue to review our operations to determine the necessity of our facilities  equipment and personnel
