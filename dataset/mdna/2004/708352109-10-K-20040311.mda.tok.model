item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of pennrock financial services corp  a bank holding company pennrock  its subsidiaries  the national advisory group  inc national  pension consulting services  inc 
pcs and blue ball national bank the bank  and the bank s subsidiary  pennrock insurance group  inc pigi 
this discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of pennrock and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this annual report 
pennrock s results of operations are dependent primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its assets primarily its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of the interest paid on its deposits and borrowings 
pennrock s results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses as well as non interest income  non interest expenses and income tax expense 
non interest income consists of service charges and fees for services relative to deposit accounts  investment management  retirement plan administration  fiduciary activities and credit and debit card transactions  as well as gains and losses from sales of investment securities  mortgage banking and income from bank owned life insurance 
non interest expenses consist of salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  advertising and marketing  data processing  insurance  professional fees  telecommunications and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of pennrock s loans and investments 
the results of pennrock s operations  like those of other financial institutions  are affected by our asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for commercial and mortgage financing and other types of loans  and are thus influenced by interest rates and other economic factors 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing banking and non banking investments and by general market rates of interest

critical accounting policies pennrock s financial position and results of operations are impacted by management s application of accounting policies involving judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets 
management s greatest challenge in implementing its policies is the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently less than certain 
for a detailed discussion of pennrock s significant accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a material estimate that is susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
both the estimates of the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the placement of loans on non accrual status affect the carrying amount of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is a subjective judgment that management must make regarding the loan portfolio  and is established and maintained at levels that management believes are adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
to estimate loan losses  we analyze i 
historical loan losses  ii 
current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  iii 
plans for problem loan administration and resolution  iv 
the views of regulators  v 
changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  vi 
peer group information  vii 
the economic climate and direction  viii 
increases or decreases in overall lending rates  ix 
political conditions  x 
legislation directly or indirectly impacting the banking industry  and xi 
economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas in which pennrock conducts business 
where there is a question as to the impairment of a specific loan  management obtains valuations of the property or collateral securing the loan  and current financial information of the borrower  including financial statements  when available 
since the calculation of appropriate loan loss allowances relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the american institute of certified public accountants is preparing further guidance for calculating the allowance for loan losses 
implementation of that guidance could result in an adjustment to the allowance 
for a more detailed discussion on the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses under the discussion of financial condition in this item of this report and allowance for loan losses in note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for loan losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the amount by which interest income on loans  investments and other earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the primary source of revenue for pennrock 
the amount of net interest income earned is affected by changes in interest rates and the balances of the various types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for comparative purposes  and throughout this discussion unless otherwise noted  net interest income and corresponding yields are shown on a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment will give effect to the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investments by an amount equivalent to the federal income taxes  which would have been paid if the income received on these assets were taxable at the statutory rate of for and and for net interest income is the product of the volume of average earning assets and the average rates earned on them  less the volume of average interest bearing liabilities and the average rates paid on them 
all yield and rate information is calculated on an annualized basis by dividing the income or expense item for the period by the average balance during the period 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 
interest rate spread is the difference between yield earned on average interest earning assets and the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities

table presents the adjustment required to convert net interest income to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended december   and table net interest income in thousands total interest income total interest expense net interest income tax equivalent adjustment net interest income fully taxable equivalent the amount of non taxable interest earned determines the size of tax equivalent adjustment necessary to convert net interest income into fully taxable equivalent net interest income 
the sources of non taxable interest income for pennrock are from interest earned on municipal bonds  dividends from fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc preferred stock and  to a smaller degree  from loans which qualify for tax exempt status 
the dividends earned on fannie mae and fhlmc preferred stock are tax free 
the large decline in the tax equivalent adjustment in reflects a drop in municipal bonds held in the bank s available for sale portfolio 
in  the average balance of municipal bonds owned by the bank was million while the average balance was million in changes in interest rates as well as changes in average balances or volumes of earning assets and paying liabilities have an impact on the amount of net interest income earned and the net interest margins realized by pennrock from year to year 
by isolating the effect that changes in rates have on net interest income from the effect of changes in volume  we can analyze the degree that each influences the change in net interest income and net interest margins 
table analyzes the changes in the volume and rate components of net interest income 
table volume and rate analysis of changes in interest income taxable equivalent basis in thousands year ended december  over over change due to change due to total total volume rate change volume rate change interest earned on short term investments mortgages held for sale securities loans total interest income interest paid on interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term debt total interest expense net interest income over the average balance of interest earning assets grew million in over while the average yield declined percentage points 
the volume increase generated million of additional interest income which was more than offset by the rate decline which reduced interest income by million 
total interest income declined by million 
pennrock financial services corp 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million in over while the average cost of funds declined by percentage points 
the change in interest expense relative to the increase in interest bearing liabilities actually declined by  due to the change in the various components of the liabilities 
average balance increases of million were realized in demand and savings deposits and in short term borrowings with a combined weighted average interest rate of which caused interest expense to increase  declines were realized in time deposits and long term debt of million with a combined weighted average interest rate of which caused interest expense to decrease  so even though the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased in  because the declining instruments had a substantially higher weighted average rate  interest expense relative to volume increases decreased 
the percentage point decline in weighted average rates caused interest expense to decrease by million 
since overall interest expense declined by more than interest income  net interest income increased by million in over the average balance of interest earning assets grew million in over while the average balance of interest bearing liabilities grew million 
the increase in average interest earning assets generated million of additional interest income while the increase in average interest bearing liabilities generated only million of additional interest expense  resulting in an increase of million of net interest income due to changes in volumes 
another factor that contributed to the change in our net interest income was the change in interest rates 
the average rate earned on earning assets declined percentage points which caused interest income to decline million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined percentage points which caused interest expense to decline million 
since interest income declined by more than interest expense  net interest income declined by million due to changes in interest rates 
another method of analyzing the change in net interest income is to examine the changes between interest rate spread and the net interest margin on earning assets 
the interest rate spread as shown in table is the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin takes into account the benefit derived from assets funded by interest free sources such as non interest bearing demand deposits and capital 
table interest rate spread and net interest margin on earning assets taxable equivalent basis in thousands average average average balances rate balances rate balances rate earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread interest free sources used to fund earning assets total sources of funds net interest margin the interest rate spread was unchanged at in while the net interest margin decreased percentage points 
the yield on earning assets declined percentage points 
the yield on securities available for sale declined percentage points while loan yields declined percentage points 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined percentage points not only due to lower deposit rates but also because of a shift of balances from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing demand and savings deposits 
the average cost of borrowed funds declined percentage points in the average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities declined percentage points 
pennrock financial services corp 
the interest rate spread increased percentage points while the net interest margin increased percentage points in the yield on earning assets declined percentage points 
the yield on securities available for sale declined basis points while loan yields declined percentage points 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined basis points not only due to lower deposit rates but also because of a shift of balances from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing demand and savings deposits 
the average cost of borrowed funds declined percentage points in the average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities declined percentage points 
although pennrock has realized net interest income increases over the past three years  this has been the result of interest expense declining more than interest income 
funding costs have  however  dropped as low as they are likely to go unless the federal reserve lowers interest rates even further 
fortunately  yields on earning assets are also stabilizing 
the volume of loan refinancing has declined substantially from levels experienced in while yields on securities are expected to improve due to slower prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities 
provision for loan losses the amount of provision for loan losses that was charged against earnings was million in compared with million in and million in we review the adequacy of the allowance in light of past loan loss experience  current economic conditions  size and characteristics of the loan portfolio  volume of non performing and delinquent loans and other relevant information 
net charge offs were  in  million in and  in non interest income pennrock generates non interest income in connection with fees charged on deposits and other products  asset management and trust services  retirement plan administration fees  sales of securities through the implementation of management s asset liability policy  increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance  sale and servicing of mortgage loans  and merchant  atm and debit card fees

net security gains of  million in consist of a  gain on debt securities and a  loss on equity securities 
net security gains totaled  in and million in securities gains and losses in all three years were attributable to management of pennrock s equity portfolio and to the sale of other securities for the purpose of adding liquidity  to control interest rate risk and to achieve other objectives resulting from the active management of pennrock s balance sheet

in august  the bank purchased an additional million of boli 
the bank s total investment in boli as of december  was million and million as of december  the income from boli represents the increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts and is intended to partially offset the costs of the bank s employee benefit plans including group life  disability and health insurance

provision for income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  million in and million in the statutory federal tax rate was in and and in pennrock s effective tax rate was in compared to in and in the primary reason for changes in the effective tax rate is due to the change in the amount of tax exempt income earned during the year and to the amount of tax credits available from low income housing and rehabilitation projects in which the bank becomes involved from time to time 
for a more comprehensive analysis of income tax expense  refer to note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pennrock accounts for income taxes under the liability method as specified by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in pennrock s income tax returns 
the deferred tax provision for the year is equal to the net change in the deferred tax asset and liability accounts from the beginning to the end of the year 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the principal types of accounts that result in differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are the allowance for loan losses  accumulated depreciation of fixed assets and discounts on investment securities

securities available for sale table indicates the composition and maturity of the securities available for sale afs portfolio as of december  included in the portfolio are callable agencies  state and municipal securities  mortgage backed securities including adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and cmos that may be called  prepaid or reprice before final maturity 
for mortgage backed securities  maturity is based on average lives rather than contractual maturity 
the weighted average duration of the portfolio increased from years at the end of to years at the end of duration is the weighted average present value of future cash flows from a financial instrument 
investment managers use it as an indication of the potential price volatility of a financial instrument for various changes in market interest rates 
the higher the duration  the more the market value of a portfolio would be expected to fluctuate as interest rates change 
the increase in the duration of the portfolio is  in part  attributable to an expected decline in the rate of prepayment of mortgage backed securities and cmos in the portfolio 
as prepayment speeds decrease  the average life of mortgage related securities increases

as of december   the afs portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million consisting of gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
substantially all of the gross losses were attributable to floating rate corporate notes held in the bank s afs portfolio

a cmo is a mortgage backed security that is comprised of classes of bonds created by prioritizing the cash flows from the underlying mortgage pool in order to meet different objectives of investors 
pennrock had million in mortgage backed securities and million in cmo securities at the end of all of which were fixed rate 
none of the cmos in the portfolio was considered high risk as defined by banking regulations

securities at fair value totaled million as of december  and totaled million at the end of had management elected to maintain the same proportion of securities relative to total assets from year end  the securities portfolio would be approximately million larger by the end of than it currently is 
instead  we have elected to maintain the same level of securities measured in terms of total value from year to year to provide an adequate source of secondary liquidity and cash flow and for pledging purposes  and to concentrate our efforts in growing the loan portfolio in proportion to total assets

loans as a percent of total assets increased from at the end of to by the end of this decision was made for several reasons 
first  in pure economic terms  loan yields have exceeded security yields by percentage points on average over the past two years 
second  although loans carry more credit risk and higher operational costs than securities  investments provide no opportunity to develop any additional relationships or to cross sell any additional products or services to our customers 
the third reason is to better fulfill our commitment to serve the credit needs of customers in our market area

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses table is established and maintained at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the bank s loan portfolio based upon a periodic evaluation of current information of the risks inherent in the portfolio and is monitored with continuous internal as well as semiannual independent loan reviews 
there are many elements that we evaluate to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank has an internal rating system that assigns grades for all loans except residential mortgage loans  consumer loans and commercial and commercial real estate loans under  loans are initially assigned to one of seven risk grades 
the loan officer assigns the loan rating at the time the loan is made 
these ratings may be changed over time to reflect changes in the financial condition of the borrowing entity 
if warranted  the risk rating may be lowered to eight substandard  nine doubtful or ten loss 
loans rated ten are charged off 
all loans rated seven through nine  which are considered watch loans  are assigned either a specific allowance allocation or a general allowance allocation percentage 
the specific allowance allocation is based on an analysis of each loan for which a specific allowance allocation is assigned 
general allowance allocation percentages assigned to watch loans are based upon a three year average historical loss experience for that particular risk rating 
general allowance allocation percentages are also assigned to commercial and commercial mortgage loans not on the watch loan list  for consumer loans  residential mortgage loans  letters of credit and loan commitments 
the general allowance allocation percentage assigned to categories of non watch loans are based on the three year average historical loss experience for each category of loan  letter of credit or commitment 
the sum of all allowance amounts determined by this methodology is utilized as the primary indicator of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
we may increase the allowance for loan losses to an amount higher than that computed above in response to factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination of the allowance allocation percentages 
these factors and conditions may not be adequately captured in the historical loss component and is an assessment of information delay and its impact on the timeliness of the risk rating process 
these factors and conditions include i 
general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  ii 
credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing economic conditions  iii 
trends that could affect collateral values  iv 
loan volumes and concentrations  v 
seasoning of the loan portfolio  vi 
specific industry conditions affecting portfolio segments  vii 
duration of the current business cycle  viii 
bank regulatory examination results  and ix 
the results of our internal loan review process 
in addition to the internal grading system analysis  we compare the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans to the peer group average percentage as shown in the most recently available uniform bank performance report ubpr 
when we assign loan ratings to individual loans  we consider the risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories 
these risk elements may include i 
for non farm and non residential loans  multifamily residential loans and agricultural real estate loans  the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements  ii 
for construction and land development loans  the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or ability to lease property constructed for lease  experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratios  iii 
for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the operating results of the commercial  industrial or professional enterprise  the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for similar businesses and the value  nature and marketability of collateral  and iv 
for non real estate agricultural loans  the operating results  experience and ability of the borrower  historical and expected market conditions and the value  nature and marketability of the collateral 
in addition  for each category  we consider secondary sources of income and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors 
pennrock financial services corp 
the board of directors reviews the allowance on a quarterly basis to determine whether the amount of monthly provision is adequate or whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance 
the internally classified watch list  along with the list of non accrual and non performing loans  helps the board and management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance 
loans classified as an eight substandard are loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition which may jeopardize recoverability of the loan 
loans classified as a nine doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans  but also have an increased risk that a loss may occur or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated 
both eight and nine rated loans categories may include loans that are past due at least days  are on non accrual status or have been restructured 
as of december   there were no loans rated nine or ten

liquidity the purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows available to meet a variety of needs while minimizing the cost of funds and maximizing yields on liquid assets 
these needs include financial commitments such as satisfying the credit needs of our borrowers and withdrawals by our depositors  the ability to capitalize on investment and business opportunities as they occur  and the funding of pennrock s own operations 
liquidity is measured by pennrock s ability to convert assets to cash at a reasonable cost or a minimum loss 
we achieve these objectives through the implementation of our asset liability policy 
maturities and sales of investment pennrock financial services corp

loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  but such loans generally are not readily convertible to cash and are subject to risks associated with borrower s ability to pay that may be impacted by national and local economic conditions 
accordingly  pennrock may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet loan and withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations 
such sources include fhlb advances  federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and federal reserve bank borrowings

the bank may borrow funds from the fhlb of pittsburgh and from other sources 
the fhlb system acts as an additional source of funding for financial institutions 
in addition  the bank uses federal funds lines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as funding sources 
in order to utilize the services of the fhlb  the bank is required to own stock in the fhlb 
the amount of stock held by the bank varies with the total amount of advances the bank has outstanding at any point in time 
as of december   the bank held million in stock of the fhlb 
the fhlb uses various factors to determine the amount of credit to extend to a financial institution 
these factors include i 
total regulatory capital  ii 
net income  iii 
the quality and composition of assets  iv 
lending policies and practices  v 
the level of current borrowings from all sources  and vi 
the amount of qualifying collateral 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements are another source of borrowed funds 
under this type of borrowing  securities are pledged against borrowed funds and are released when the funds are repaid 
the bank uses this type of short term borrowing alternative on an overnight basis 
the repurchase agreements with customers are part of a cash management account arrangement the bank maintains with certain of its larger corporate customers 
short term borrowings increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  of the repurchase agreements outstanding at year end  million were with bank customers while million were outstanding at the fhlb 
the level of short term borrowings depends on loan growth  deposit growth  current market rates and other factors 
the large increase in short term borrowings in was required to fund the increase in the loan portfolio since there was insufficient growth in deposits to do so 
as previously indicated  loans grew million in while deposits grew million 
we chose to fund the excess loan growth with short term borrowing since they represented the least expensive source of funds readily available

million of these convertible advances further restrict the fhlb s ability to call the advance unless the month libor rate is at or above a specified rate 
if the fhlb exercises its option to convert an advance  the bank has the option to repay the advance in full

also during the second quarter of  two advances totaling million were paid off and replaced by new advances at lower interest rates 
the prepayment penalty assessed by the fhlb is being amortized over the life of the new advances in accordance with eitf debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments issued by the fasb in pennrock financial services corp

banking organizations must adjust their assets and off balance sheet exposures by assigning risk weighted percentages  ranging for to  depending on regulatory defined credit risks 
off balance sheet assets must be converted to credit equivalents before being risk weighted 
these risk weighted on and off balance sheet balances are then added to determine total risk weighted assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pennrock s financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we manage credit risk by relying on strict credit standards  loan review and adequate loan loss reserves 
interest rate risk refers to pennrock s degree of exposure to loss of earnings resulting from changes in market interest rates 
as a financial intermediary  pennrock invests in various types of interest earning assets primarily loans and securities that are funded largely by interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowed funds 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
the disparity of sensitivity between financial assets and liabilities creates interest rate risk for pennrock 
the magnitude of this exposure depends on the severity and timing of the market rate changes and on our ability to adjust the composition of the balance sheet in reaction to those changes 
pennrock s asset liability management committee the alco addresses this risk 
pennrock s executive management team comprises the alco 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by modeling the estimated net interest income and net income under various interest rate scenarios 
the alco attempts to manage the various components of pennrock s balance sheet to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on net interest income and net income 
however  the alco may sometimes structure the balance sheet to take advantage of expected interest rate movements 
pennrock financial services corp 
pennrock s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using various types of interest rate sensitivity analyses to determine pennrock s change in net interest income and net income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
if the potential changes to net interest income and net income resulting from hypothetical interest rate swings are not within the exposure limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
pennrock s net interest income  the most significant component of its net income  is impacted by changes in market interest rates and yield curves  particularly if there are differences  or gaps  in the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities which fund them 
the alco monitors such interest rate gaps and seeks to manage interest rate risk by adjusting the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
if more assets than liabilities mature or reprice within a given time frame  pennrock is considered asset sensitive 
if more liabilities mature or reprice during the time frame  pennrock is liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive gap will generally benefit pennrock in a period of rising rates while a liability sensitive gap will generally benefit pennrock during declining rates 
gap analysis has certain limitations 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
some types of financial instruments are very sensitive to changes in market rates while others may lag behind such changes 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have limits on the amount of change in interest rates allowed in the short term periodic caps and over the life of the loan lifetime caps 
further  changes in interest rates may change the characteristics of certain financial instruments and cause them to react differently than expected due to imbedded options 
for example  a decrease in market rates could trigger the option that allows mortgage customers to refinance their mortgages while an increase in market rates may induce customers to exercise their option to redeem their certificates of deposit prior to maturity 
although the alco tries to consider such customer behavior when calculating changes in net interest income and net income  actual results could deviate significantly from the assumptions used 
while alco continuously monitors and adjusts the gap position to maximize profitability  the primary objective is to maintain net interest income and net income within self imposed parameters for a wide range of possible changes in interest rates 
the following table presents an interest sensitivity analysis of pennrock s assets and liabilities as of december  all interest rates are on a tax equivalent basis 
pennrock financial services corp 
table interest sensitivity analysis in thousands december  interest sensitivity period more than more than more than less than months to months year to more than months months to year years years total earning assets short term investments weighted average interest rate mortgages held for sale weighted average interest rate securities available for sale weighted average interest rate loans weighted average interest rate total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits weighted average interest rate savings deposits weighted average interest rate time deposits weighted average interest rate short term borrowings weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap period cumulative interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities ratio period cumulative assumes now account balances are withdrawn at per year 
assumes savings balances are withdrawn at per year 
this analysis indicates that pennrock is asset sensitive up to the five year time frame 
this means that pennrock s balance sheet should be well positioned for rising interest rates 
if  however  alco is concerned that rates may fall within the next year and that a drop in market rates would reduce net interest income and net income  it can take action to reduce the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet such as by purchasing fixed rate securities and funding such purchases with short term borrowings 
the alco believes that the probability for the future change in interest rates is toward higher rates rather than lower rates and is therefore comfortable with the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet 
at some point in  the alco may take steps to reduce pennrock s exposure to higher rates even further by reducing the amount of short term borrowings and other interest sensitive liabilities by attracting fixed rate time deposits  utilizing fixed rate advances at the fhlb  or other means 
while the preceding table helps provide some information about pennrock s interest sensitivity within one year  it is not reliable in predicting the trends of future earnings in the longer term 
for this reason  we use financial modeling to forecast earnings under different interest rate projections 
pennrock s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes a maximum decrease in the net interest income and net income in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of percentage points 
the pennrock financial services corp 
following tables present the bank s projected change in net interest income and net income for and percentage point rate shocks as of december  and the board s established limit 
the impact on net interest income and net income relate to the bank only 
the assets and liabilities of the parent company only or for national and pcs are not considered in this analysis and their corresponding earnings at risk do not have a significant effect on this analysis 
table changes in net interest income in thousands net interest computed percent board change in interest rates income change change limit percentage point rise percentage point rise base rate scenario percentage point decline percentage point decline table changes in net income in thousands computed percent board change in interest rates net income change change limit percentage point rise percentage point rise base rate scenario percentage point decline percentage point decline the preceding tables indicate that as of december   in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates  both pennrock s net interest income and net income would be expected to decrease million and million respectively 
however  if market rates increased by percentage points  net interest income and net income would be expected to increase by million and million respectively 
this simulation analysis agrees with table gap analysis that indicates that pennrock is asset sensitive 
pennrock s interest income and net income increase if rates rise and decline if rates fall 
at december   pennrock s estimated changes in net interest income and net income given a percentage point increase in interest rates are well within policy limits 
however  pennrock s estimated changes in net interest income and net income given a percentage point decrease in interest rates are outside of policy limits 
with alco s expectation that rates are more likely to rise than fall especially with an apparently improving national economy  the board of directors has indicated that they are satisfied with this exception to policy 
computation of forecasted effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
these include loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates  calls of callable securities  conversions of fixed rate fhlb advances to adjustable advances  and rates of deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
even minor changes in these assumptions may significantly alter the results of the model 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could take to mitigate any negative effects of changes in interest rates as discussed above
