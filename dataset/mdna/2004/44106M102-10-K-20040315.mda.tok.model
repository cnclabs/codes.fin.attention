item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts overview the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
hotel industry conditions as a result of terrorism concerns  the war with iraq and the impact of a recessionary economy  the us hotel industry has experienced significant declines in occupancy  revenues and profitability since these declines primarily arose from reduced business travel 
during  most of our hotel operators reported declines in the operating performance of our hotels versus as described below  during tenants under three leases for an aggregate of hotels failed to pay rents due to us 
we have subsequently entered new long term operating agreements for these hotels 
under these new agreements we expect our future income and cash flows from the hotels will be less than the rents we previously received 
all of our operating agreements contain security features  such as security deposits and in certain instances  guarantees  which are intended to protect payment of minimum rents and owner s priority returns to us 
however  the effectiveness of these various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if the current hotel industry operating conditions continue at depressed levels for extended periods 
if additional tenants  hotel operators or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues and cash flows may decline further 
developments acquisition of staybridge suites by holiday inn 
on july   we purchased staybridge suites for  from intercontinental 
we simultaneously leased these hotels to our taxable reit subsidiary  or trs  which entered into a long term management agreement with a subsidiary of intercontinental to operate the hotels 
under this agreement intercontinental agreed to pay us minimum annual returns of  per year until  plus additional returns based upon the gross revenues and net cash flows realized at these hotels 
acquisition of candlewood suites 
on july   we purchased seven candlewood suites hotels from candlewood hotel company  inc  or candlewood  for  simultaneous with this purchase  we added these seven hotels to our existing lease for candlewood suites hotels with candlewood 
when these hotels were added to this existing lease  the rent payable by candlewood to us was increased by  per year  plus a percentage of hotel operating revenues in excess of negotiated amounts

shortly thereafter we terminated wyndham s occupancy and engaged candlewood to manage the hotels on an interim basis 
on september   we entered an agreement with intercontinental to manage and rebrand these hotels 
on october   intercontinental began to manage the hotels and of the hotels were rebranded as staybridge suites by holiday inn 
one hotel continues to be operated as a summerfield suites by wyndham hotel and we expect it will be rebranded under a different intercontinental brand or sold 
this agreement provides that we will be paid a priority owner s return of  per year  plus percentage participations in hotel operating revenues in excess of negotiated amounts 
intercontinental has provided a limited guarantee of our priority return of  per year until december  and  per year thereafter 
as part of this agreement  we will fund  for rebranding costs and deferred capital improvements and intercontinental will provide us with a deposit of  to secure its obligations under its management agreement and guarantee  as of december    of these fundings occurred and the balance is expected to take place over the next two years 
the management agreement for our staybridge suites by holiday inn managed by intercontinental described above was amended to include these hotels 
the combined agreement for these hotels has an initial term expiring in and intercontinental has two renewal options for years each thereafter 
agreement with prime hospitality corp

shortly thereafter we terminated wyndham s occupancy and engaged crestline hotels and resorts  inc to manage the hotels on an interim basis 
on july   prime defaulted on its lease for amerisuites hotels that we own 
subsequent to its default  prime continued to manage the hotels while we held discussions with prime and others concerning the long term operations of these hotels 
on december   we entered into an agreement with prime for the management of all of these hotels the wyndham hotels and amerisuites hotels 
this agreement provides that our wyndham hotels will be rebranded as prime sm hotels and resorts and that our amerisuites hotels will remain branded as amerisuites 
this agreement also provides that prime will pay us an owner s priority return of  per year plus of cash flow after payment of operating costs  payment of our priority return  funding the ff e reserve and reimbursement of working capital and guaranty advances  if any 
prime has provided a limited guarantee of our priority return of  per year 
as part of this agreement  we agreed to fund  for rebranding costs and other capital improvements 
as of december    of funding has occurred and the balance is expected to take place during the next two years 
this agreement has an initial term expiring in and prime has two consecutive renewal options for years each thereafter 
this agreement was effective january   with respect to the amerisuites hotels and was effective for the prime sm hotels resorts on february  upon effectiveness of our management agreement with prime on january   we settled all our outstanding claims with prime arising from its lease default  including our retention of the security  guarantee and ff e reserve deposits totaling approximately  this agreement requires that  of the security deposit be applied to pay the difference between prime s contractual rent obligations and the cash rent received from prime from july  to december   and this amount was recorded as rental income in the fourth quarter 
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  the balance of the retained deposits and the value of other property received from prime  totaling approximately  will be amortized into our income during the initial term of prime s new management contract for the affected hotels 
agreements with candlewood and intercontinental 
on december   we completed several previously announced agreements for the termination of our lease with candlewood for candlewood suites hotels  our acquisition of candlewood suites hotels from candlewood for  and management of our candlewood suites hotels by intercontinental 
simultaneously with the closing of these transactions  intercontinental purchased the rights to the candlewood suites brand from candlewood

this agreement has an initial term expiring in and intercontinental has two consecutive renewal options for years each thereafter 
in connection with candlewood s release from its lease obligations  we retained a security deposit and capital improvements escrow totaling approximately  plus certain improvements to our properties which had been purchased by candlewood 
we recorded a  million gain on lease termination as a result of this transaction in the fourth quarter 
wyndham settlement 
on december   we entered an agreement with wyndham settling all outstanding claims arising from its lease defaults discussed above 
this agreement provided for our retention of security and capital reserve deposits totaling approximately  plus certain improvements to our properties which had been purchased by wyndham  payment by wyndham to us of  in cash and other matters 
we recorded a  gain in the fourth quarter in connection with this settlement 
leases and management agreements as of january   each of our hotels is included in one of eight combinations of hotels which is either leased to one of our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries  or trs  and managed by an independent hotel operating company or leased to a third party 
at january   we have managed hotels and leased hotels 
our consolidated income statement includes hotel operating revenues and expenses of our managed hotels  and only rental income for leased hotels 
additional information regarding the terms of our leases and management agreements is included in the table on pages and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues were  for  a increase over revenues of  for this increase is primarily due to an increased number of managed hotels and the  of gains recorded on lease terminations described above 
rental income was  a decrease from  for this decrease is due primarily to the elimination of  of rental income in for the hotels previously leased to wyndham which began to be managed by third parties in april and may  and the replacement of  of rental income from subsidiaries of marriott with hotel operating revenues and expenses for hotels which were converted from leased to managed hotels during and these decreases were partially offset by rental income resulting from our acquisition of candlewood hotels in april and seven candlewood hotels in july  and from returns from our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels during and ff e reserve income represents amounts paid by our tenants into restricted accounts owned by us  the purpose of which is to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures 
the terms of our leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels 
the ff e reserve income was  for  a decrease from ff e reserve income of  for this decrease is due primarily to reduced levels of hotel sales attributable to the general slowdown of business travel across the united states and the lease defaults described above 
part of this decrease is also due to activities related to the marriott hotels which were leased and began to be managed at various times during and  as discussed above 
the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels are not separately stated in our consolidated statement of income 
our managed hotels had operating revenues of  during the period for which they were managed  a increase over hotel operating revenues of  in our managed hotels also had operating expenses of  during the period for which they were managed  a increase over hotel operating expenses of  in the increases in hotel operating revenues and expenses were caused by the increase in the number of managed hotels in due to i the initiation of new management agreements in april and may for the hotels previously leased to wyndham  ii our july acquisition of hotels and the initiation of a management agreement for these hotels  and iii the marriott hotels converted from leased to managed hotels during and hotel operating revenues of our managed hotels at december   were  for  a decrease of from hotel operating revenues of  in including revenues which relate to periods prior to our ownership of some of these hotels and for periods when some of the hotels were leased from us by third parties due primarily to a decline in revenue per available room  or revpar 
this decrease is attributable primarily to the general slowdown of business travel in the united states and the impact of changes in management of some of our hotels resulting from the wyndham lease defaults 
hotel operating expenses for these hotels were  in  a increase from hotel operating expenses of  in including expenses which relate to periods prior to our ownership of some of these hotels and for periods when some of the hotels were leased from us by third parties 
this increase is due primarily to higher wage and benefits costs 
our managed hotels had net operating results that were  in and  in less than the minimum returns due to us 
these amounts have been reflected in our statement of income as a net reduction to hotel operating expenses in each year because they were funded by our managers 
we expect further declines in rental income and ff e reserve income and increases in hotel operating revenues and expenses in due to the termination of our leases with prime and candlewood and our new management agreements for these hotels as described above 
in addition  seven hotels currently leased by marriott will begin to be leased to our trs and operated by marriott from time to time prior to june  interest income was for  a increase from interest income of for this increase was due to a higher average cash balance  offset to some extent by a lower average interest rate during we recorded a gain of  in due to the termination of our leases with wyndham and candlewood as described above

general and administrative expense was  for  an increase from general and administrative expense of  in this increase is due principally to the impact of additional hotel investments during and we recorded expenses on the early extinguishment of debt of  and  on february  and july   respectively  to write off the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with  and  respectively  of senior notes we redeemed 
net income was  for  a increase over net income of  for net income available for common shareholders was  for  or per share  a increase  over net income available for common shareholders of  or per share  for these increases were primarily due to the gain on lease terminations recorded in  and the other investment and operating activity discussed above 
cash flow from operations was  in  a increase from  in primarily due to the impact of changes in working capital 
cash used in investing activities was  in  a increase from  in  primarily because we purchased a greater number of hotels in cash provided by financing activities was  in  a increase over cash used in financing activities of  in  primarily because of increased borrowings to fund our hotel acquisitions  offset partially by our preferred equity issuance in and increased distributions on common and preferred shares in year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues were  for  a increase over revenues of  for this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of managed hotels and our hotel acquisitions 
rental income was  for  a increase from  for this increase is a result of our acquisition of hotels in april  partially offset by the replacement of  of rental income from marriott in with hotel operating revenues and expenses for hotels which were converted from leased to managed hotels during and ff e reserve income was  for  a decrease from ff e reserve income of  for this decrease is due primarily to reduced levels of hotel sales attributable to the general slowdown of business travel in the united states described above  offset somewhat by a scheduled increase in the applicable percentage used to calculate ff e reserves at some of our hotels 
part of this decrease is also due to activities related to the marriott hotels which were leased and began to be managed at various times during and the revenues which are escrowed as ff e reserves for hotels leased by our trs are not separately stated in our consolidated statements of income 
our managed hotels had operating revenues of  during the period for which they were managed  a increase over hotel operating revenues of  in our managed hotels also had operating expenses of  during the period for which they were managed  a increase over hotel operating expenses of  in the increases in hotel operating revenues and expenses were caused by the increase in the number of managed hotels during due to the marriott hotels converted from leases to management agreements during and and the four hotels we acquired from marriott in which were also managed by them 
hotel operating revenues at our managed hotels at december   were  for  a decrease of from hotel operating revenues of  in including revenues which relate to when some of the hotels were leased from us by third parties due primarily to a decline in revpar 
this decrease is attributable primarily to the general slowdown of business travel across the united states 
hotel operating expenses for these hotels were  in  a increase from hotel operating expenses of  in including expenses which relate to periods when some of the hotels were leased from us by third parties

liquidity and capital resources our tenants and operators as of january   all of our hotels are operated under leases or management agreements that provide for minimum rents or returns to us 
all costs of operating and maintaining our hotels are paid by the third party hotel tenants for their own account or by third party hotel managers as agent for us 
these third parties derive their funding for hotel operating expenses  ff e reserves  and rents and returns due us generally from hotel operating revenues and  to the extent that these parties fund our minimum rents and returns under their guarantees to us  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our eight combination hotel leases or management agreements as total hotel sales minus all expenses which are not subordinated to minimum payments to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our agreements is presented in the table on pages and assuming our operating agreements as of january   had been in place  five of our eight hotel combinations  representing hotels  would have generated coverage of at least x during  and four hotel combinations  representing hotels  would have generated coverage of at least x during two hundred fifteen hotels we own in six combinations  of our total investments  at cost  are operated under leases or management agreements which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if combined total hotel sales less total hotel expenses and required ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed amounts due to us 
our tenants and managers or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our hotels in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our hotels 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our leases or management agreements  do not subject us to repayment obligations but  under some of our agreements  these guarantee or supplemental payments may be recovered by the third party tenant or operator from the future cash flows from our hotels after our future minimum rents and returns are paid 
as of december   all payments due  including those payments due under leases or operating agreements whose hotels have generated less than x coverage during  are current 
however  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if travel patterns continue at depressed levels for extended periods 
some of our leases and guarantees require our tenants  subtenants and guarantors to maintain minimum net worths  as defined in the agreements 
on february   barcelo crestline wrote to us that its subsidiary which is our tenant for hotels is not in compliance with the net worth requirements of its lease 
payments to us under this lease are guaranteed by marriott pursuant to a limited funding obligation  and  as of december  and through march   these rent payments are current 
accordingly  we have notified barcelo crestline that we will take no action to default this lease at this time provided no other event of default occurs 
if our tenants  hotel managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues will decline and our ability to continue to make distributions to our shareholders will be jeopardized 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are rents from our leased properties and minimum returns from our managed hotels 
minimum rents and minimum returns are received from our tenants and managers monthly and percentage rents and returns are received either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  interest and distributions 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
we maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
in federal legislation known as the reit modernization act  or rma  was enacted and became effective on january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to a trs if the hotel is managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trs in excess of the rent it pays to us is subject to income tax at corporate tax rates 
as and if the financial performance of the hotels operated for the account of our trs improves  these taxes may become material  but the anticipated taxes are not material to our consolidated financial results at this time 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at most of our hotels are escrowed as reserves for future renovations and refurbishment  or ff e reserves 
as of december   there was approximately  on deposit in these escrow accounts  of which  was held directly by us and reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
the remaining is held in accounts owned by our tenants and is not reflected on our balance sheet 
we have security and remainder interests in the accounts owned by our tenants 
during   was contributed to these accounts and  was spent from these accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate occasional cash needs that may result from timing differences between the receipt of rents and returns and the need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
our credit facility matures in june and may be extended at our option to june upon our payment of an extension fee 
borrowings under the credit facility can be up to  and the credit facility includes a feature under which the maximum amount available for borrowing may be expanded to  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our credit facility are unsecured 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable at a spread above libor per annum at december  
as of december   we had  outstanding on our facility 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and  available on our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our credit facility or other lines of credit and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions 
at december   we had no commitments to purchase additional properties 
however  we expect to make improvements and finish a modernization program at of our courtyard by marriott hotels 
these hotels contain  rooms  representing of the total courtyard by marriott rooms that we own 
upon completion  approximately  of the estimated  cost for this project will have been funded with amounts on deposit in ff e reserve accounts 
during  we funded the additional  of costs with cash on hand or borrowings under our credit facility 
the remaining costs of  are expected to be funded from the ff e reserve accounts during the first half of our minimum annual rent for these hotels increased by of the amount we funded in addition to the ff e reserve funding 
we have also committed to fund improvements at of our residence inn by marriott hotels 
these hotels contain  rooms  representing of the total residence inn by marriott rooms that we own 
upon completion  approximately  of the estimated  cost for this project will have been funded with amounts on deposit in ff e reserve accounts 
during  we funded  of the additional costs and expect to fund the remaining  in with existing cash balances or borrowings under our credit facility 
our minimum annual rent for these hotels increases by of the amount we fund in addition to the ff e reserve funding 
pursuant to the agreement we entered with intercontinental on september   for management of hotels  we agreed to fund  for rebranding costs and other capital improvements during the next two years 
as part of this agreement  intercontinental will provide us with a  deposit to secure its obligations under the management agreement that we will not escrow 
as of december    of these fundings have occurred and the balance is expected to take place over the next two years 
pursuant to the agreement we entered with prime on december   for management of hotels  we agreed to fund  for rebranding costs and other capital improvements during the next two years 
as of december    of funding has occurred and the balance is expected to take place during the next two years 
on january   and september   we issued  and  respectively  of senior notes due net proceeds after underwriting and other offering expenses were  and  respectively 
on february   we redeemed at par plus accrued interest  all  of our outstanding senior notes due our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in   in and  in as of december   we had one mortgage note we assumed in connection with our acquisition of a hotel with a principal balance of  this mortgage note requires monthly payments of principal and interest and is expected to have a principal balance of  at maturity in none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity date 
on december   a distribution of per common share was declared with respect to fourth quarter results and was paid to shareholders on january   using cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facility 
on february   we sold  of our common shares of beneficial interest at per share in a public offering 
on march   we sold an additional  common shares of beneficial interest at per share pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
net proceeds  from both these sales  after underwriting and other offering expenses  were  these proceeds were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on march   we announced that we will redeem all of our outstanding series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares at the stated liquidation preference price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
this redemption is expected to occur on or about april  we expect to fund this redemption with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
when amounts are outstanding on our revolving credit facility and  as the maturity dates of our credit facility and term debt approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional long term debt and issuing new equity securities 
as of december   we had  available on our shelf registration 
this amount was reduced by our february and march sales of common shares and after completion of these transactions we had  available on our shelf registration 
an effective shelf registration allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for securities offered by us 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any debt or equity security offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financing  including investment grade debt or equity securities offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions and to pay our debt and other obligations 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations ground lease obligations total nine of our hotels are on leased land 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payment of ground lease obligations are made by our tenants or managers 
however  if a tenant or manager fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december   were our revolving credit facility  our  of publicly issued term debt and our  mortgage note 
our public debt is governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our credit agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our bank credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit agreement  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of million or more 
similarly  a default on our public debt indenture would be a default on our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   our secured debt obligations were limited to one mortgage note of  secured by a single property 
none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
related party transactions we have an agreement with rmr to provide investment  management and administrative services to us 
rmr is beneficially owned by barry m 
portnoy and gerard m 
martin  each a managing trustee and member of our board of trustees 
this agreement is subject to the annual review of our independent trustees 
each of our executive officers is also an officer of rmr 
our independent trustees  including all of our trustees other than messrs 
portnoy and martin  review our contract with rmr at least annually and make determinations regarding its negotiation  renewal or termination 
any termination of our contract with rmr would cause a default under our bank credit facility  if not approved by a majority of lenders 
our current contract term with rmr expires on december  rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our average real estate investments  as defined  up to the first million of such investments and thereafter plus an incentive fee based upon increases in cash available for distribution per share  as defined 
the incentive fee payable to rmr is paid in our common shares 
in october  we entered into an agreement between us and hrpt  pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with respect to our shares held by hrpt and use reasonable efforts to effect the registration of those shares 
hrpt paid the expenses of this registration 
the registration statement became effective october  critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our three most critical accounting policies concern our investments in hotels and are as follows classification of leases 
certain of our hotel investments are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased hotel  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation expense 
the acquisition cost of each hotel investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and improvements  and each component generally has a different useful life 
for hotels acquired subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocate the value of real estate acquired among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management s estimates or  under some circumstances  studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the term of the respective lease 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods required by generally accepted accounting principles 
impairment of assets 
we periodically evaluate our hotel investments for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related hotel investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that hotel 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
variable interest entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  that was effective for all enterprises with variable interest entities created after january  in december  fasb issued a revised fin  which provided for the deferral of the effective date of the interpretation to january   for variable interest entities created prior to january  under fin  if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
generally  expected losses and expected residual returns are the expected negative and positive variability  respectively  in the fair value of the variable interest entities net assets 
when our trs enters a new operating agreement or materially modifies an existing operating agreement we are required to assess if we are or continue to be the primary beneficiary 
this assessment requires us to make estimates of the future cash flows of our trs 
incorrect assumptions or estimates of  among other things  occupancy  average daily room rate and operating expenses of our hotels may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
we did not deconsolidate any previously consolidated entity as a result of adopting fin in in the first quarter of  we will be required to complete our fin valuation of two additional trs entities that we currently consolidate 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our hotels operate 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to hotels we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property leases  operating agreements and tenant operating statistics as of january   we owned hotels which are grouped into eight combinations and leased to or managed by separate affiliates of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host marriott corporation  or host  barcelo crestline corporation  or barcelo crestline  prime  and homestead 
the tables on the following pages summarize the key terms of our leases and management agreements and include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our tenants and managers 
these statistics include occupancy  average daily rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  and coverage of our minimum rents or owner s priority returns 
we consider these statistics  and the lease or management agreement security features also presented in the tables on the following pages  to be important measures of our tenants and managers success in operating our hotels and their ability to make continued payments to us 
however  none of this third party reported information is a direct measure of our financial performance

seasonality our hotels have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of the us hotel industry with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income because our contractual lease and management agreements require our tenants managers to make the substantial portion of our rents and return payments to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
seasonality may affect our hotel operating revenues  but we do not expect seasonal variations to have a material impact upon our financial results of operations or upon our tenants or operators ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross hotel revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our tenants or operators operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants or operators operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our rents or returns 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our properties  all of our operating agreements contain security features  such as security deposits and in certain instances  guarantees of our rent or return 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
as of december   our outstanding publicly traded debt consisted of four issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually million million no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately million 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately million 
each of our fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
for example  in we redeemed at par our million senior notes due in we funded this redemption with cash on hand and proceeds from our issuance of million senior notes due in we have one mortgage payable secured by a hotel in wichita  ks  with a fixed rate of that matures on july  this note requires principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to an amortization schedule and contains a provision that allows us to make repayment at a premium to face value after august  our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in june we can extend the maturity for one year for a fee 
at december   we had million outstanding and million available for drawing under our revolving credit facility 
repayments under our revolving credit facility may be made at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility are subject to interest at libor plus a premium 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of million at december   was per annum 
the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year dollars in thousands dollars in thousands at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving bank credit facility
