these policies may provide uninsured motorist coverage  which provides coverage to insureds and their employees for bodily injury and property damage caused by an uninsured party  workers compensation insurance  which provides coverage to employers for their obligations to provide workers compensation benefits as required by applicable statutes  including medical payments  rehabilitation costs  lost wages  and disability and death benefits 
these policies also provide coverage to employees for their liability exposures under the common law  and general liability insurance  which insures policyholders against third party liability for bodily injury and property damage  including liability for products sold and covers the cost of the defense of claims alleging such damages 
specialty lines segment the group s specialty lines segment  which accounted for of net premiums written in includes primarily commercial umbrella insurance  which indemnifies policyholders for liability and defense costs which exceed coverage provided by the underlying primary policies  typically commercial automobile and general liability policies  and provides coverage for some items not covered by underlying policies  and item continued fidelity and surety  which insure against dishonest acts of bonded employees and the non performance of parties under contracts  respectively 
personal lines segment the group s personal lines segment  which accounted for the remaining of net premiums written in  includes primarily personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals 
the following table shows the group s total property and casualty net premiums written by operating segments and selected product lines for the periods indicated 
net premiums written include gross premiums less premiums ceded pursuant to reinsurance programs 
statutory net premiums written operating segments and selected product lines in millions or markets commercial lines workers compensation commercial auto general liability cmp  bop  fire and inland marine specialty lines commercial umbrella fidelity and surety personal lines new jersey personal auto other personal lines other personal auto homeowners total all lines    property and casualty statutory net premiums written decreased million in from this decrease resulted from personal lines withdrawal from selected markets  stricter underwriting guidelines for commercial lines  including the non renewal of certain construction defect related risks and workers compensation risks in several states and higher reinsurance costs  primarily for the commercial umbrella product line 
the net premiums written decrease in from can be attributed primarily to the non renewal of the group s new jersey private passenger auto business that began in march of as of year end there are no remaining new jersey private passenger auto policies 
item continued c narrative description of business marketing and distribution the group is represented by approximately  independent insurance agencies with over  agents 
these agents also represent other unaffiliated companies which may compete with the group 
the six claim and seven underwriting and service offices operated by the group assist these independent agents in producing and servicing the group s business 
certain agencies that meet established profitability and production targets are eligible for key agent status 
at december   these agencies represented of the group s total agency force and wrote of its book of business 
the policies placed by key agents have consistently produced a lower statutory loss ratio for the group than policies placed by other agents 
the group targets small business customers for its commercial lines segment 
the group s typical commercial lines customer is a small business with minimal number of employees and a need to conveniently purchase a package of coverages 
for the year  this commercial lines customer group  categorized by commercial liability premium volume  included approximately contractors artisans  mercantile  building premises  and manufacturers 
the group believes this small business customer group offers an opportunity to achieve superior underwriting results through development and maintenance of strong agent and customer relationships and application of the group s underwriting and pricing expertise 
the group markets its specialty lines segment predominately to policyholders who have purchased commercial automobile and general liability policies and have a need for additional coverage under umbrella policies to cover costs which might exceed the underlying policies limits or are not covered under such policies 
the group markets personal automobile insurance primarily to standard and preferred risk drivers 
standard and preferred risk drivers are those who have met certain criteria  including a driving record which reflects a low historical incidence of at fault accidents and moving violations of traffic laws 
the group does not target non standard risk drivers who fall outside these criteria

periodically  the investment portfolios are reallocated subject to the parameters set by the investment committee 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a regular basis to determine the optimal investment strategy based upon the factors mentioned above 
throughout and  equity securities were sold  many of which had substantially appreciated in value compared to earlier periods 
this sale program was in response to a decision to reduce equity holdings in favor of investment grade fixed maturities 
assets relating to property and casualty operations are invested to maximize after tax returns with appropriate diversification of risk 
as a result of improved underwriting profitability  the corporation and the group began gradually increasing funds invested in tax exempt fixed maturities in tax exempt fixed maturity securities as a percentage of amortized cost  increased to of the fixed item continued maturity available for sale portfolio at december   versus at december  and at december  assets relating to property and casualty operations are invested to maximize after tax returns with appropriate diversification of risk 
the consolidated fixed maturity portfolio has an intermediate duration and a laddered maturity structure 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio at december  was approximately years 
the corporation and the group remain fully invested and do not build up large cash positions in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the corporation and the group also have no off balance sheet investments or arrangements as defined by section a of the sarbanes oxley act of the following table sets forth the carrying values and other data of invested assets as of the end of the years indicated distribution of invested assets in millions average rating total total total us government available for sale aaa states  municipalities and political subdivisions investment grade available for sale aa below investment grade available for sale corporate securities investment grade available for sale a    held to maturity a below investment grade available for sale bb mortgage backed securities investment grade available for sale aaa   held to maturity aaa below investment grade available for sale b total fixed maturities    equity securities short term investments total securities    total carrying value of securities    total amortized cost of securities    item continued at december   the available for sale fixed maturity portfolio totaled  million  which consisted of investment grade securities and below investment grade securities 
the market value of the below investment grade portfolio was million at december  the held to maturity fixed maturity portfolio totaled million carried at amortized cost at december  and consisted entirely of investment grade securities 
investments are classified as below investment grade based upon the higher of the ratings provided by standard poor s ratings services s p and moody s investors service moody s 
when a security is not rated by either s p or moody s  the securities are classified based upon the ratings of other agencies  including the national association of insurance commissioners 
the market value of split rated fixed maturity investments ie  those having an investment grade rating from one rating agency and a below investment grade from another rating agency was million at december  investments in below investment grade securities have greater risks than investments in investment grade securities 
the risk of default by borrowers that issue below investment grade securities is significant because these borrowers are often highly leveraged and more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  including a recession or a sharp increase in interest rates 
additionally  investments in below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and subordinated to other debt 
investment grade securities are also subject to significant risks relating to the issuer  including additional leveraging  changes in control or worse than previously expected operating results 
in most instances  investors are unprotected with respect to these risks  the effects of which can be substantial

as of december   of the equity portfolio was invested in five companies and the largest single position was of the total equity portfolio 
at december   the percentage represented by the top five holdings accounted for of the total equity portfolio  and the largest single position was of the total equity portfolio 
the portfolio strategy  with respect to common stocks  is to invest in companies whose stocks have below average valuations but above average growth prospects 
the corporation and the group focus on large companies with dominant market positions  excellent profitability and strong balance sheets 
equity securities are marked to fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result  shareholders equity and statutory surplus fluctuate with changes in the value of the equity portfolio 
the effects of future stock market volatility is managed by maintaining an appropriate ratio of equity securities to shareholders equity and statutory surplus 
item continued liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae are established for the estimated ultimate costs of settling claims for insured events  both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  based on information known as of the evaluation date 
as more information becomes available and claims are settled  the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward with the effect of increasing or decreasing net income at the time of the adjustments 
the effect of these adjustments may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the group 
the estimated liabilities include direct costs of the loss under terms of insurance policies  as well as legal fees and general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
the effect of catastrophes on the group s results cannot be accurately predicted and may have a material adverse effect on the group s results 
in  and  the group was impacted by  and catastrophes  respectively 
the largest incurred catastrophe loss in each of these years was million  million and million  respectively 
additional catastrophes with over million in incurred losses numbered nine in  six in and four in for additional discussion of catastrophe losses  please refer to item  note  losses and loss reserves  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages and of this form k 
in the normal course of business  the group is involved in disputes and litigation regarding the terms of insurance contracts and the amount of liability under such contracts arising from insured events 
the liabilities for losses and lae include estimates of the amounts for which the group may be liable upon settlement or other conclusion of such litigation 
because of the inherent future uncertainties in estimating ultimate costs of settling claims  actual losses and lae may deviate substantially from the amounts recorded in the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  the timing  frequency and extent of adjustments to the estimated liabilities cannot be accurately predicted since conditions  events and trends which led to historical loss and loss adjustment expense development and which serve as the basis for estimating ultimate claims cost may not occur in the future in exactly the same manner  if at all 
the anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating the liability for losses and lae based on historical loss development trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards  policy provisions and general economic trends 
the following tables present an analysis of losses and lae and related liabilities for the periods indicated 
the first table represents the impact of current and prior accident years on calendar year losses and lae 
the second table displays the development of losses and lae liabilities as of successive year end evaluations for each of the past ten years

the group purchases reinsurance to protect against large or catastrophic losses 
there are several programs that provide reinsurance coverage and the programs in effect for are summarized below 
the group s property per risk program covers property losses in excess of million for a single insured  for a single event 
this property per risk program covers up to million in losses in excess of the million retention level for a single event 
the retention on the property per risk excess of loss treaty increased from million in to million in the group s casualty per occurrence program covers liability losses 
workers compensation  umbrella and other casualty reinsurance cover liability losses up to million  million and million  respectively  in excess of the million retention level for a single insured event 
beginning in  the group retains of casualty losses applicable to the million excess of million layer 
in addition  beginning in  the group retains percent of all umbrella losses applicable to the million excess of million layer 
the casualty reinsurance treaty includes a layer of coverage of million in excess of million that consists of a fund managed by the group  and the group has title to the assets 
ceded premiums are paid by the group into the fund and reinsured losses are paid to the group under the terms of the reinsurance agreement with various reinsurers 
the reinsurers bear the risk of losses in excess of the fund 
the group s holding title to the assets and managing the investments of the fund reduces credit risk related to reinsurers 
the balance of the fund as of december  was approximately million 
the group also has a surety excess of loss treaty which covers million excess of million ultimate net loss each loss event  subject to a limit of million for any one contract year 
the group retains of losses in the million excess of million layer 
the property catastrophe reinsurance program protects the group against an accumulation of losses arising from one defined catastrophic occurrence or series of events 
this program provides million of coverage in excess of the group s million retention level 
in response to reduced exposures to catastrophic events  the catastrophe excess of loss treaty changed from million in excess of million in to million in excess of million in the treaty was written on a multiple year basis for years with only a portion of the reinsurance layers expiring in a single year 
this provides continuity  maintains rates and preserves each reinsurer s share of the overall program 
over the last years  two events triggered coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
losses and lae from the fires in oakland  california in totaled million and losses and lae from hurricane andrew in totaled million 
both of these losses exceeded the prior retention level of million  resulting in significant recoveries from reinsurers 
reinsurance limits are purchased to cover exposure to catastrophic events having the probability of occurring every years 
gai agreed to maintain reinsurance on the commercial lines business that the group acquired from gai and its affiliates in for loss dates prior to december  gai is obligated to reimburse the group if gai s reinsurers are unable to pay claims with respect to the acquired commercial lines business 
item continued reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are reviewed and those that are determined by the group to have insufficient financial strength are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large number of reinsurers are utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
the group also records an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts  as deemed necessary 
during the last three fiscal years  no reinsurer accounted for more than of total ceded premiums  excluding the security trust fund 
as a result of these controls  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
all of the company s insurance subsidiaries  except ocnj  have entered into an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement with the company 
the purpose of this agreement is to pool or share proportionately the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting operations through reinsurance  reduce administration expenses  and broaden each participating insurance subsidiary s distribution of risk 
under the terms of the intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement  all of the participants outstanding underwriting liabilities as of january  and all subsequent insurance transactions were pooled 
the participating insurance subsidiaries share in losses based on the following percentages insurance subsidiary percentage of losses the company west american american fire ohio security avomark competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
the group competes on the basis of service  price and coverage 
according to am best  based on net insurance premiums written in  the latest year for which industry wide comparison statistics are available more than billion of net premiums were written by property and casualty insurance companies in the united states and no one company or company group had a market share greater than approximately  and the group ranked as the forty fifth largest property and casualty insurance group in the united states 
item continued regulation state regulation the corporation s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they are domiciled and in which they are licensed to transact business 
the company  american fire  ohio security and ocnj are all domiciled in ohio 
west american and avomark are domiciled in indiana 
collectively  the corporation s subsidiaries are licensed to transact business in all states and the district of columbia 
although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives can impact the industry 
the authority of state insurance departments extends to various matters  including the establishment of standards of solvency  which must be met and maintained by insurers  the licensing of insurers and agents  the imposition of restrictions on investments  approval and regulation of premium rates and policy forms for property and casualty insurance  the payment of dividends and distributions  the provisions which insurers must make for current losses and future liabilities  and the deposit of securities for the benefit of policyholders 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial and business affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies 
regulatory agencies require that premium rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in general  the corporation s insurance subsidiaries must file all rates for personal and commercial insurance with the insurance department of each state in which they operate 
state laws also regulate insurance holding company systems 
each insurance holding company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers 
pursuant to these laws  the respective departments may examine the parent and the insurance subsidiaries at any time and require prior approval or notice of various transactions including dividends or distributions to the parent from the subsidiary domiciled in that state 
these state laws also require prior notice or regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company and of other material transfers of assets within the holding company structure 
under applicable provisions of indiana and ohio insurance statutes  the states in which the members of the group are domiciled  a person would not be permitted to acquire direct or indirect control of the corporation or any of its insurance subsidiaries  unless that person had obtained prior approval of the indiana insurance commissioner and the ohio superintendent of insurance 
for the purposes of indiana and ohio insurance laws  any person acquiring more than of the voting securities of a company is presumed to have acquired control of that company

national association of insurance commissioners naic the group s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the general statutory accounting practices and reporting formats established by the naic 
the naic also promulgates model insurance laws and regulations relating to the financial condition and operations of insurance companies  including the insurance regulating information system 
naic model laws and rules are not usually applicable unless enacted into law or promulgated into regulation by the individual states 
the adoption of naic model laws and regulations is a key aspect of the naic financial regulations standards and accreditation program  which also sets forth minimum staffing and resource levels for all state insurance departments 
ohio and indiana are accredited 
the naic intends to create a nationwide regulatory network of accredited states 
the naic has developed a risk based capital model for property and casualty insurers 
the model is used to establish standards  which relate insurance company statutory surplus to risks of operations and assist regulators in determining solvency requirements 
the standards are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholders 
the risk based capital model measures the following four major areas of risk to which property and casualty insurers are exposed asset and liability risk  credit risk  underwriting risk  and off balance sheet risk 
the risk based capital model law requires the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
based upon their statutory financial statements  the company and each of its insurance subsidiaries had the following ratio of total adjusted capital to the authorized control level the company american fire ohio security  west american avomark  ocnj as of december   all insurance companies in the group exceeded the necessary statutory capital requirements 
item continued regulations on dividends the corporation is dependent on dividend payments from its insurance subsidiaries in order to meet operating expenses  debt obligations and to pay dividends 
insurance regulatory authorities impose various restrictions and prior approval requirements on the payment of dividends by insurance companies and holding companies

management s discussion and analysis md a of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition of the corporation and the group as of december   compared with december  and december  and the corporation s and the group s results of operations for each of the three years 
the supplementary financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of the results of operations and financial position 
critical accounting policies management of the corporation has identified the policies listed below as significant accounting policies that are critical to the corporation s business operations and influence the consolidated results of operations and financial performance 
the policies listed below were selected as they require a higher degree of complexity or use subjective judgements or assessments 
these policies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
a brief summary of each critical accounting policy follows 
for a complete discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see footnote on pages through of this form k 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the group establishes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae equal to the estimated amount to settle both reported case reserves and unreported claims incurred but not yet reported  ibnr 
for reported losses  a case reserve is established within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy 
for ibnr losses  reserves are estimated using established actuarial methods 
an estimate of the loss and lae for each claim is developed using the facts in each case  the group s experience with similar cases  the effects of current developments and anticipated trends 
the methods and assumptions of making such estimates are continually reviewed and updated when considered appropriate 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the period in which such estimates are changed 
reserves established in prior years are adjusted as loss experience develops and new information becomes available 
adjustments to previously estimated reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are made and are referred to as prior period development 
because of the high degree of uncertainty involved in estimating loss and lae reserves  revisions to estimated reserves could have a material impact on the results of operations of the group 
investments all investment securities are classified upon acquisition as held to maturity or available for sale 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost because management has the ability and positive intent to hold the securities until maturity 
available for sale securities are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and asset liability management strategies  among others 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a component of comprehensive income  net of deferred tax 
transfers of fixed maturity securities into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category are made at fair value at the date of transfer 
the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held to maturity securities 
such amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the security 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values item continued and include non redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks 
the difference between cost and quoted market value  net of deferred taxes  is classified as other comprehensive income 
the corporation and the group closely monitor their fixed maturity and equity portfolios for declines in value that are deemed to be other than temporary 
the portfolios are regularly evaluated based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other specific developments 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  the corporation and the group recognize a realized loss and the security is written down to its estimated fair value 
mortgage backed securities are amortized over a period based on estimated future principal payments  including prepayments 
prepayment assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect actual prepayments and changes in expectations 
upon receipt of payments from such securities  the corporation and the group determine the appropriate amount of the funds to be allocated as a reduction of principal and interest income 
in making this allocation decision  investment personnel consider such factors as the original estimated average life of the investment  the amount of funds received to date and the timing of future cash flows 
variations from prepayment assumptions will affect the life and yield of these securities 
these securities are evaluated for impairment by computing the net present value of expected future cash flows and comparing this to the prior period estimate of expected future cash flows from the security 
when the timing and or amount of cash expected to be received from the security has changed materially and adversely from the previous valuation  the security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated fair value with a realized loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
deferred policy acquisition costs the group establishes a deferred asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring property and casualty business 
the acquisition costs deferred consist of commissions  brokerage fees  salaries and benefits and other underwriting expenses to include allocations for inspections  taxes  rent and other expenses that vary directly with the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are amortized over the life of the underlying policies 
quarterly  an analysis of the asset is performed in relation to the expected recognition of revenues including investment income to determine if any deficiency exists 
no deficiencies have been indicated for the periods presented 
agent relationships the corporation and the group have recorded an asset  which it refers to as agent relationships  for the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the great american insurance company gai commercial lines acquisition 
the corporation and the group followed the practice of allocating purchase price to specifically identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated values as determined by appropriate valuation models 
the agent relationships asset is amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of twenty five years 
the estimated useful life was based on the group s actual experience for agency appointment terms for similar agents  which averaged approximately twenty five years in length 
the corporation and the group evaluate the estimated useful life on an annual basis or as events or circumstances arise that may impact the useful life of the asset 
the asset is evaluated quarterly as events or circumstances  such as cancellation of agents  indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
cancellation of certain agents for reasons such as lack of revenue production or poor quality of business produced does not necessarily change the estimated useful life of the remaining agents representing the agent relationships intangible asset 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on existing company businesses 
the analyses involve significant management judgments to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
if future undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the item continued carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in income in the period in which the future cash flows are identified to be insufficient in comparison to the carrying amount of the asset 
the corporation and the group anticipate that based on future events or circumstances additional write downs for impairment will be made in future periods 
internally developed software in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software 
these costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
costs such as maintenance  training  data conversion  overhead and general and administrative are expensed as incurred 
management believes the expected future cash flows of the asset exceed the carrying value 
the expected future cash flows are determined using various assumptions and estimates 
changes in these assumptions could result in an immediate impairment to the asset and a corresponding charge to net income 
the costs associated with the software are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years commencing when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
executive level overview the corporation earns revenue by providing businesses and consumers with competitive insurance products with high quality service and by income on funds invested 
this year the corporation achieved meaningful improvement in financial performance 
net income increased in compared to as a result of a better priced book of business through realization of double digit price increases in certain lines and an improved risk profile as a result of tighter underwriting standards 
the statutory expense ratio continued to improve as a result of expense management initiatives 
the year ended with a strong capital position and the highest level of statutory policyholders surplus since the all lines statutory combined ratio improved to compared to in as a result of lower underwriting expenses and lower lae 
these results for were slightly higher than the expected range due primarily to an increase in reserves for environmental claims in the fourth quarter of  higher than expected catastrophe losses and large non catastrophe property losses 
although full year premiums are below last year s levels  the group s risk profile has improved 
the decline in net premiums written for the full year reflects personal lines withdrawal from selected markets  stricter underwriting guidelines for commercial lines  including the non renewal of certain construction defect related risks  stricter underwriting of workers compensation risks in several states and higher reinsurance costs  primarily for the commercial umbrella product line 
besides improving the group s risk profile in  the group also focused on reducing expenses through a cost structure efficiency program 
some of the specific areas that were addressed include more effective management of claims litigation efforts  improved procurement practices  including a reduction in telecommunications expenses  the use of emerging technologies to streamline  simplify and speed up processes and management of staff levels  including a steady reduction in employee count and a focus on increased skills training to improve products and services 
in the fourth quarter of a new phase of the cost structure efficiency program was initiated 
this new phase focuses on process improvements  increased productivity and appropriate staffing to deliver high levels of service to agents and policyholders 
as a result of company wide process reengineering initiatives  the corporation announced on february  an immediate staff and managerial position reduction with an additional reduction of positions expected to be announced by the end of item continued the second quarter of the reduction of positions will result in net savings of approximately million before tax in and annual savings of million before tax beginning in the corporation will record in the first quarter of approximately million before tax for severance and other related expenses for the positions reduced 
as part of its strategic planning process  the corporation evaluated insurance industry trends over the past couple of years 
these trends show some insurance companies performing at combined ratios in the to range with lower investment income due to lower market yields 
in addition  the industry took less aggressive price increases in in most insurance product lines and an increased focus on the quality of reinsurers 
recognizing that improved industry results may mean increased price competition  the corporation has taken steps in to achieve improved profitability through expense reduction initiatives while maintaining quality underwriting and pricing 
during  much of the focus will be on driving operational efficiencies and expense reductions throughout the organization 
the reduction in personnel is expected to result in expense savings in the near future 
management acknowledges that the reengineering activities may cause disruptions to operations and has proactively taken actions to mitigate this risk 
in september  the corporation announced its corporate strategic plan for the time frame 
the plan brings together five broad objectives to help achieve the corporation s vision to be a leading super regional property and casualty carrier providing a broad range of products services through independent agents and brokers 
the broad objectives include abilities to generate above market real growth  produce competitive loss ratios  create a competitive expense structure  achieve a competitive return on equity and improve credit ratings and financial flexibility 
competitive advantages include strong agency relationships  especially with key agents  and technology platforms that provide operating flexibility 
technology is being leveraged to make it easier for agents to do business with the group and to increase pricing and underwriting sophistication 
the key financial indicators management utilizes consist of statutory combined ratios and component ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis  gross and net written premium growth  impact of catastrophes  renewal price increases and investment income growth 
results of operations net income the corporation reported net income of million  or per share  compared with a net loss of 
million  or 
per share  for the year  and net income of million  or per share  in management of the corporation believes the significant volatility of realized investment gains and losses limits the usefulness of net income as a measure of current operating performance 
management uses the non gaap financial measure of net income before realized gains and losses to further evaluate current operating performance 
net income before realized gains and losses is reconciled to net income in the table below item continued reconciliation of net income loss before realized gains and losses in millions net income loss before realized gains and losses after tax realized gains and losses net income loss the improved financial results for are the result of expense reductions and an improved loss ratio 
decreases in personnel and sales related expenses led to the improved results for compared with staff reductions of in compared to were the result of the claim department reorganization and the lexington and indianapolis underwriting offices being consolidated into other locations 
additional savings are anticipated to occur in as additional workflow re engineering will occur in the first half of the loss ratio improvement in is due to tighter underwriting standards and an improved risk profile 
in addition  development on prior accident years losses and lae decreased million before tax from to million before tax in during  the increase in provision for prior accident years losses and lae totaled million before tax and was concentrated in the general liability  commercial auto and personal auto product lines 
these improved results were offset by increased catastrophe losses during the catastrophe losses before tax more than doubled to million in from million in resulting from storms that swept through the midwest and the effects of hurricane isabel 
results in were also favorably impacted as a result of reduced costs associated with the agent relationships identifiable intangible asset 
in  the before tax amortization and impairment costs were million compared with million in and million in this asset represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets for the acquisition of the gai commercial lines division 
the impairment charges occurred when estimated future cash flows of certain agents were less than the carrying value 
at december   the largest individual agent asset carrying value is million  which represents the maximum future impairment charge for an individual agent 
based upon historical performance of this agent  it is unlikely the agent will become impaired or cancelled in the near term 
for the approximately individual agents that represent the total agent relationships intangible asset  the average asset carrying value as of december  is 
million 
the larger than usual impairment charge in the third quarter of was due primarily to the recognition that certain agents experienced sustained premium revenue trends that were significantly different from prior estimates  resulting in changes in estimated future cash flows for those agents 
the determination of impairment involves the use of management estimates and assumptions 
due to the inherent uncertainties and judgments involved in making these assumptions and the fact that the asset cannot be increased for any agent  further reductions in the valuation of the agent relationship asset are likely to occur in the future and could be significant based on uncertainties such as changes in an agent s revenue production or profitability 
in  results were negatively impacted by the losses and lae for prior accident years as described above 
the majority of the charge  million before tax  occurred in the third quarter and was primarily related to construction defect claims for residential developers and contractors 
the group continues to address this specific type of business for non renewal 
for further discussion  refer to the loss and loss adjustment expenses section under liquidity and financial strength 
net income for was negatively impacted by prior accident year adverse development in the group s workers compensation product line and asbestos related claims as well as the impact of an early retirement plan 
during the fourth quarter of  a member of the group  ohio casualty of new jersey  inc ocnj  entered into an agreement to transfer its obligations to renew private item continued passenger auto business in new jersey to proformance insurance company proformance 
in recent years  the market in new jersey private passenger auto had become unstable due to the inability to control both the volume of writings and the profitability 
the group decided to eliminate future uncertainty and risks related to the new jersey private passenger automobile market in order to achieve its long term strategic objectives 
management determined that it was uncertain whether profitability would return to the new jersey private passenger auto business  as there were indications that some insurance companies were receiving premium rate increase approval from regulators while others were not 
the group s inability to determine the future impact of insurance reform legislation created additional uncertainty 
both premium rate increases and insurance reform legislation might have returned ocnj s private passenger auto business to profitability  but it was uncertain as to if and when that would occur 
as a result  the group concluded that it was prudent to pay a fee to transfer the obligation to renew ocnj s new jersey private passenger auto policies in order to eliminate the future uncertainty associated with that business 
the transaction allowed the group to stop writing private passenger auto business in new jersey beginning in march of under the terms of the transaction  ocnj agreed to pay million to proformance to transfer its renewal obligations 
the before tax amount of million was charged to income in the fourth quarter of  reducing net income by million on an after tax basis 
the contract stipulates that a premiums to surplus ratio of to must be maintained on the transferred business during the three year period beginning march the final measurement date is december  and will include use of the statutory insurance expense exhibit which is due april  if this criteria is not met  ocnj will have to pay up to million to proformance to maintain this premiums to surplus ratio 
at december   the group evaluated the contingency based upon financial data provided by proformance and concluded that a payment is not probable  and has not recognized a liability in the financial statements 
the group will continue to monitor the contingency for possible future liability recognition 
during  loss and lae reserves for prior accident years were strengthened by million before tax for the workers compensation product line and million before tax for asbestos related claims development in other product lines 
also in  the corporation adopted an early retirement plan that impacted employees and resulted in a one time after tax charge of million 
investment results consolidated before tax net investment income was million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in consolidated before tax net investment income of million is attributable to an increase in investment assets held  partially offset by increased investment expenses attributable to the implementation of a new investment accounting system  lower average yields on its fixed income portfolio  and increased investment management fees from expanded use of outside investment managers 
as part of a conversion to a new investment accounting system in  million before tax expense was recorded for a change in accounting estimate relating to amortization of interest only mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
offsetting most of this charge was a million credit for interest received on a federal income tax settlement 
the decrease in investment income of million before tax in was attributable to the significant decline in reinvestment rates on fixed maturity investments 
this decline in rates in was partially offset by increased investment in fixed maturities following the reallocation of the equity portfolio in and the reallocation in the investment portfolio reduced holdings of equity securities and increased holdings of investment grade fixed maturity securities 
after tax investment income totaled million in compared with million in and million in item continued consolidated before tax realized net investment gains amounted to million in  million in and million in throughout and equity securities were sold  many of which had substantially appreciated in value in earlier periods 
these sales were part of a program to reduce exposure to the market volatility of equity securities 
during and  there were no significant realized losses on sales of securities 
in  a loss of approximately million before tax was realized on the sale of fixed maturity securities issued by enron corporation 
these securities had been purchased in prior periods and were sold both prior and subsequent to enron corporation s filing for bankruptcy in december prior to  these securities were not in an unrealized loss position 
in the first quarter of  management decided to transfer a portion of its fixed maturity securities from the available for sale classification into the held to maturity classification 
this transfer was made as the corporation and the group have both the ability to hold the securities to maturity and the positive intent to do so 
at december   the amortized cost of the held to maturity portfolio was million 
invested assets comprise a majority of the consolidated assets 
consequently  accounting policies related to investments are critical 
see further discussion of important investment accounting policies in the critical accounting policies section and in footnote c on page of this form k 
the corporation and the group continually evaluate all of their investments based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other developments 
the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of investments is continually evaluated to determine whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary in nature 
this determination involves a degree of uncertainty 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be temporary  the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss in shareholders equity 
if there is a decline in a security s fair value that is considered to be other than temporary  the security is written down to the estimated fair value with a corresponding realized loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the assessment of whether a decline in fair value is considered temporary or other than temporary includes management s judgement as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity issuing the security 
it is not possible to accurately predict when it may be determined that a specific security will become impaired 
future impairment charges could be material to the results of operations 
the amount of impairment charge before tax was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the impairment charge represents 
of the market value at december   and  respectively of the investment portfolio 
during  certain amr corporation and delta air lines  inc fixed maturity investments were written down by million and million  respectively 
the write down amounts were determined by the difference between fair value and cost of the securities at the time of the write down 
management determined that these securities have an other than temporary impairment of value based on its review  which is described above 
management believes that it will recover the cost basis in the securities held with unrealized losses as it has both the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
securities are sold to achieve management s investment goals  which include the diversification of credit risk  the maintenance of adequate portfolio liquidity  a competitive investment yield and the management of interest rate risk 
in order to achieve these goals  sales of investments are based upon current market conditions  liquidity needs and estimates of the future market value of the individual securities 
the following tables summarize for all available for sale securities and held to maturity securities  the total gross unrealized losses  excluding gross unrealized gains  by investment category and length of time the securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of december  item continued available for sale with unrealized losses in millions less than months months or longer total fair value unrealized fair value unrealized fair value unrealized losses losses losses securities us government

as part of the evaluation of the entire million aggregate unrealized loss on the investment portfolio  management performed a more intensive review of securities with a relatively higher degree of unrealized loss 
based on a review of each security  management believes that unrealized losses on these securities were temporary declines in value at december  in the table above  there are approximately securities represented 
of this total  securities have unrealized loss positions greater than of their market values at december  with none exceeding 
this group represents million  or of the total unrealized loss position 
of this group  securities representing approximately million in unrealized losses have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
of the remaining nine securities in an unrealized loss position for longer than twelve months totaling million  management believes that they will recover the cost basis of these securities  and have both the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
all securities are monitored by portfolio managers who consider many factors such as an issuer s degree of financial flexibility  management competence and industry fundamentals in evaluating whether the decline in fair value is temporary 
in addition  management considers whether it is probable that all contract terms of the security will be satisfied and whether the unrealized loss position is due to changes in the interest rate environment 
should management item continued subsequently conclude the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the book value of the security is written down to fair value with the realized loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the amortized cost and estimated fair value of available for sale and held to maturity fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position at december   by contractual maturity are shown below

although the terrorist events of september  had a significant impact on the reinsurance market  the group s reinsurance contracts continue to include coverage for acts of terrorism 
instead of being unlimited as in the past  terrorism coverage in the contracts was modified to exclude or limit coverage for certain upper layers of reinsurance 
the group believes that the terrorism coverage in its reinsurance programs is adequate to protect its financial health 
the group has renewed its reinsurance programs for except for the bond reinsurance treaty that is expected to be renewed at the april  expiration date 
the program maintains a million loss retention level for most risks  but the property per risk treaty has a million loss retention level 
in addition  beginning in  the group retains percent of all umbrella losses applicable to the million excess of million layer 
the top layer of the property catastrophe treaty was reduced from million excess of million to million excess of million  reflecting reduced exposure for personal lines of business 
pricing for the program reflected flat pricing for the property treaties on average and double digit increases for the casualty treaties on average 
internally developed software in  the group introduced into limited production an internally developed software application for issuing and maintaining insurance policies named parissm  a policy administration  rating and issuance system 
during  the group began capitalizing application development costs associated with the personal lines segment  which are expected to begin roll out in and continued capitalization for the specialty lines segment which are expected to be rolled out beginning in during  the group substantially completed the rollout for the commercial lines operating segment 
a rollout begins when the application has been placed into service for one or more states for an individual major product line and ends when the application is placed into service item continued for the final state 
the rollout period can exceed one year for an individual major product line 
the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage  primarily relating to payroll and payroll related costs for employees  along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
the cost associated with this application is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years from the date placed into service with before tax amortization expense of million  million and 
million for  and  respectively 
upon full implementation of all major product lines  the new application should impact results by approximately million to million before tax per year in amortization expense until capitalized internally developed software costs including parissm and other internally developed software and accumulated amortization are summarized in the table below in millions cost accumulated amortization carrying value management believes the carrying value of the asset is appropriate 
the useful life of the internally developed software was determined by using certain assumptions and estimates 
inherent changes in these assumptions could result in an immediate impairment to the asset and a corresponding charge to net income 
the group periodically reviews the asset for impairment as events or circumstances arise that may affect the carrying value 
statutory results management uses statutory financial criteria to analyze the group s property and casualty results and insurance industry regulators require the group to report statutory financial measures 
management analyzes statutory results through the use of insurance industry financial measures including statutory loss and lae ratios  statutory underwriting expense ratio  statutory combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the statutory combined ratio is a commonly used gauge of underwriting performance measuring the percentages of premium dollars used to pay insurance losses and related expenses 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio  the loss adjustment expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
all references to combined ratio or its components in the md a are calculated on a statutory accounting basis and are calculated on a calendar year basis unless specified as calculated on an accident year basis 
a discussion of the differences between statutory accounting and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states is included in footnote on pages and of this form k 
insurance industry financial measures are included in the next several sections of this md a that discuss results of operations 
statutory surplus  a financial measure that is required by insurance regulators and used to monitor financial strength  is discussed in the statutory surplus section of the liquidity and financial strength portion of this md a 
all lines discussion statutory net premiums written decreased million in to  million 
the decline in statutory net premiums written over reflects the group s efforts to restructure its risk profile as personal lines withdrew from select markets and commercial lines implemented stricter underwriting guidelines  including the non renewal of certain construction defect related risks 
in addition  the decline in net premiums written from last year also reflects the impact of higher reinsurance costs 
net premiums written totaled  million in and  million in the slight decline of net premiums written in when compared to is primarily attributable to the reduction in premiums related to the non renewal of the group s new jersey private passenger auto business which began to be non renewed in march of item continued the group s business is geographically concentrated in the mid west and mid atlantic regions 
the following table shows consolidated net premiums written for the group s five largest states all lines net premiums written distributed by top states new jersey ohio pennsylvania kentucky illinois new jersey is the group s largest state with of the total net premiums written during in recent years  new jersey s legislative and regulatory environments for private passenger automobile insurance have become less favorable to the insurance industry 
the state requires insurance companies to accept all risks that meet underwriting guidelines for private passenger automobile while rigidly controlling the rates charged 
in the fourth quarter of  ocnj entered into an agreement to transfer its new jersey private passenger auto renewal obligations to proformance 
this transaction allowed the group to stop writing business in the new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella markets in early the all lines combined ratio improved points to in  compared with in and in an improved underwriting expense ratio and lower losses and lae contributed to the all lines combined ratio improvement in the combined ratio benefited from a reduction in personnel and sales related expenses 
these two items  somewhat offset by increased expenses for technology including amortization of internally developed software  contributed to the 
point reduction in the underwriting expense ratio from in to in the loss and lae ratio decreased points from in to in the loss and lae ratio was impacted by million and million of before tax prior accident year reserve development in and  respectively  which added points and points to the and all lines combined ratio  respectively 
the remaining improvement of points in the loss and lae ratio over was due to significant improvement in the personal lines loss ratio primarily related to the withdrawal from new jersey personal auto and a decrease in non catastrophe experience for the personal property product lines 
the all lines combined ratio improved points in compared to due primarily to improvement in the personal lines and commercial lines loss and lae ratio 
the positive improvements resulted from tighter underwriting standards  lower catastrophe losses and large losses offset by increases in loss and lae reserves due to adverse prior years development  primarily related to construction defect losses 
the loss and lae ratios were impacted negatively in  and by adjustments to estimated losses related to prior years business 
the loss and lae ratio components of the accident year combined ratio measures losses and lae arising from insured events that occurred in the respective accident year 
the current accident year excludes losses and lae for insured events that occurred in prior accident years

item continued the table below summarizes the impact of changes in provision for all prior accident year losses and lae in millions statutory net liabilities  beginning of period    increase in provision for prior accident year claims increase in provision for prior accident year claims as of premiums earned in  the impact of this adverse development for prior accident years losses and lae was concentrated in the commercial multi peril product line of the commercial lines operating segment and in the personal auto product line of the personal lines operating segment 
the commercial umbrella product line experienced significant favorable development for prior years losses and lae  primarily due to a reduction in estimated future costs for claims adjuster related expenses 
the total provision for prior years losses and lae of million before tax represents of loss and lae reserves as of year end the comparable amount of provision for prior years losses and lae recognized during the year was million before tax representing of loss and lae reserves as of year end this was concentrated in the commercial auto and general liability product lines of the commercial lines operating segment 
the comparable amount for provisions for prior years losses and lae recognized during the year was million before tax 
this represents of loss and lae reserves as of year end this was concentrated primarily in the workers compensation and general liability product lines 
the combined ratio includes a reallocation of lae reserve estimates related to claims adjuster salaries  benefits and similar costs from the commercial and specialty lines segments to the personal lines segment 
this increased the personal lines segment combined ratio by points and decreased the commercial and specialty lines segments combined ratios by 
points and points  respectively 
catastrophe losses in totaled million  compared with million in and million in the group was impacted by separate catastrophes in  compared with catastrophes in and in catastrophe losses added points to the combined ratio in  compared with points in and points in the effects of catastrophes on the corporation s results cannot be accurately predicted 
as such  severe weather patterns  acts of war or terrorist activities could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s results  reinsurance pricing and availability of reinsurance

points in to compared with in and in the underwriting expense ratio was favorably impacted by a reduction in employee related costs and lower sales related expenses as a percentage of premiums  and was partially offset by higher expenses related to investments in technology 
sales related expenses for included the resumption of a ceding commission for certain layers of commercial umbrella reinsurance and also agent bonus commission levels more similar to years prior to the employee count continued to decline in with an decline over  resulting in part from claim staff reorganization and underwriting facility consolidations 
the employee count was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
the underwriting expense ratio for the year decreased compared to due primarily to the impact of points related to the million new jersey transfer fee 
the year underwriting expense ratio experienced upward pressure due to two factors with a total impact of approximately points 
these two factors were the non renewal of the new jersey private passenger auto business  which had lower commission rates and lower variable processing costs than most other business and the elimination of ceding commissions received in previous years on umbrella premiums ceded to reinsurers 
the commission expense ratio  a component of the underwriting expense ratio  was at a relatively high level due to higher than expected umbrella net premiums written  which had a relatively high commission rate on a net of reinsurance basis and to higher than expected accruals for agent bonus commissions 
the  and statutory underwriting expenses also included million  million and 
million of software amortization expense before tax  respectively  related to the rollout of parissm  a new internally developed software application 
on a statutory accounting basis  the new application is being amortized over a five year period compared to ten year period under gaap in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
during  the group substantially completed the rollout of the new application for the commercial lines segment 
during  the group began capitalizing application development costs associated with the personal lines segment which are expected to begin rollout in the specialty lines segment is on target for rollout in the beginning of upon full implementation  the impact on statutory expenses is expected to be approximately million to million in annual amortization expense before tax through the additional cost is expected to be offset in part by reduced labor costs related to underwriting and policy processing 
segment discussion in june of  the corporation introduced an organizational structure around three business units commercial lines  specialty lines  and personal lines 
these business units represent the corporation s operating segments as well as its reportable segments 
within each operating segment are distinct insurance product lines that generate revenues by selling a variety of personal  commercial  and surety insurance products 
the commercial lines operating segment sells commercial multiple peril  commercial auto  general liability and workers compensation insurance as its primary products 
the specialty lines operating segment sells commercial umbrella  excess item continued insurance and fidelity and surety insurance as its primary products 
the personal lines operating segment sells personal automobile and homeowners insurance as its primary products 
the corporation also has an all other segment  which derives its revenue from investment income and premium financing 
the following tables provide key financial measures for each of the property and casualty reportable segments commercial lines segment in millions net premiums written net premiums earned loss ratio loss expense ratio underwriting expense ratio specialty lines segment in millions net premiums written net premiums earned loss ratio loss expense ratio underwriting expense ratio personal lines segment in millions net premiums written net premiums earned loss ratio loss expense ratio underwriting expense ratio commercial lines segment the commercial lines combined ratio for the year decreased points to from in the improvement in the combined ratio occurred in spite of points of adverse development on loss and lae reserves primarily in the workers compensation and commercial multiple peril product lines 
the combined ratio improved from to by points 
this improvement was less than expected due to million of adverse development in loss and lae reserves from prior years adding points to the combined ratio 
of this amount  approximately million related to construction defect issues which added points to the combined ratio for renewal price increases had a positive impact during  and the average renewal price increase was for commercial lines direct premiums written  compared with and average renewal price increases in and  respectively 
the average renewal price increase is lower than in prior years due to a broad trend indicating that commercial lines policies are approaching price adequacy and competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace are increasing 
when used in this report  renewal price increase means the average increase in premium for policies renewed by the group 
the average increase in premiums for each renewed policy is calculated by comparing the total expiring premium for the policy with the total renewal premium for the same policy 
renewal price increases include  among other things  the effects of rate increases and changes in the underlying insured exposures of the policy 
only policies issued by the group in the previous policy term with the same policy identification codes are included 
therefore  renewal price increases do not include changes in premiums for newly issued policies and business assumed through reinsurance agreements  including great american business not yet issued in the group s systems 
renewal price increases also do not reflect the cost of any reinsurance purchased on the policies issued 
item continued commercial lines results for included higher than expected catastrophe losses and large non catastrophe losses compared to catastrophe losses added points in to the commercial lines combined ratio  compared to points in and point in large non catastrophe losses related to current accident year losses measured as of december added points  points and points to the combined ratio for  and  respectively 
the workers compensation product line combined ratio decreased points in to  despite points of adverse prior years loss and lae reserve development  points of which was due to increased reserves on two lifetime workers compensation claims 
although this line continues to experience adverse development on prior accident years  the combined ratio has decreased for the third year in a row 
in  the combined ratio decreased points to  compared to in the loss ratio was the main component driving the high combined ratios in all three years 
the workers compensation loss ratio was compared to in and in adverse development of prior year losses due to an increase in claims severity contributed to the poor results for all three years 
the accident year loss ratio of was points lower than the calendar year loss ratio 
the and accident year loss ratios were and  respectively  which were points and points lower than the respective calendar year loss ratios 
although the group has taken actions to improve workers compensation results  including a more conservative underwriting appetite in states where there is rate inadequacy despite the attainment of double digit renewal increases for the year  the product line continues to be negatively impacted by assessments for the national workers compensation residual market pool 
the impact of the national workers compensation residual market pool added points to the workers compensation combined ratio in  compared to points in and decreased the ratio points in the group continued to achieve average renewal price increases for workers compensation of for  compared with increases of and for and  respectively 
net premiums written for  and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
the continued decrease in net premiums written for workers compensation is the result of the group s initiative to responsibly price and underwrite this product line in order to make the line more profitable 
the commercial auto product line net premiums written increased million or to million in during  net premiums written for this line increased million  or to million  compared with million in the  and increases were driven by renewal price increases  averaging  and  respectively 
the commercial auto combined ratio improved points to compared to in this improvement is largely due to improved underwriting  the effect of renewal price increases and less adverse loss and lae reserve development from prior years

the accident year combined ratio for was compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in the accident year combined ratio is a result of higher severity for this line of business 
the difference between the accident and calendar year results in is primarily due to increases in residential general contractors and developers related construction defect reserves established for prior accident years due to greater than expected frequency and loss severity 
the construction defect issues are being addressed by continuing and expanding previous underwriting actions on certain classes of business that are more prone to construction defect claims

b the group exited the new jersey private passenger automobile market in march which was completed in march the combined ratio in for new jersey personal auto is larger than normal due to prior year loss development in relation to significantly reduced premium levels from this business 
item continued specialty lines segment specialty lines combined ratio for improved points to compared to and for and  respectively 
the improvement in the combined ratio is due primarily to overall favorable development on prior accident year loss and lae reserves of million compared to favorable development in of million and adverse development of million in the fidelity and surety product lines in the specialty lines segment contributed to the favorable results for this segment 
fidelity and surety net premiums written decreased slightly to million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
despite lower net premiums written in  the combined ratio improved to in  compared with in and in the improvement in the fidelity and surety combined ratio was the result of favorable development on prior accident year loss and lae reserves of million and overall lower losses for this product line 
during the fourth quarter of  there was a return of ceded premium of million before tax for the fidelity and surety business in the specialty lines operating segment 
this return of ceded premium was due to the exercise of a contractual option on the bond reinsurance treaty based on highly favorable bond combined ratios over the past fourteen years 
net premiums written for the commercial umbrella product line decreased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in higher reinsurance costs in  driven by the addition of a ceding commission and by increased reinsurance rates per dollar of premium  had a negative impact on net premiums written 
the addition of ceding commissions on the current reinsurance contract causes a corresponding increase to ceded premiums 
average renewal price increases were  compared to in and in the combined ratio was compared to and in and  respectively 
the improved combined ratio in was largely attributable to favorable development on prior accident year loss and lae reserves due largely to a reduction in estimated future costs for commercial umbrella claims adjuster related expenses that favorably impacted the specialty lines combined ratio by points 
personal lines segment the personal lines combined ratio for decreased points to compared to in and in every product line in the personal lines operating segment registered an improved combined ratio in compared to the improvement is driven by the withdrawal from new jersey private passenger auto market which began in  premium rate increases  a significant improvement in the non catastrophe experience for homeowners and a decline in the underwriting expense ratio 
the point improvement in is attributable to the implementation of price increases  insurance scoring  enhanced claims management procedures  withdrawal from states that have proven unprofitable and lower than average losses from catastrophes 
the group continued to narrow its geographic focus in personal lines during the group has received all necessary approvals from regulators to withdraw its personal lines business from florida  georgia and texas 
these three states contributed approximately million to net premiums written in personal lines excluding new jersey private passenger auto results and the effects of the withdrawal states and cancelled agents would have grown by approximately in the group does not write any lines of business in california 
net premiums written for private passenger auto decreased in by million to million compared to million in and million in this product line has decreased  as expected  due to the group s strategy to withdraw from certain states 
agency cancellations also contributed to the decline in premiums in  and the combined ratio for private item continued passenger auto improved during by points to compared to in and in the group is implementing price increases and claims management procedures to further improve results 
given the unfavorable regulatory environment and uncertainty over the future profitability for private passenger auto in new jersey  the group announced in the fourth quarter of the transaction to allow the group in early to stop writing private passenger auto business in new jersey 
the transaction  described in the results of operations net income section  has allowed the group to complete its exit from the new jersey personal lines auto market in early new jersey s private passenger auto net premiums written represented approximately of the group s total private passenger auto book of business in  compared to in new jersey regulation mandates private passenger automobile insurers in the state to provide insurance to all eligible consumers with limited exceptions 
this take all comers regulation eliminated the group s ability to control the volume and selection of writings in the state 
poor underwriting results in new jersey contributed to the poor performance in and the new jersey private passenger auto results added and points to the and personal lines loss ratio  respectively 
homeowners product line net premiums written increased in to million compared to million in and million in the group has placed emphasis on price increases  coverage restrictions  insurance scoring and agency management 
average implemented rate increases were  and in  and  respectively 
the homeowners combined ratio decreased points to compared to a point decrease in to 
this compares with a combined ratio of in the improvement in is attributable to improved underwriting discipline and aggressive pricing 
combined ratios are heavily impacted by catastrophe losses which added points to the combined ratio in  points in and points in liquidity and financial strength cash flow net cash generated from operations was million compared with cash generated of million in and million in the increase for the year compared to is due primarily to a million reduction in paid losses and lae as operating revenues for the two years were roughly equal 
this increase in cash was partially offset by an increase in payments to reinsurers for premium cessions  contingent commission bonus payments to agents and the final payments of the replacement carrier fee for new jersey private passenger auto business 
the increase in the reinsurance recoverable asset did not significantly impact cash flow in since there was a corresponding increase in liabilities for most of the increase in this asset 
the reinsurance recoverable asset increased million with million due to increases in loss reserves for future loss payments expected to be paid by reinsurers along with other components as shown in footnote on page of this form k 
the increase in reinsurance recoverables is due primarily to the group writing more commercial umbrella business  most of which the premiums and losses are ceded to reinsurers  resulting in an increase in the reinsurance recoverable asset and a corresponding increase in ceded loss  lae and unearned premium reserves 
the increase in cash generated from operations in was also due primarily to a reduction in paid losses and paid lae offset partially by payments of the replacement carrier fee for new jersey private passenger auto business 
item continued investing activities used net cash of million in  compared with net cash used of million in and million in the corporation and the group purchased fewer fixed maturity securities in as prepayments on mortgage backed securities were reduced in compared to  leaving less cash flow to reinvest 
proceeds from the sale of equity and fixed maturity securities also continues to decline as the corporation and the group are maintaining the current portfolio which contains primarily investment grade corporate and mortgage backed securities 
cash inflows from the sale of property and equipment increased over as the group sold a building located in lexington  kentucky including the related office equipment and land for sales proceeds of million 
total cash generated in financing activities was million in  compared to cash used of million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated by financing in resulted from the exercise of stock options partially offset by principal payments on the low interest rate loan from the state of ohio 
this compares to cash used for financing activities in  which included the repayment of the corporation s million credit facility and issuance of new convertible debt with net proceeds of million 
overall  total cash used in was million  compared to million in and cash generated of million in to further strengthen its financial position  the corporation did not pay any shareholder dividends for the years presented 
on a regular basis management analyzes the profitability and capital position of the group and the liquidity of the corporation  including the corporation s evaluation of whether to reinstitute a dividend to shareholders of the corporation or a share repurchase program 
the corporation is dependent on dividend payments from its insurance subsidiaries in order to meet operating expenses and debt obligations 
insurance regulatory authorities impose various restrictions and prior approval requirements on the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
as of december   approximately million of statutory surplus was not subject to prior dividend approval requirements 
additional restrictions may result from the minimum net worth and surplus requirements in the credit agreement as disclosed in footnote on pages and of this form k 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of december   and  the corporation did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by financial release  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations

the notes may be converted into common stock under certain conditions described in footnote on pages and of this form k and disclosed separately below 
excluded from other long term liabilities are pension obligations which are described in footnote on pages through of this form k and disclosed separately below 
also excluded are loss and lae reserves as the timing of payout is uncertain 
for further discussion on loss and lae reserves  refer to the loss and lae discussion below 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if certain criteria are met 
some provisions of fin require certain special purpose entity s spe to be consolidated as of december  the corporation does not have any investments that qualify as spe s under these provisions 
fin also requires consolidation of all variable interests held no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  as of march  for the corporation 
the corporation currently holds one equity investment  which represents a interest in the entity  which will require consolidation in accordance with fin the expected loss upon adoption will be immaterial to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
see footnote on page of this form k for further discussion 
debt as of december   the corporation had million of principal outstanding on debt that includes a million low interest loan with the state of ohio 
during the year  the corporation completed an offering of convertible notes  in an aggregate principal amount of million  due march  and generated net proceeds of million 
the issuance related costs are being amortized over the life of the notes and are being recorded as related fees 
the liability for debt is reported on the balance sheet net of the unamortized fees 
the corporation uses the effective interest rate method to record the interest and related fee amortization 
interest is payable on march and september of each year 
the notes may be converted into shares of the corporation s common stock under certain conditions  including if the price per share of the corporation s common stock reaches specific thresholds  if the credit rating of the notes is below a specified level or withdrawn  or if the notes have no credit rating during any period  or if specified corporate transactions have occurred 
the conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
if all outstanding notes are converted  the total outstanding common shares would increase by million shares 
the convertible debt impact on earnings per share is based on the if converted method 
the impact on diluted earnings per share is contingent on whether or not certain criteria have been met for conversion 
as of december   the common share price criterion had not been met and  therefore  no adjustment to the number of diluted shares on the earnings per share calculation was made for the convertible debt 
on or after item continued march   the corporation has the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted at the following redemption prices expressed as a percentage of principal amount during the twelve redemption months commencing price march  march  march  until maturity of the notes the holders of the notes have the option to require the corporation to purchase all or a portion of their notes on march of  and at of the principal amount of the notes 
in addition  upon a change in control of the corporation occurring anytime prior to maturity  holders may require the corporation to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
additionally  on july   the corporation entered into a revolving credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the lenders agreed to make loans to the corporation in an aggregate amount up to million for general corporate purposes 
the agreement requires the corporation to maintain minimum net worth of million 
the credit agreement also includes a minimum statutory surplus requirement for the ohio casualty insurance company of million 
additionally  other covenants and customary provisions are included in the agreement 
the corporation has not been in violation of the covenants contained in the agreement and does not foresee any difficulties in meeting the covenant requirements in the near future 
the corporation has not drawn on the revolver as of december  the credit agreement expires on march  and the corporation plans to either renew or replace the revolving credit facility 
prior to the expiration of the current revolver  the corporation will determine if the principal amount of the facility should be adjusted 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
the company considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns  interest rates and inflation in making these assumptions 
the company determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on the geometric method  which represents the average compound return of the plan assets 
plan assets are comprised primarily of investments in mutual funds  common stocks  corporate bonds  us government securities  real estate investment trusts and other investments 
the company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes and the expectations for future returns of each asset class when developing the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of the assumption for the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments on the plan s annual measurement date item continued september and is subject to change each year 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase  respectively  net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
unrecognized losses of approximately million are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the average future service period of active participants 
unrecognized gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized losses will be systematically recognized as an increase in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to fund the pension plan during the source for the funding will be cash flow from operating activities 
key assumptions used in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate used to determine the obligation for these benefits has matched the discount rate used in determining our pension obligations in each year presented 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
the company assumes that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was percent for  declining to percent in and thereafter 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and increase the postretirement benefit cost for by million 
likewise  decreasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the postretirement benefit cost for by million 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company in determining its pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the company announced changes to its defined benefit  defined contribution and health insurance plans 
the company s traditional defined benefit plan will be amended to freeze accrued benefits effective june  and to incorporate a new pension equity plan benefit formula beginning july also effective in july  eligibility for subsidized retiree medical and dental coverage will be restricted to then current retirees and employees with or more years of continuous service 
other employees will be eligible for access to unsubsidized retiree medical and dental coverage 
these changes will result in a decrease in expenses of approximately million before tax in and million before tax in when compared to the expense 
item continued in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  regarding the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma 
the fsp allows companies an opportunity to either assess the effect of mma on their retirement related benefit costs and obligations or to defer accounting for the effects of mma until authoritative guidance is issued 
the corporation has elected to defer accounting for the effects of mma  in accordance with the fsp 
the corporation does not expect the adoption of the fsp to have a material impact on the financial statements

rating agencies regularly the group s financial strength is reviewed by independent rating agencies 
these agencies may upgrade  downgrade  or affirm their previous ratings of the group 
these agencies may also place an outlook on the group s rating

the prospective ratings for senior unsecured debt  subordinated debt and preferred stock were bb  b and b  respectively 
on february  s p revised its outlook to stable and affirmed its financial strength and credit ratings on the group and the corporation 
item continued generally  credit ratings affect the cost and availability of debt financing 
often  borrowers with investment grade credit ratings can borrow at lower rates than those available to similarly situated companies with ratings that are below investment grade  and the availability of certain debt products may be greater for borrowers with investment grade credit ratings 
currently  the corporation is a split rated borrower  having investment grade ratings from am best  fitch and moody s and below investment grade credit rating from s p 
while influenced by conditions in the credit markets  it is reasonable to anticipate that the corporation s split rating will result in a higher cost of borrowing as compared to borrowers with only investment grade credit ratings 
the recent improvement in the rating outlook by s p is a positive development in the corporation s rating profile 
ohio casualty corporation quarterly high low market price per share first second third fourth high low high low high low statutory surplus statutory surplus  a traditional insurance industry measure of financial strength and underwriting capacity  was million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  statutory surplus increased from resulting principally from statutory net income and an increase in the market value of equity investments 
these positive factors were partially offset by million and million after tax charge in and  respectively for an increase in the additional minimum liability for the pension plan 
the decline in statutory surplus during was due primarily to a decrease in the market value of the equity investment portfolio 
statutory surplus benefited in from the sale of a minority interest in the stock of a subsidiary  which caused a tax benefit of million 
the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is one of the measures used by insurance regulators to gauge the financial strength of an insurance company and indicates the ability of the group to grow by writing additional business 
at december   the group s net premiums written to surplus ratio was to  compared to to in and to in the result is the strongest ratio for premiums to surplus since the national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurers and life insurers 
the formula is intended to measure the adequacy of an insurer s capital given the asset and liability structure and product mix of the company 
as of december   all insurance companies in the group exceeded the necessary capital requirements 
item continued reinsurance reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer  called a reinsurer  agrees to cover  under certain defined circumstances  a portion of the losses incurred by a primary insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the primary insurer 
the group purchases reinsurance to protect against large or catastrophic losses 
there are several programs that provide reinsurance coverage and the programs in effect for are summarized below 
the group s property per risk program covers property losses in excess of million for a single insured  for a single event 
this property per risk program covers up to million in losses in excess of the million retention level for a single event 
the group s casualty per occurrence program covers liability losses 
workers compensation  umbrella and other casualty reinsurance cover losses up to million  million and million  respectively  in excess of the million retention level for a single insured event 
the retention on the property per risk excess of loss treaty increased from million in to million in the casualty reinsurance treaty includes a layer of coverage of million in excess of million that consists of a fund managed by the group  and the group has title to the assets 
ceded premiums are paid by the group into the fund and reinsured losses are paid to the group under the terms of the reinsurance agreement with various reinsurers 
the reinsurers bear the risk of losses in excess of the fund 
the group s ability to manage the investments of the fund reduces credit risk related to reinsurers 
the balance of the fund as of december  was approximately million 
the property catastrophe reinsurance program protects the group against an accumulation of losses arising from one defined catastrophic occurrence or series of events 
this program provides million of coverage in excess of the group s million retention level 
the catastrophe excess of loss treaty changed from million in excess of million in to million in excess of million in the treaty was written on a multiple year basis for years with only a portion of the reinsurance layers expiring in a single year 
this provides continuity  maintains rates and preserves each reinsurer s share of the overall program 
over the last years  two events triggered coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
losses and lae from the fires in oakland  california in totaled million and losses and lae from hurricane andrew in totaled million 
both of these losses exceeded the prior retention amount of million  resulting in significant recoveries from reinsurers 
reinsurance limits are purchased to cover exposure to catastrophic events having the probability of occurring every years 
gai agreed to maintain reinsurance on the commercial lines business that the group acquired from gai and its affiliates in for loss dates prior to december  gai is obligated to reimburse the group if gai s reinsurers are unable to pay claims with respect to the acquired commercial lines business 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large base of reinsurers is utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
the group also records an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts as deemed necessary 
during the last three fiscal years  no reinsurer accounted for more than of total ceded premiums  excluding the security trust fund 
as a result of these controls  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
for more discussion on the reinsurance recoverable asset  see footnote on page of this form k 
item continued loss and loss adjustment expenses the group s largest liabilities are reserves for losses and lae 
the accounting policies related to the loss and lae reserves are considered critical 
loss and lae reserves are established for all incurred claims and are carried on an undiscounted basis before any credits for reinsurance recoverable 
actual losses and lae are adjusted upward or downward as new information is received 
these reserves amounted to billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  as of december   the reserves by operating segment were as follows billion commercial lines  
billion specialty lines and 
billion personal lines 
the group s actuaries conduct a reserve study using generally accepted actuarial methods each quarter from which point estimates of ultimate losses and lae by product line or coverage within product line are selected 
in selecting the point estimates  thousands of data points are reviewed and the judgment of the actuaries is applied broadly 
each quarter management records its best estimate of the liability for loss and lae reserves by considering the actuaries point estimates 
management s best estimate recognizes that there is uncertainty underlying the actuarial point estimates 
reasonable range estimates around the point estimates are used by management to validate its best estimate of the liability 
there are several key assumptions supporting the point estimate including those summarized below 
the fundamental assumption is that actuarial reserving methods  using historical loss experience organized by line of business  or coverage within line  and accident year at successive evaluation points  applied by experienced reserving actuaries  produces reasonable estimates of future loss development on prior insured events 
supporting assumptions internal to company operations are as follows recording of premium and loss statistics in the appropriate detail has been accurate and consistent  claims handling  including the recording of claims  payment and closure rates  and case reserving has been consistent  the quality of business written and the mix of business eg states  limits  coverages  and deductibles have been consistent  rate changes and changes in policy provisions have been measured accurately  reinsurance coverage has been consistent and reinsured losses are collectible 
to the extent any of the above factors have changed over time  attempts must be made to quantify and adjust for the changes 
supporting assumptions related to the external environment are as follows tort law and the legal environment have been consistent  coverage interpretation by the courts has been consistent  regulations regarding coverage provisions have been consistent  and loss inflation has been relatively steady 
to the extent any of the above factors have changed over time  attempts must be made to quantify and adjust for the changes 
the more the inconsistency  the greater the uncertainty of the loss reserve estimates 
the group has three categories of loss and lae reserves that it considers highly uncertain  and therefore  could have a material impact on future financial results and financial position asbestos and environmental liability exposures  construction defect exposures  and excess capacity liability exposures 
these categories are described below with relevant historical data 
in recent years  asbestos and environmental liability claims have expanded greatly in the insurance industry 
historically  the group has written small commercial accounts and has not sold policies with significant manufacturing liability coverages 
within the manufacturing category  the group has concentrated on the light manufacturers  which further limits exposure to environmental claims 
consequently  the group believes it does not have exposure to the primary defendants involved in major asbestos litigation 
the group s exposure to asbestos is related to installers and distributors as opposed to the large manufacturers 
in  the group increased asbestos reserves because of the expansion of litigation to these types of business 
the group s exposure to environmental liability is due to policies written prior to the introduction of the absolute pollution endorsement in the mid s  and to the underground storage tank leaks mostly from new jersey homeowners policies in recent item continued years 
the group has limited exposures to the national priority list  a list of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances  pollutants  or contaminants throughout the united states 
in  the group increased losses and lae by million for environmental claims from prior accident years 
in  the group re classified approximately million of homeowners reserves related to underground storage tanks as environmental reserves 
for  and  respectively  the asbestos and environmental reserves  excluding the impact of reinsurance  were million  million and million 
asbestos reserves were million  million and million and environmental reserves were million  million and million for those respective years 
the group defines construction defect exposure as liability for allegations of defective work and completed operations losses from general liability  commercial multiple peril liability and umbrella liability policies involving multiple units condos townhouses apartments tracts of single family homes  multiple defendants eg developers  sub contractors  usually with multiple defect issues  and often involving multiple insurance carriers 
the group excludes from the definition claims related to individual single family homes  apartments townhomes or other residential properties if the defect issues are limited in scope and volume 
the number of construction defect claims reported in  and  respectively  were  and the paid losses  net of reinsurance  in were million  compared to million in and million in the paid claims legal related lae  net of reinsurance  for construction defect claims were million in  compared with million in and million in these totals exclude construction defect losses from the state of california 
although the group has construction defect losses from california exposure  it excludes california from this data because the group stopped writing in the state in and the remaining claims are minimal and of a different nature than its exposure in the rest of the country 
this data also includes claims assumed from the gai acquisition beginning in november  slightly distorting the numbers 
the group writes excess capacity liability business with large policy limits that are heavily reinsured 
there have been very few losses to date on this business  but the large policy limits increase the uncertainty of future losses before the application of reinsurance 
there is a relatively small amount of loss data available for this business 
the group s coverage for approximately of this business written during begins when losses or lae on an individual claim reach million or more 
the group s limit of coverage on an individual claim for approximately two thirds of this business written during is million 
for losses occurring in  reinsurance purchased by the group limits its retention of losses to million and of million excess of million 
during  the group wrote approximately  of these excess capacity liability policies  representing an annual growth of approximately since results for the year were negatively impacted by losses and lae reserves for prior accident years totaling million before tax on an all lines basis 
losses and lae reserves for prior accident years were recognized during the year due to new information that caused a revision to prior estimates for loss and lae reserves as described above 
the following table provides the before tax expense of prior accident year loss and lae reserve development by reportable segment commercial lines specialty lines personal lines total accident year development item continued for the commercial lines operating segment  the losses and lae for prior accident years recorded during were concentrated in the commercial multi peril  workers compensation and general liability product lines 
in  the development was concentrated in the general liability  commercial automobile and worker s compensation product lines 
in  the development was concentrated in the workers compensation and general liability product lines 
for the specialty lines operating segment  the losses and lae for prior accident years recorded during was concentrated in the commercial umbrella product line 
roughly half of this amount  or million  was a reduction in estimated future costs for commercial umbrella claims adjuster related expenses 
in and  the development was concentrated in the commercial umbrella product line 
for the personal lines operating segment  the losses and lae for prior accident years recorded during and were concentrated in the personal automobile product line 
in  the development occurred in the homeowners product line 
the reserve study in third quarter revealed that average severity loss per claim and the amount of legal expense for certain types of construction defect claims were much greater than previously seen or anticipated 
the study also indicated that more of these severe claims had been reported and were expected to be reported in the future than previously anticipated  despite a decrease in frequency of other types of general liability claims 
it was concluded that these construction defect claims impacted the general liability  commercial multiple peril and commercial umbrella product lines 
as a result of this third quarter review  the estimate of ultimate loss and lae for this exposure was increased 
for these three product lines combined  the impact of construction defect in was million before tax 
the loss estimates for these claims are based on currently available information 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and legislatures  there is substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate liability 
in the group also experienced greater than expected loss activity from older accident years for the commercial automobile product line 
this was due to greater than expected severity on bodily injury claims 
as a result  the estimate of ultimate loss and lae was increased by million 
the following table provides prior year development for loss and lae by accident year accident year accident year accident year accident year accident year prior total accident year development the amount of loss and lae reserves by accident year at the beginning of was million for accident year  million for accident year and  million for accident year and prior 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating ultimate costs of claims  actual loss and lae may deviate substantially from the amounts recorded 
furthermore  the timing  frequency and extent of adjustments to the estimated liabilities cannot be predicted since conditions and events which established historical loss and lae reserve development and which serve as the basis for estimating ultimate claim cost may not occur in exactly the same manner  if at all 
item continued investment portfolio at year end  total consolidated investments had a carrying value of billion 
the excess of market value over cost was million  compared with million at year end and million at year end the increase in was attributable to the increase in the market value of certain equity securities 
the decrease in was largely due to the recognition of realized gains in connection with the sale of appreciated equity securities and declines in the market value of certain equity securities 
the reduction in unrealized gains related to equity securities in was somewhat offset by an increase in unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of million 
at december   the available for sale fixed maturity portfolio had a market value of billion  which consisted of investment grade securities 
the held to maturity fixed maturity portfolio is accounted for at amortized cost  which was million at december  and consists entirely of investment grade securities 
the consolidated fixed maturity portfolio has an intermediate duration and a laddered maturity structure 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is approximately years as of december  the corporation and the group remain fully invested and do not time markets 
the corporation and the group also have no off balance sheet investments or arrangements as defined by section a of the sarbanes oxley act of tax exempt fixed maturity securities increased  as a percentage of amortized cost  to of the fixed maturity portfolio at year end versus and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in and reflects a decision at the end of to add to municipal holdings in anticipation of improved underwriting results and to take advantage of unique municipal market opportunities 
in  as underwriting profitability improves the corporation and the group plan to invest more funds into tax exempt fixed maturity securities 
as of december   the corporation and the group held a total of  million in mortgage backed securities  compared with  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
as of december   million of these mortgage backed securities are held at amortized cost in the held to maturity portfolio 
in the first quarter of  management decided to transfer a portion of its fixed maturity securities from available for sale to held to maturity classification 
this transfer was made  as management believes the corporation and the group have both the ability to hold securities to maturity and the intent to do so 
the majority of mortgage backed security holdings are in sequential structures  planned amortization class and agency pass through securities 
of this portfolio  million  million and million were invested in more volatile bond classes eg interest only securities which do not return principal at maturity  super floater securities which pay interest at a formula rate that is a function of libor and inverse floater securities which pay interest per a formula that adjusts inversely to changes in libor rates at december   and  respectively 
securities are classified as investment grade or non investment grade based upon the higher of the ratings provided by s p and moody s 
when a security is not rated by either s p or moody s  the classification is based on other rating services  including the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners 
the market value of available for sale split rated fixed maturity securities ie  those having an investment grade rating from one rating agency and a below investment grade rating from another rating agency was million at december  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
item continued investments in below investment grade securities have greater risks than investments in investment grade securities 
the risk of default by borrowers that issue below investment grade securities is significantly greater because these borrowers are often highly leveraged and more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  including a recession or a sharp increase in interest rates 
additionally  investments in below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and subordinate to other debt 
investment grade securities are also subject to significant risks  including additional leveraging  changes in control of the issuer or worse than previously expected operating results 
in most instances  investors are unprotected with respect to these risks  the negative effects of which can be substantial 
at december   the fixed maturity portfolio included non investment grade securities and non rated securities that had a fair value of million and comprised of the available for sale fixed maturity investment portfolio and of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio 
this compares to a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these securities comprised and of the available for sale investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the held to maturity securities are all investment grade 
following is a table displaying available for sale non investment grade and non rated securities in an unrealized loss position at december amortized fair unrealized cost value loss the investment portfolio includes non publicly traded securities such as private placements  non exchange traded equities and limited partnerships which are carried at fair value 
fair values are based on valuations from pricing services  brokers and other methods as determined by management to provide the most accurate price 
the carrying value of this portfolio at december  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  at december   the group s equity portfolio was million  or of the total investment portfolio 
equity investments have decreased  as a percentage of market value of the consolidated portfolio  from at year end to at year end this decrease is primarily attributable to the corporation s and the group s and actions which reduced assets invested in equities 
equity securities are marked to fair value on the balance sheet 
as a result  shareholders equity and statutory surplus fluctuate with changes in the value of the equity portfolio 
as of december   the equity portfolio consisted of stocks in separate entities in different industries 
as of december   of the group s equity portfolio was invested in five companies and the largest single position was of the equity portfolio 
the corporation and the group use assumptions and estimates when valuing certain investments and related income 
these assumptions include estimations of cash flows and interest rates 
although the corporation and the group believe the values of its investments represent fair value  certain estimates could change and lead to changes in fair values due to the inherent uncertainties and judgements involved with accounting measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the corporation and the group are exposed to other risks such as equity price risk  credit  reinvestment and liquidity risk 
credit risk refers to the financial risk that an obligation will not be paid and a loss will result 
reinvestment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall causing the reinvestment of interim cash flows to earn less than the original investment 
liquidity risk describes the ease with which an investment can be sold without substantially affecting the asset s price 
the sensitivity analysis below summarizes only the exposure to market risk and equity price risk 
the corporation and the group strive to produce competitive returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of securities issued by high quality companies 
market risk the corporation and the group have exposure to losses resulting from potential volatility in interest rates 
the corporation and the group attempt to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management  periodic reviews of asset and liability positions and through maintaining a laddered maturity bond portfolio with an intermediate duration 
estimates of cash flows and the impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to the fixed maturity investment portfolio are modeled quarterly and reviewed regularly 
equity price risk equity price risk can be separated into two elements 
the first  systematic risk  is the portion of a portfolio or individual security s price movement attributed to stock market movement as a whole 
the second element  nonsystematic risk  is the portion of price movement unique to the individual portfolio or security 
this risk can be further divided between characteristics of the industry and of the individual issuer 
the corporation and the group attempt to manage nonsystematic risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diversified across industries 
the following tables illustrate the hypothetical effect of an increase in interest rates of basis points and a decrease in equity values at december   and  respectively 
the changes selected above reflect management s view of shifts in rates and values that are quite possible over a one year period 
these rates should not be considered a prediction of future events
