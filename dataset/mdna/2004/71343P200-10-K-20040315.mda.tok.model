overview we manufacture  distribute  and market a broad portfolio of beverage products in the us  central europe and the caribbean 
we sell a variety of brands that we bottle under franchise agreements with various brand owners  including pepsico or pepsico joint ventures 
in some territories  we manufacture  package  sell and distribute our own brands  such as toma brands in central europe 
our territories in the us include a significant portion of an state region  primarily in the midwest 
in central europe  we serve poland  hungary  the czech republic  and republic of slovakia 
in the caribbean  our territories include puerto rico  jamaica  barbados  the bahamas  and trinidad and tobago 
we measure our operating performance and manage our business to optimize shareholder value through five key drivers  including balance between volume and pricing  a controlled cost structure  strong execution in the marketplace  and improved utilization of our international infrastructure to achieve profitability in our combined international operations 
an overview of our operating performance and these factors in fiscal year  as well as the challenges and opportunities we face in achieving improved operating performance in  is summarized as follows volume 
worldwide volume declined percent in fiscal year  compared to the prior year 
excluding the benefit of the rd week see fiscal year in results of operations  worldwide volume would have declined percent  and us volume would have decreased percent 
the volume declines were primarily the result of continued declines in our single serve package and trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew volume  as well as the weak performance in the first quarter of trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew comprise approximately percent of our total volume 
in fiscal year  we have marketing and merchandising plans that will emphasize the single serve package and our core brands in an effort to stabilize volume and reverse the declining volume trends 
in addition  we continue to focus on package innovation as a driver of volume growth  with the introduction of the eight ounce can in the fourth quarter of  and the continued rollout of our fridge mate package in the us operations 
we anticipate that worldwide volume growth in  compared to excluding the rd week in the us  will be approximately percent as a result of these initiatives  as the declining trends continue to reverse  as begun in the fourth quarter of pricing 
the impact of the percent worldwide volume decline  on a comparable selling week basis  was offset by our disciplined pricing structure that we initiated in worldwide net selling price improved percent in fiscal year compared to the prior year  driven primarily by the pricing improvements in the us of percent 
maintaining our pricing discipline is a key factor in achieving operating income growth  and we anticipate maintaining worldwide net pricing growth in the range of to percent in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year excluding the rd week in the us controllable costs 
we continue to focus on our controllable costs 
on a comparable basis  adjusting for the impact of the rd week and assuming that eitf had been in effect  we reduced the rate of growth in our selling  delivery and administrative sd a expenses in fiscal year to percent  compared to percent growth in fiscal year from fiscal year in fiscal year  we will continue the focus on cost containment 

index execution in marketplace 
we continue to focus on execution in the marketplace  including our next generation selling system and call center investments in our next generation selling system improves the technology base supporting our selling process and improves the execution of the selling process in the marketplace 
as we convert to our next generation selling system  we are moving from a conventional route system to a pre sell system 
in the conventional route sales system  a route driver simultaneously takes the customer s order and delivers product to the customer 
in the pre sell environment  a dedicated sales person takes the customer s order and a delivery person subsequently delivers a pre determined order to the customer 
this new selling system is expected to increase distribution through the use of a dedicated sales team  decrease costs associated with handling products and allow us to optimize our delivery routing structure 
we will continue to have some rollout costs related to such investments in in addition  in we opened pepsi connect  our dedicated call center in fargo  north dakota 
this call center will take orders for the small format accounts whose volume does not justify a dedicated sales person 
this call center will allow us to provide the service these customers deserve at the appropriate cost 
profitability in our international operations 
the profitability in our international operations has been a challenge in the past due to macroeconomic and political conditions  as well as the competitive environments in which we operate  however  in fiscal year  we achieved profitability in our combined international operations for the first time 
operating income in our international operations was million in fiscal year  compared to a combined operating loss of million in the prior year 
profitability was achieved in our international operations due to several factors  including the successful rollout of the alternative sales and distribution strategy in central europe 
this strategy involves the use of third party distributors in the less densely populated rural areas 
poland is the last country to complete the migration to the alternative distribution strategy 
once completed  which is expected by the second quarter of  we anticipate annual savings of approximately million 
in addition  we have better leveraged the infrastructure in the caribbean in several ways  including the sourcing of production for barbados from an already existing manufacturing location and the utilization of a third party distributor  as well as expanding our portfolio of products for distribution in trinidad 
we will continue to experience the benefit from these initiatives in  however  in central europe  we will be faced with the challenges of entrance into the european union eu in may we anticipate higher costs in central europe in  including costs incurred for entry into the european union and higher sugar prices due to the elimination of price supports  which we plan to mitigate  in part  by our continued focus on achieving and maintaining higher net pricing 
our success in achieving operating income growth from the above factors  our efforts in driving lower borrowing costs and a lower effective tax rate  as well as our disciplined approach to capital spending and managing working capital effectively have driven significant increases in free cash flows 
our increase in free cash flow puts us in a very good financial position in  for which there are several options available to us 
we continue to examine the optimal uses of this cash and the options include increasing our dividends  repurchasing stock  investing in the business and pursuing acquisitions with a high economic return 
in january  we acquired the franchise rights to manufacture and distribute dr pepper in counties in arkansas for approximately million 
in addition  on february   we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on pepsiamericas common stock 
the dividend is payable april  to shareholders of record on march  in declaring the quarterly dividend  the board announced its decision to change its practice of reviewing dividend declarations on an annual basis 
instead  the board will institute a practice of reviewing dividend declarations on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly dividend marks the first declaration under this new quarterly approach 
the above overview should not be considered by itself in determining full disclosure  and should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis includes six major categories critical accounting policies  related party transactions  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  recently issued accounting pronouncements  and discussion of our market risks 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts or revisions become known 
presented in our notes to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of our most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of such statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include goodwill impairment  environmental liabilities  income taxes and casualty insurance costs which are described in further detail below 
index goodwill impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  using a two step approach at the reporting unit level us  central europe and the caribbean 
first  we estimate the fair value of the reporting units primarily using discounted estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the potential loss 
goodwill impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
the impairment evaluation requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine the fair value of the reporting units using discounted future cash flows  including estimates and assumptions regarding amount and timing of cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates 
environmental liabilities 
we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including potential environmental liabilities see environmental matters in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have recorded our best estimate of our probable liability under those indemnification obligations  with the assistance of outside consultants and other professionals 
such estimates and the recorded liabilities are subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries  the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible parties  the advancement of technology for means of remediation  possible changes in the scope of work at the contaminated sites  as well as possible changes in related laws  regulations  and agency requirements 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect management s best estimate of the outcome of future tax audits 
we have established valuation allowances against substantially all of the non us net operating losses to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to fully utilize these benefits given the limited carryforward periods permitted by the various jurisdictions 
the evaluation of the realizability of our net operating losses requires the use of considerable management judgment to estimate the future taxable income for the various jurisdictions  for which the ultimate amounts and timing of such estimates may differ 
the valuation allowance can also be impacted by changes in the tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in determining our contingent tax liabilities 
we have established contingent tax liabilities using management s best judgment and adjust these liabilities as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our tax liabilities in any given period could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows for that period 
casualty insurance costs 
due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
we are self insured for workers compensation  product and general liability up to million per occurrence and automobile liability up to million per occurrence 
the casualty insurance costs for our self insurance program represent the ultimate net cost of all reported and estimated unreported losses incurred during the fiscal year 
we do not discount casualty insurance liabilities 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are based on the best data available to us 
these estimates  however  are also subject to a significant degree of inherent variability  including the relatively recent increases in medical costs 
we evaluate these estimates with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate and within acceptable industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the estimates or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions transactions with pepsico pepsico is considered a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and pepsico s ownership interest in us 
as of fiscal year end  pepsico held  directly and indirectly  percent of pepsiamericas outstanding common stock 
approximately percent of our total volume is derived from the sale of pepsi cola products 
we have entered into transactions and agreements with pepsico from time to time  and we expect to enter into additional transactions and agreements with pepsico in the future 
material agreements and transactions between our company and pepsico are described below 

index bottling agreements and purchases of concentrate and finished products 
we purchase concentrates from pepsico and manufacture  package  distribute and sell carbonated and non carbonated beverages under various bottling agreements with pepsico

such purchases are reflected in cost of goods sold and totaled million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
a portion of our contractual cost of cans is subject to price fluctuations based on commodity price changes in aluminum 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge the price risk associated with anticipated purchases of cans see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pepsico acts as our agent for the execution of such derivative contracts 
bottler incentives and other support arrangements 
pepsico and pepsiamericas share a business objective of increasing availability and consumption of pepsi cola beverages 
accordingly  pepsico provides us with various forms of bottler incentives to promote their brands 
the level of this support is negotiated regularly and can be increased or decreased at the discretion of pepsico 
the bottler incentives cover a variety of initiatives  including direct marketplace  shared media and advertising support  to support volume and market share growth 
worldwide bottler incentives from pepsico totaled approximately million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended  and there are no conditions or requirements that could result in the repayment of any support payments received by us 
under the marketing support program  and in conjunction with the prospective adoption of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor in the first quarter of  bottler incentives that are directly attributable to incremental expenses incurred are reported as either an increase to net sales or a reduction to sd a expenses  commensurate with the recognition of the related expense

such bottler incentives primarily include base level funding amounts which are fixed in amount based on the previous year s volume and variable amounts that are reflective of the current year s volume performance 
prior to the adoption of eitf issue no 
and under previous marketing support programs  bottler incentives were primarily recognized as an increase to net sales or as a reduction in sd a expenses based on the objectives of the programs and initiatives 
based on information received from pepsico  pepsico provided indirect marketing support to our marketplace  which consisted primarily of media expenses 
this indirect support is not reflected or included in our consolidated financial statements  as these amounts were paid by pepsico on our behalf to a third party 
manufacturing and national account services 
we provide manufacturing services to pepsico in connection with the production of certain finished beverage products  and also provide certain manufacturing  delivery and equipment maintenance services to pepsico s national account customers

other transactions 
pepsico provides procurement services to us pursuant to a shared services agreement 
under such agreement  pepsico negotiates with various suppliers the cost of certain raw materials by entering into raw material contracts on our behalf 
in addition  pepsico collects and remits to us certain rebates from the various suppliers related to our procurement volume 
the raw material contracts obligate us to purchase certain minimum volumes 
in and  we paid million and million  respectively  to pepsico for such services

pohlad under the terms of the pepsiamericas merger agreement  dakota holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company whose members at the time of the pepsiamericas merger included pepsico and pohlad companies  was required to elect a contingent payment alternative in exchanging its shares of the former pepsiamericas 
mr 
pohlad is the president and the owner of one third of the capital stock of pohlad companies 
accordingly  in connection with the transaction  dakota holdings  llc acquired the right to receive up to  shares of our common stock if certain performance levels were met for the years through the affiliated transaction committee of the board  which oversaw the process of determining whether the contingent payments were earned under the pepsiamericas merger agreement  determined that no shares were issuable pursuant to this right

other transactions transactions with bottlers in which pepsico holds an equity interest 
we sell finished beverage products to other bottlers  including the pepsi bottling group  inc  a bottler in which pepsico owns an equity interest 
these sales occur in instances where the proximity of our production facilities to the other bottlers markets or lack of manufacturing capability  as well as other economic considerations  make it more efficient or desirable for the other bottlers to buy finished product from us 
our sales to other bottlers  including those in which pepsico owns an equity interest  were approximately million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended   and  respectively 
our purchases from such other bottlers for the fiscal years ended   and were not material 
results of operations in the discussions of our results of operations below  the number of cases sold is referred to as volume 
net pricing is net sales divided by number of cases and gallons sold for our core businesses  which include bottles and cans including bottle and can volume from vending equipment sales as well as food service 
changes in net pricing include the impact of sales price or rate changes  as well as the impact of brand  package and geographic mix 
net pricing and reported volume amounts exclude contract  commissary  private label  concentrate  and vending other than bottles and cans revenue and volume 
contract sales represent sales of manufactured product to other franchised bottlers and typically decline as excess manufacturing capacity is utilized 
cost of goods sold per unit is the cost of goods sold for our core businesses divided by related number of cases and gallons sold 
items impacting comparability fiscal year 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december and as a result  a rd week the rd week is added every five to six years 
fiscal year consisted of weeks ended on january  fiscal years and consisted of weeks ended on december  and december   respectively 
our fiscal year end policy only impacts our us operations 
our ceg and caribbean operations fiscal years end on december st and therefore are not impacted by the rd week 
the following table illustrates the approximate dollars in millions and percentage points of growth that the incremental week contributed to our operating results dollars percentage points net sales gross profit selling  delivery and administrative expenses operating income impact of emerging issues task force issue no 
in the first quarter of  we prospectively adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue no 
concludes that certain consideration received by a customer from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the price of the vendor s products  and therefore  should be recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold when recognized in the customer s income statement  unless certain criteria are met 
this presumption is overcome if the consideration paid to the customer is directly attributable offsetting to incremental and separately identifiable expenses incurred elsewhere in the income statement 
prior to the adoption of eitf issue no 
 bottler incentives marketing support programs from brand owners were recognized as an increase to net sales or as a reduction in sd a expenses based on the objectives of the programs and initiatives 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we recorded certain bottler incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold beginning in the first quarter of to properly account for new agreements 
bottler incentives that are directly attributable to incremental expenses incurred are reported as either an increase to net sales or a reduction to sd a expenses  commensurate with the recognition of the related expense 
all other bottler incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related products are sold based on the agreements with vendors 

index assuming that eitf issue no 
had been in place at the beginning of fiscal year and  the following adjustments would have been made to our fiscal year and reported results in millions net sales as reported   eitf issue no 
adjustment adjusted comparisons   cost of goods sold as reported   eitf issue no 
adjustment adjusted comparisons   sd a as reported eitf issue no 
adjustment adjusted comparisons  operating results compared with volume 
sales volume growth declines for and were as follows us central europe caribbean worldwide in  worldwide volume decreased percent compared to the prior year  mainly attributable to volume declines of percent in the us and percent in central europe offset by caribbean volume growth of percent 
excluding the benefit of the rd week  worldwide volume would have declined percent  and us volume would have decreased percent compared to the prior year 
the decline in worldwide volumes for the year was mainly due to the weak performance in the first quarter of in the us and central europe  the continued impact of lower single serve package volumes  and the impact of volume declines in trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew 
however  volume declines slowed throughout ending with the impact of a decrease in worldwide volume of percent in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in us volume of percent  excluding the benefit of the rd week  compared to the prior year 
the decline in us volume of percent in fiscal year  excluding the benefit of the rd week  reflected the weak performance in the first quarter of  as well as continued softness in single serve package volume and trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew  as consumer demands shifted and higher net selling prices were maintained 
we experienced softness across all channels  including continued volume declines in the small format channel 
from a brand perspective  the decline in us volume included mid single digit declines in trademark pepsi  driven mainly by lower volumes in brand pepsi  offset  in part  by the introduction of pepsi vanilla in the third quarter of the low single digit declines in trademark mountain dew reflected lower volumes in brand mountain dew  offset  in part  by the introduction of livewire in the second quarter of and volume increases in diet mountain dew 
trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew comprise almost percent of our total volume 
during  we continued to achieve growth in sierra mist and trademark lipton 
trademark aquafina volumes were relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior year 
in fiscal year  we have marketing and merchandising plans that will emphasize the single serve package and our core trademarks  pepsi and mountain dew  in an effort to stabilize volume 
in addition  we continue to focus on package innovation as a driver of volume growth  with the introduction of the eight ounce can in the fourth quarter of  and the continued rollout of fridge mate 
we anticipate to percent volume increases in the us in fiscal year compared to  excluding the rd week  as a result of these marketing and product innovation initiatives 

index total volume in central europe decreased percent during  and reflected volume declines in all four countries 
volume declined year over year in central europe due to several factors  including continued competitive pressures in the water and carbonated soft drink categories and poor weather conditions in the first quarter of in certain markets 
in central europe  carbonated soft drinks account for approximately percent of total volume  while the water category comprises approximately percent of our volume 
a new market entrant in the value priced water segment negatively impacted our volume trends as we maintained our pricing structure 
overall  we have maintained a similar disciplined pricing structure in central europe as we have in the us  despite the competitive pressures  which has negatively impacted our volume trends  but has positively contributed to our operating profit 
in  we will continue to re evaluate the balance between volume and pricing in the various markets to ensure maximization of our operating profits 
we expect central europe s volume to be flat in fiscal year  compared to  due to the impact of increased pricing which will be necessary to offset the effect of higher sugar costs expected to be incurred with the eu ascension in may total volume in the caribbean increased percent compared to the same period last year primarily reflecting volume improvements in puerto rico and trinidad 
puerto rico accounts for approximately percent of total volume in the caribbean 
overall  trademark pepsi volume grew in the mid single digits and accounts for approximately percent of the total caribbean volume 
aquafina  lipton and tropicana volume also improved over the prior year  while seven up volume declined from the prior year 
we anticipate continued volume growth in the caribbean in fiscal year of approximately to percent 
net sales 
net sales and net pricing statistics for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions net sales change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   net pricing growth decline us central europe caribbean worldwide net sales in decreased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million in on a comparable basis  assuming that eitf issue no 
had been in effect during and excluding the benefit from the rd week in in the us operations  net sales would have increased million  or percent  in  compared to the prior year 
the percent increase in worldwide net sales on a comparable basis primarily reflects an increase in worldwide net average selling prices of percent  driven by increased pricing in the us and central europe  favorable exchange rates in central europe  offset  in part  by the impact of volume declines in both the us and central europe 
in addition  our caribbean operations contributed positively to net sales growth in we anticipate worldwide net selling prices to increase to percent in fiscal year  compared to net sales in the us in decreased million to  million from  million in the prior year 
on a comparable basis  assuming that eitf issue no 
had been in effect during and excluding the benefit from the rd week in  net sales would have increased million  or approximately percent over the prior year 
the increase in us net sales was the result of improved net selling price per unit of percent  which offset the impact of the lower volumes in versus the improvement in net pricing was driven by price increases of approximately percent and package mix contribution of percent 
a favorable change in our can mix  including the eight ounce cans introduced in the fourth quarter of  as well as a reversal in declining trends in our ounce single serve business in the fourth quarter of  contributed to the positive mix impact 
net sales in central europe increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year 
the increase was attributed to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates of approximately million and an increase in net pricing  offset by the impact of the percent volume declines 
net sales in compared to the same period in the prior year were also negatively impacted by lower co packing revenue in the czech republic in of approximately million due to new packaging legislation in germany 
this new legislation negatively impacted the sales of products in returnable bottles due to deposit requirements 

index caribbean net sales increased percent to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales resulted mainly from volume growth of percent and increased net pricing in puerto rico and trinidad  offset  in part  by jamaica s decline in net pricing due  in part  to unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million last year

in the us  cost of goods sold decreased million  to  million from  million in on a comparable basis  assuming that eitf issue no 
had been in effect during and excluding the costs from the rd week  costs of goods sold would have increased million  or percent 
the increase in cost of goods sold on a comparable basis can be attributed to an increase in cost of goods sold per unit 
the increase in cost of goods sold per unit in the us reflected higher concentrate costs and increased costs related to product mix 
more of our products are being sold in non returnable pet packages versus can packages  which is a trend we expect to continue 
concentrate prices from pepsico beginning in february of were approximately percent higher than the prior year 
in  we anticipate that concentrate pricing will increase approximately percent compared to in central europe  cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  to million compared to million in the previous year 
assuming that eitf issue no 
had been in effect during  central europe cost of goods sold would have increased million in  compared to the prior year  due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately million 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and on a comparable basis  cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  which can be primarily attributed to the volume decline of percent for and the lower costs related to the decline in the german co packing business in the czech republic 
cost of goods sold per unit in central europe is expected to increase in due to higher sugar prices expected to be incurred with the eu ascension in may upon entry into the eu  price supports for sugar will be removed and our costs are expected to increase by approximately to million in for the period may through december  in the caribbean  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in  driven mainly by the increase in volume of percent and unfavorable foreign exchange rates in jamaica  offset  in part  by a lower cost of goods sold per unit

the decrease in sd a expense can be mainly attributed to the cost savings related to the migration to an alternative sales and distribution as d strategy in the rural areas in central europe 
our conversion to the as d model should be completed by the second quarter of  and upon completion  we expect cost savings of approximately million annually 
such future cost savings will be offset  in part  by the investment we will make in connection with the eu ascension in may sd a expenses in the caribbean decreased million to million in  and improved as a percentage of net sales to percent in  from percent in the prior year 
special charges 
during  we recorded special charges  net  of million  including the million charge  net  in the us related to the reduction in workforce  and net charges of million related to the changes in the production  marketing and distribution strategies in our international operations 
the us special charge  net  of million consisted mainly of severance related costs  including the acceleration of restricted stock awards  associated with the announced reduction in our us workforce in the first quarter of during  we recorded special charges of million in central europe related to the modification of the distribution method in poland  the czech republic  and republic of slovakia  offset by a million reversal of special charges recorded in the third quarter of related to the favorable outcomes associated with lease obligations and severance payments 
in the caribbean  we recorded special charges of million that consisted mainly of asset write downs related to the shutdown of the barbados manufacturing facility 
similar to the distribution changes we are making in central europe  we have rationalized our operation in barbados 
we are now outsourcing our distribution through a local partner and sourcing production from another manufacturing location we operate 
operating income 
operating income for and was as follows dollar amounts in millions change us central europe caribbean worldwide calculation of percentage change is not meaningful 
operating income increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in  driven mainly by an increase in operating income in our international operations of million 
the significant factors impacting us operating income in were the improvements in net pricing and the million contribution from the rd week  offset  in part  by a special charge  net  of million related to the reduction in the us workforce and the impact of volume declines and slightly higher sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
for the first time  we achieved operating profitability in our combined international operations 
operating income in our international operations was million in fiscal year  compared to a combined operating loss of million in the prior year 
operating income in central europe increased million to million in  compared to a loss of million in the prior year  while  in the caribbean  operating income increased million to million in  compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
approximately million of the caribbean improvement in operating income was related to a change in estimate regarding the lives of certain fixed assets 

index historically  the profitability of our international operations has been a challenge 
the infrastructure of our central europe and caribbean operations anticipated a certain growth in market share for pepsico branded products  however  the competitive environment  stronger than anticipated preferences to local branded products  as well as the overall macroeconomic and political conditions did not allow us to generate sufficient volume and revenue growth to cover the operating costs present in our current distribution infrastructures 
over the past several years  we have addressed the lack of profitability in our international operations in several ways 
in central europe  first  we have sought to expand the products we distribute beyond carbonated soft drink brands owned by pepsico and cadbury schweppes 
in  we acquired a local brand in central europe  toma  which allowed for the distribution of juices  still drinks and water under the toma brand to leverage our existing infrastructure 
secondly  we began modifying our distribution method in central europe in from a conventional direct store delivery model to an alternative model using distributors in rural areas 
poland is the last country to complete the migration to the alternative distribution strategy in the rural areas 
once completed  which is expected by the second quarter of  we anticipate annual savings of approximately million 
this change has both expanded our revenue by increasing our points of contact with the end customer and reduced costs 
as it relates to the caribbean markets  we have better leveraged our infrastructure in the caribbean in several ways  including the outsourcing of production for barbados from an already existing manufacturing location and the utilization of a third party distributor  as well as expanding our portfolio of products for distribution in trinidad 
we expect our international profitability to continue into as we benefit from these initiatives  however  we will be faced with challenges associated with the eu ascension in may we anticipate higher costs in central europe related to our implementation plans for entry into the eu as well as higher sugar prices  which we plan to mitigate  in part  by our continued focus on maintaining higher net pricing 
interest and other expenses 
net interest expense in was million  compared to million in the prior year 
included in net interest expense during was a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million  offset  in part  by a million increase in interest income due to the favorable resolution of a tax refund case related to our previous employee stock ownership plan esop  both recorded in the first quarter 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  our borrowing costs have benefited from overall lower interest rates  a slight shift in our fixed and floating rate debt mix with approximately percent of our total debt being fixed and the remaining floating  and the refinancing of a portion of our fixed rate debt in the first quarter of we recorded other expense  net  of million in compared to other expense  net  of million reported in included in other expense  net  in was a pre tax gain of million resulting from the sale of a parcel of land in downtown chicago 
in  we recorded an additional gain on the same land sale of million related to the reduction of certain accruals due to the favorable resolution of related contingencies 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate  which is income tax expense expressed as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes  was percent for excluding the additional tax accruals recorded of million in  million of tax benefit related to the favorable tax settlement associated with our previous esop in the first quarter  and the net reversal of tax accruals of million related primarily to the conclusion of various income tax audits through the tax year in the third quarter  the effective tax rate for was percent  compared to percent in the reduction was due primarily to a lower effective state income tax rate in the us an effective tax rate of percent is anticipated for see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the significant items recorded in income taxes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase can mainly be attributed to the increase in the operating profit performance of our international operations of million  the impact of the rd week in the us operations of million  lower borrowing costs resulting from lower interest rates  and the realization of certain tax benefits 
net income 
net income increased million to million in  compared to million in the factors affecting the improved performance were previously discussed 
in addition  net income in was reduced by a charge to discontinued operations of million after taxes 

index operating results compared with volume 
sales volume growth declines for and were as follows us central europe caribbean operations worldwide in  total volume increased percent  including us volume growth of percent and central europe volume growth of percent  while caribbean volume declined percent 
us volume growth of percent was driven by strong brand performance by mountain dew  sierra mist  aquafina and dr pepper 
mountain dew volume grew percent  driven mainly by continued growth in regular and diet mountain dew code red 
pepsi flavored soft drink volume grew almost percent  due mainly to the strong performance and expanded distribution of sierra mist  while aquafina continued to have strong volume growth of approximately percent 
the growth in pepsi branded products was partially offset by a percent volume decline in trademark pepsi  which accounts for approximately percent of the us volume mix 
dr pepper volume grew percent  led by diet dr pepper 
we experienced package volume growth for carbonated soft drinks in cans and take home pet packages or plastic bottle packages  led by the ounce non returnable pet package  which benefited from significant growth in the supermarkets and supercenters 
small format and on premise channel performance declined from the prior year  resulting primarily from continued softness in our single serve packages  primarily the ounce non returnable plastic bottles 
our central europe markets had volume growth of percent in  reflecting strong growth in all four countries 
new product innovation  including the introduction of pepsi twist  contributed to a percent growth in carbonated soft drinks  while water offerings experienced a strong percent growth 
both water and carbonated soft drinks experienced growth in the single serve and multi serve pet packages  primarily in the large format and wholesale channels  while on premise volume declined 
approximately percent of the total volume growth in central europe was achieved in still drinks  primarily due to the expanded distribution of the toma brand flavored still drinks in all our markets in central europe 
volume in the caribbean decreased percent in compared to  reflecting declines in puerto rico and jamaica 
overall  the pepsi trademark products declined  despite growth from new product introduction  while seven up  aquafina and other local flavored brands volume increased from the prior year 
net sales 
net sales and net pricing statistics for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions net sales change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   net pricing growth decline us central europe caribbean worldwide net sales in increased percent to  million compared to  million in excluding the million net sales of the beer business that was divested in the first quarter of  net sales increased million  or percent  primarily driven by the increase in net sales in the us and central europe 
us net sales increased percent to  million from  million 
excluding the net sales of the divested beer business in  us net sales increased percent  driven by volume growth of percent  as discussed above  and increased net pricing of percent from the prior year 
the increase in net pricing was driven by price increases of percent and package mix contribution of percent 
these factors were partially offset by a million  or percent  decrease in other revenue  including commissary and contract sales 

index the growth in central europe net sales of million  or percent  to million from million in the prior year resulted from strong volume growth of percent  as well as favorable foreign exchange rates offset  in part  by a percent decline in net pricing 
the favorable foreign exchange rates contributed approximately million to central europe s net sales improvement 
the volume growth impact on net sales was mitigated  in part  by the percent decline in net pricing in central europe  principally led by declines in poland offset  in part  by increases in hungary 
in addition  other revenues declined million from the prior year  including decreases in contract sales and private label sales  as was anticipated 
caribbean net sales increased percent in to million from million in the prior year 
volume in the caribbean decreased percent in compared to the prior year  offset by an increase in net pricing of percent in we achieved pricing improvements in all markets 
other revenue increases  including concentrate and export sales contributed percent of the net sales growth in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   cost of goods sold increased million in to  million from  million in the prior year 
excluding costs associated with the divested beer business totaling million in  cost of sales increased million  or percent  in in the us  excluding the impact of the divested beer business  us cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to  million  driven by the percent growth in volume  and an almost percent increase in cost of goods sold per unit 
the increase in cost of goods sold per unit reflected higher concentrate costs  as well as increases in other ingredient and packaging costs associated with changes in the mix of products sold 
this includes more of our products being sold in non returnable pet packages versus can packages 
the above factors were partially offset by a decrease in other cost of goods sold related to the decrease in contract and commissary sales 
in central europe  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year 
cost of goods sold increased due to volume growth of percent and due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations  which added approximately million to costs as measured in us dollars  offset  in part  by a lower cost per unit due mainly to lower concentrate costs 
in the caribbean  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year  driven mainly by unfavorable foreign currency translations and increased packaging and ingredient costs 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions change us central europe caribbean worldwide in  sd a expenses increased million  or percent  to million from million in the prior year 
sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in the prior year  which was primarily attributable to the us operations 
us sd a expenses increased million to percent as a percentage of us net sales  from percent 
this increase was primarily attributable to additional depreciation expense  as we continued to focus on capital projects to enhance our overall operating performance  including the substantial completion of our inventory system deployment in we also continued to invest in our next generation selling system  which will allow us to convert a significant portion of our us distribution system to a pre sell environment 
increased us sd a expenses were also attributable to higher wages and benefits  due  in part  to the aligning of the compensation and benefit programs of the former pepsiamericas and whitman corporation  as well as the compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock awards in conjunction with our long term incentive programs see note to the consolidated financial statements 

index sd a expenses in central europe increased million to million in the increase in sd a expenses was associated with the growth in volume  including new product introductions  offset  in part  by a decline in sd a expenses of approximately million related to foreign currency translation 
central europe s sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent  mainly due to improved sd a expense containment in poland 
sd a expenses in the caribbean increased million to million in sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat compared to the prior year for the caribbean 
amortization expense 
amortization expense declined million to million in  primarily due to the change in accounting for amortization expense for goodwill as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded special charges of million relating to the rollout of the changes in our marketing and distribution strategy in poland  the czech republic  and republic of slovakia 
the special charges included million related to severance and other benefits  million related to asset write downs and million related primarily to lease termination costs 
consistent with the changes in hungary in  we modified our distribution method from a conventional direct store delivery to an alternative model using third party distributors in certain areas 
in  we also recorded an additional million of severance costs related to the fiscal year charge in special charges  net 
in  we identified approximately million of excess severance and related exit costs  including million relating to the hungary special charge recorded in fiscal  and million relating to previous special charges 
upon execution of the distribution and marketing strategy change in hungary  there were instances where no viable third party distributors were found in certain areas of hungary  and thus  an alternative strategy was not available in those areas 
the reversals of million were credited to income and reflected in special charges  net 
in  we recorded special charges of million in the fourth quarter for severance costs and other costs related to changing our marketing and distribution strategy in hungary  as well as for the write down of obsolete marketing equipment in the us we established a new centralized facility to refurbish our marketing equipment  which changed our criteria for determination of refurbishment versus disposal of our marketing equipment 
this change in criteria resulted in an impairment of certain marketing equipment 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of related to further organizational changes resulting from the merger with the former pepsiamericas 
this charge was principally composed of severance and related benefits 
these changes in the marketing and distribution strategy in central europe  which resulted in special charges of and million in and  respectively  are expected to reduce costs  as well as to expand our market share by increasing our points of contact with the end customer 
we expect to realize approximately million in annual pretax savings across all of our markets in central europe  principally resulting from reductions in employee related and other distribution costs 
a portion of those savings were realized in hungary in during and  pepsiamericas paid employee benefits of and million  respectively  related to charges recorded in and  which included the elimination of approximately positions in total 
the payments made during and included deferred severance payments made to previously terminated employees 
at the end of fiscal year  million of employee related costs were accrued in current liabilities 
operating income

excluding the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill  us operating income declined million due mainly to higher sd a expenses 
the increase in sd a expenses related to higher depreciation expense associated with various information technology initiatives and to increased compensation and benefits expenses 
in  we had recorded special charges of million in the us  offset  in part  by an million pension curtailment gain 
central europe reduced its operating losses by million to an operating loss of million in the reduction in operating losses was mainly attributable to strong volume growth and the impact of foreign currency translation  as well as cost containment in cost of goods sold and sd a expenses 
lower special charges contributed million of the overall reduction in operating losses in central europe  as the hungary special charge was million in  compared to net special charges of million recorded in central europe in favorable foreign exchange rates contributed million of the reduction in operating losses in the operating losses in the caribbean increased by million to million in  due mainly to the percent decline in volume 
the markets in the caribbean were adversely impacted in the latter part of and in early by a decline in tourism 
the general decline in tourism resulted from the events occurring on september  we continue to consider various strategic alternatives in the caribbean markets in an effort to decrease our operating losses  as the macroeconomic and political conditions in the caribbean continue to pose operational challenges 
interest and other expenses 
net interest expense decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was principally due to lower interest rates on short term borrowings 
in addition  we adjusted the mix of our fixed rate versus floating rate debt using interest rate swap agreements  which favorably impacted interest expense in we reported other expense  net  of million in  compared to other expense  net  of million in the pre tax gain of million resulting from the sale of a parcel of land in downtown chicago was included in the results for in  the results included the benefit of certain real estate tax refunds associated with our non operating real estate entities 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate  which is income tax expense expressed as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes  was percent in  compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
 as a majority of the amortization expense was not deductible for tax purposes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the improvement in income from continuing operations reflected the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill  lower interest expense and a reduction in the effective income tax rate  as discussed previously 
discontinued operations

in  loss from discontinued operations after taxes of million represented a pretax charge of million to recognize additional liabilities associated with our indemnification obligations for environmental liabilities related to previously sold subsidiaries 
this additional charge resulted from conducting a comprehensive review of all former facilities operated by these previously sold subsidiaries  which was initiated in connection with the insurance policies purchased in net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in the improvement in net income resulted from higher income from continuing operations  up million  and the lower losses from discontinued operations  lower by million 
the factors that impacted both continuing and discontinued operations were discussed previously 

index liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in  compared to million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in can be mainly attributed to the pay down of our accounts receivable securitization program of million in the fourth quarter of  as our primary working capital improved by million due mainly to the improvement in our days sales outstanding 
significant cash outlays for operating activities included our contribution of million to our pension plan in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we are million underfunded in our pension plans as of the end of fiscal year  and we expect to fund approximately million to our pension plan in fiscal year we do not believe that any known trends or uncertainties related to our pension plan will result in a material change in our results of operations  financial condition  or our liquidity 
investing activities 
investing activities during included capital investments of million  down million from capital investments of million in capital spending in included the initial rollout of the fridge mate  as well as other package introductions  and decreased in compared to the prior year primarily due to planned lower spending on machinery and equipment 
fridge mate is a pack ounce can package using a two by six can configuration 
fridge mate is replacing our previous pack ounce package with a three by four can configuration 
we believe the fridge mate package is preferred by consumers 
capital spending in  excluding potential acquisitions  is expected to be in the range of million to million

financing activities 
our total debt decreased million to  million as of the end of fiscal year  from  million as of the end of fiscal year in the first quarter of  we issued million of notes due in march with a coupon rate of percent 
net proceeds from these notes were million  which reflected the reduction for discount and issuance costs totaling million  as well as a treasury rate lock settlement payment of million 
the proceeds were used to redeem million of notes that were issued in march in february  the investors of the million of notes issued in march notified us that they wanted to exercise their option to purchase and remarket the notes pursuant to the remarketing agreement  unless we elected to redeem the notes 
in march  we redeemed the notes pursuant to the agreement 
we paid approximately million for the fair value of the debt to be extinguished  net of the reverse treasury rate lock settlement of million 
in addition  we repaid the million percent notes that came due during the first quarter of during september  we issued million of notes due  with a coupon rate of percent 
we have revolving credit agreements with maximum borrowings of million  which act as back up for our commercial paper program  accordingly  we have a total of million available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility combined 
we had million of commercial paper borrowings as of the end of fiscal year in the third quarter of  we effected a new shelf registration under which up to billion of debt securities can be offered 
the debt securities will be unsecured  senior debt obligations and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
no debt securities have been issued from this shelf registration 
in august  we announced that we would resume purchasing our common stock under a previously authorized repurchase program 
in december  the board authorized an additional million shares for our repurchase program 
as of fiscal year end  million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in and million shares in for million and million  respectively 
in addition  during we paid million relating to treasury stock purchases that were unsettled and included in other accrued expenses at the end of in the consolidated balance sheet 
we paid cash dividends of million in based on an annual cash dividend of per share  compared with million paid in  based on the same dividend rate 
the issuance of common stock  including treasury shares  for the exercise of stock options resulted in cash inflows of million in  compared with million in 
index we believe that our operating cash flows are sufficient to fund our existing operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe that our operating cash flows  available lines of credit  and the potential for additional debt and equity offerings will provide sufficient resources to fund our future growth and expansion 
there are a number of options available to us and we continue to examine the optimal uses of our cash  including increasing dividends  repurchasing stock and investing in the business or acquisitions  assuming a high economic return 
in january  we acquired the franchise rights to manufacture and distribute dr pepper in counties in arkansas for approximately million 
in addition  on february   we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on pepsiamericas common stock 
the dividend is payable april  to shareholders of record on march  in declaring the quarterly dividend  the board announced its decision to change its practice of reviewing dividend declarations on an annual basis 
instead  the board will institute a practice of reviewing dividend declarations on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly dividend marks the first declaration under this new quarterly approach 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of the end of fiscal year  by due date 
long term debt obligations do not include amounts related to the fair value adjustment from interest rate swaps and unamortized discount premium 
our short term and long term debt  lease commitments  purchase obligations and advertising and exclusivity rights are more fully described in notes  and  respectively  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations  net of insurance  under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including indemnification expenses for potential environmental and tort liabilities of these prior subsidiaries 
there is significant uncertainty in assessing our potential expenses for complying with our indemnification obligations  as the determination of such amounts is subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries and the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible and financially viable parties 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement and timing of cash requirements related to such indemnification obligations may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
at the end of fiscal year  we had recorded million in liabilities for future remediation and other costs arising out of our indemnification obligations 
this amount excludes possible insurance recoveries and is determined on an undiscounted cash flow basis 
in addition  we have funded coverage pursuant to an insurance policy purchased in fiscal year see finite funding discussion in environmental matters in item  which reduces the cash required to be paid by us for certain environmental sites pursuant to our indemnification obligations 
the finite funding amount recorded was million at the end of fiscal year  of which million is expected to be recovered in based on our expenditures  and is thus  included as a current asset 
during fiscal years and  we paid approximately million and million  respectively  related to such indemnification obligations  net of insurance settlements of million and million  respectively  as well as the benefit of taxes

eitf addresses the classification on the income statement of certain consideration paid to a reseller or another party that purchases our products 
as a result  net sales were reduced by million in and million in  with sd a expenses reduced by the same amounts 
prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the presentation  including prior quarters in see note to the consolidated financial statements

 all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
this statement eliminates sfas no 
and thus  the criteria in apb opinion no 
should be applied to determine the classification of gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt 
the statement was effective beginning in fiscal year as a result  the loss on the early extinguishment of debt recorded in fiscal year was recognized in interest expense  net in the consolidated statements of income  as the criteria in apb opinion no

the special charges recorded during fiscal year are in compliance with sfas no 
see note 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are subject to various market risks  including risks from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
commodity prices 
the risk from commodity price changes correlates to our ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of our aluminum and fuel requirements 
each instrument hedges price fluctuations on a portion of our aluminum can and fuel requirements over a specified period of time 
because of the high correlation between aluminum and fuel commodity prices and our contractual cost of these products  we consider these hedges to be highly effective 
as of fiscal year end  we have hedged a portion of our future us aluminum requirements into fiscal year and we had no outstanding fuel hedge contracts 
interest rates 
our floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month london interbank offered rate libor and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of fiscal year end  a basis point change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense 
in the third quarter of and the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate 
in  we had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to the overnight federal funds rate 
the amount of these investments was not significant throughout the year 
assuming a basis point change in the rate of interest associated with our short term investments  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
currency exchange rates 
because we operate in non us franchise territories  we are subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
we currently do not hedge the translation risks of investments in our non us operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
based on net sales  non us operations represented approximately percent of our total operations in changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the non us operations results from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by five percent in  we estimate the impact on reported operating income would have been approximately million 
our estimate reflects the fact that a portion of the non us operations costs are denominated in non us dollars  including concentrate purchases 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category
