item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
portions of this document that are not statements of historical or current fact are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements in this document involve risk and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this document should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following risks related to the growth of our fast contract  including strains on resources and decreases in operating margins  federal government audits and cost adjustments  differences between authorized amounts and amounts received by us under government contracts  government customers failure to exercise options under contracts  changes in federal government or other applicable procurement laws  regulations  policies and budgets  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to retain contracts during re bidding processes  pricing pressures  undertaking acquisitions that might increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive  integration of acquisitions  and changes in general economic and business conditions 
overview we provide sophisticated systems engineering  information technology  intelligence and program management services  primarily to us defense  intelligence and civilian federal government agencies 
our services encompass the full system life cycle from requirements definition  design  development and integration to upgrade  sustainment and support for mission critical information and weapons systems 
for the years ended december  and  about and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from our customers

and subsidiaries in the department of defense and the intelligence community  including the us air force  us army and joint military commands 
having served the department of defense since our founding in  we believe we are well positioned to assist the federal government as it increases its focus on modernizing defense capabilities and maintaining national security 
we report operating results and financial data as a single segment and believe our contract base is well diversified 
however  a significant amount of our revenue has in recent years been earned under two contracts  the asc bpa and the fast contract 
revenue under the asc bpa was approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the largest task order under the asc bpa amounted to approximately of total revenue for the years ended december  and the asc bpa  which was originally awarded as a small business set aside contract  expires on september  and our ability to retain this contract is uncertain 
it is possible that some of our current work under the asc bpa could be converted to gsa schedules or other contract vehicles 
in july  we were one of six awardees of the fast contract with a ceiling of billion and with a period of performance  including option years  which extends to revenue under the fast contract was approximately and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fast revenue for the year ended december  was comprised of separate task orders  the largest of which amounted to approximately of total revenue for that period 
in prior years  we performed some of the work we are now performing on the fast contract on other contract vehicles 
while the fast contract represents a significant percentage of our total revenue  we believe that the broad array of engineering  technical and management services we provide to the federal government through various contract vehicles allows for diversified business growth 
no other task order  including individual contracts under our gsa vehicles  accounted for more than of revenue for the year ended december under the fast contract  we have the potential to compete for hundreds of millions of dollars in task orders each year over its approximately four and a half year remaining life as the us air force maintains and modernizes aircraft and defense systems 
as of december   we have been awarded task orders under the fast contract with a remaining potential award value of approximately million if all options are exercised 
although we believe the fast contract presents an opportunity for significant additional growth and expansion of our services  we expect that many of the task orders we may be awarded under the fast contract will be for program management services  which historically have been less profitable than our other activities 
in addition  the fast contract involves a significantly greater use of subcontractors than we have used historically 
margins on subcontractor based revenue are typically lower than the margins on our direct work 
since the fast contract is expected to be a significant part of our business for the next several years  we anticipate our operating income  as a percentage of total revenue  will diminish  although it will grow in absolute dollars 
our federal government contracts  which comprised over of our revenue in  are subject to government audits of our direct and indirect costs 
the incurred cost audits have been completed through december  and the rates have been agreed to 
we do not anticipate any material adjustment to our financial statements in subsequent periods for audits not yet completed 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue came from work provided to our customers as a prime contractor and the balance came from work provided as a subcontractor 
approximately and  respectively  of our revenue for the years ended december  and consisted of the work of our employees  and the balance was provided by the work of subcontractors 
our work as a prime contractor on the fast contract has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant use of subcontractors

and subsidiaries we typically provide our services under contracts with a base term  often of three years  and option terms  typically two to four additional terms of one year or more  which the customer can exercise on an annual basis 
we also have contracts with fixed terms  some extending as long as five or six years 
although we occasionally obtain government contracts for which the contracting agency obligates funding for the full term of the contract  most of our government contracts receive incremental funding  which subjects us to the risks associated with the government s annual appropriations process 
contract types 
when contracting with our government customers  we enter into one of three basic types of contracts time and materials  fixed price and cost plus 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we receive a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour worked  plus reimbursement for our allowable direct costs 
to the extent that our actual labor costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates under a time and materials contract  we can either make more money than we originally anticipated or lose money on the contract 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform specified work for a firm  fixed price 
if our actual costs exceed our estimate of the costs to perform the contract  we may generate less profit or incur a loss 
a significant portion of our fixed price contract work is under a fixed price level of effort contract  which represents a similar level of risk to our time and materials contracts  under which we agree to perform certain units of work for a fixed price per unit 
we generally do not undertake high risk work  such as software development  under fixed price contracts 
cost plus contracts 
under cost plus contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and receive a supplemental fee  which represents our profit 
cost plus fixed fee contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of anticipated costs 
cost plus incentive fee and cost plus award fee contracts provide for increases or decreases in the contract fee  within specified limits  based upon actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost  quality  schedule and performance 
the following table provides information about the percentage of revenue attributable to each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated years ended december  time and materials fixed price cost plus total critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
our critical accounting policies primarily concern revenue recognition and related cost estimation 
we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus the costs of any allowable expenses incurred 
we recognize revenue on fixed price contracts under the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs  or upon delivery of specific products or services  as appropriate 
we recognize revenue on cost plus contracts to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
we consider performance based fees  including award fees  under any contract type to be earned only when we can demonstrate satisfaction of a specific performance goal or we receive contractual notification from a customer that the fee has been earned 
in all cases  we recognize revenue only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists including when waiting for formal funding authorization under federal government contracts  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries we began recording work in process inventory during the second quarter of because some of our task orders under the fast contract have reached the production delivery stage 
on these task orders  we are now required to meet customer delivery schedules as part of our program management services 
the inventory relates to costs accumulated under fixed price type contracts accounted for under the completed contract method and certain output measures  such as units delivered  of the percentage of completion method 
the work in process inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is computed on an average cost basis 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
from time to time  circumstances develop that require us to revise our total estimated costs or revenue expectations 
in most cases  these changes relate to changes in the contractual scope of our work  and do not significantly impact the expected profit rate on a contract 
we record the cumulative effects of any revisions to our estimated total costs and revenue in the period in which circumstances requiring revision become known 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of the costs for providing our services to customers  which primarily include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees directly serving customers  and the occupancy and other infrastructure costs necessary to support those employees 
cost of revenue also includes the cost of subcontractors and outside consultants  third party materials  such as hardware and software  that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of the contract  depreciation  and any other costs  such as travel expenses  incurred to support contract efforts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees not performing work directly for customers 
among the functions included in these expenses are contracts  administration  business development  accounting  human resources  information systems support  and executive and senior management 
general and administrative expenses also include related depreciation  all amortization  and occupancy and travel expenses for employees performing general and administrative functions 
for the year ended december   it also includes million in non cash stock compensation expense 
included in general and administrative expenses prior to march  were management fees paid to a related party 
the management fees were paid to a wholly owned affiliate of our then sole stockholder 
the nature of services received from the affiliate included our then sole stockholder s services as our chief executive officer  assistance with negotiating financing arrangements  assistance with evaluating acquisition candidates and legal services 
these fees ceased on march  we continue to utilize aircraft that we jointly own with and rent certain facilities from entities related to our chairman of the board 
although the management fees have been eliminated  most of these costs have been replaced on a recurring basis and  by virtue of being a public company  we now incur certain general and administrative costs not previously incurred 
goodwill and intangible assets 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  on january   we amortized goodwill over fifteen years 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued amortization of goodwill 
purchase price allocated to intangible assets is amortized using the straight line method over the estimated terms of the contracts 
we have elected to conduct our annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year 
we base our assessment of possible impairment on the discounted present value of the operating cash flows of our consolidated operating unit 
income taxes 
on june   we changed our s corporation status to c corporation status under internal revenue service regulations 
as a result of this change  we were required under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to establish deferred tax balances 
as a result  a non cash deferred tax benefit of million  and current and non current deferred tax assets were recorded in june  primarily for timing differences between book and tax reporting associated with accrued compensation items 
during the third quarter of  we began recording a provision for federal and state income taxes 
accordingly  an income tax provision is included in the income statements for all periods after june  
table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries prior to june   under our s corporation election  all items of income and expense were passed through and taxed at the stockholder level 
therefore  we were not required to record a provision for federal and state income taxes 
accordingly  the income statements do not reflect an income tax provision

million of our organic growth was delivered through the use of subcontractors  primarily in connection with several task orders under the fast contract 
the balance of our organic growth was the result of a million increase in work by our own people on new or increased contracts and task orders  primarily from growth in fast  asc bpa and gsa task orders 
the increase in direct revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from our two largest non defense customer groups and decreased revenue on task orders that ended after december  gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million as compared to million in the same period in this increase primarily reflects the significant increase in revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for this decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the previously forecasted increase in the use of subcontractors 
margins on subcontractor based revenue are typically lower than the margins on our direct work 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased  or approximately million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is solely attributable to the million non cash stock compensation expense that was recorded in march  as discussed below 
without this charge  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  would have increased  or million as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of increased salary and benefit expenses resulting from the addition of personnel to support our growth as well as increased insurance and bid and proposal costs 
however  the percentage of general and administrative expenses before stock compensation declined as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for non cash stock compensation expense of million was recorded in march in connection with the issuance to three senior executives of non qualified options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the charge represents the difference between the option price of and the estimated fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant of per share 
all other options issued since march have an option price equal to the estimated fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant and as such require no charge against earnings

and subsidiaries intangible asset amortization intangible asset amortization for the year ended december  increased approximately million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of a full year of amortization of the purchase price allocated to the contracts of amcomp of million as well as the million of intangible asset amortization recorded in the fourth quarter of for the acquisition of ici and vitronics 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  a major cause of this increase in operating income was primarily the result of the million non cash stock compensation expense that was recorded in march  as discussed above 
without this charge  operating income for the year ended december  would have increased  or million as compared to  primarily resulting from the increased gross profit  partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses excluding the non cash stock compensation expense and intangible asset amortization 
excluding the stock compensation expense  operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased from of revenue for the year ended december  to for net interest income expense net interest income for the year ended december   increased by million  to million as compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december  we repaid all outstanding debt in july with proceeds from our initial public offering and invested the balance of the proceeds  which has resulted in net interest income 
income tax expense we did not record a provision for income taxes for the periods prior to june  because we were an s corporation for income tax purposes and  as a result  were not subject to federal or certain state income taxes 
on june   we changed from an s corporation to a c corporation under internal revenue service regulations 
as a result of this change  we were required under sfas no 
to establish deferred tax balances 
as a result  a non cash deferred tax benefit of million  and current and non current deferred tax assets were recorded in june  primarily for timing differences between book and tax reporting associated with accrued compensation items 
during the third quarter of  we began recording a provision for federal and state income taxes 
accordingly  an income tax provision is included in the income statements for all periods after june  since we have started paying income taxes  our effective rate has remained relatively unchanged at approximately 
net income net income increased  or approximately million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in net income was primarily the result of increased operating income 
excluding the million non cash stock compensation expense and the million non cash deferred tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  and assuming that a income tax rate had been effective for the entire twelve months ended december   net income for the year ended december  would have increased  or million  as compared to comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased  or approximately million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from the following approximately million increase in subcontract revenue recognized under the fast contract  approximately million of net additional revenue resulting from new contracts and task orders  including us marine corps infrastructure  us army technical  engineering  fabrication  and operations support service  fast  asc bpa and cruise missile product group advisory and analysis support projects  partially offset by other programs which ended in  and approximately million of revenue growth resulting from the acquisition of amcomp in october

intangible asset amortization intangible asset amortization for the year ended december  decreased  or million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was a result of achieving full amortization of the purchase price allocated to the contracts of rjo enterprises  inc in september  and the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of rjo enterprises  inc on january   when we adopted sfas no 
 which terminated the policy of goodwill amortization 
in october  after acquiring amcomp  we began amortizing the million of purchase price allocated to the contracts of amcomp over their estimated useful life of years  as determined by an independent appraiser  resulting in a charge to earnings of million 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  decreased  or million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was caused by the accrual of the non cash stock compensation expense of million

income tax expense on june   we changed our s corporation status to c corporation status under internal revenue service regulations 
this change required us to establish deferred tax balances  in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  a deferred tax benefit of approximately million  and current and non current deferred tax assets were recognized in june  primarily for timing differences between book and tax reporting associated with accrued compensation items 
the income tax expense of million for the year ended december   includes a net deferred tax benefit of million and current income tax expense of million recognized on net income generated since we changed to a c corporation on june  excluding the million deferred tax benefit recognized in june  our effective tax rate for the period we were a c corporation was approximately 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations decreased  or approximately million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from the million non cash stock compensation expense  partially offset by the million income tax benefit recognized during the second quarter of without these two items  income from continuing operations would have been approximately million for an increase of over however  income from continuing operations for does not reflect any income tax expense  due to our s corporation status  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our positive cash flow from operations and our available credit facility have provided us adequate liquidity and working capital to fund our operational needs and support our acquisition activities 
our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million on december  and  respectively 
our working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
our working capital decreased million in primarily as a result of the following fluctuations a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflecting the million in payments for businesses acquired in  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities  a million increase in other current liabilities primarily resulting from a million increase in accounts payable reflecting increased non labor costs  such as subcontract costs and direct materials  that resulted from the increased revenue volume in  and from million in additional amounts due under earn out agreements  and a million increase in accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed resulting from the significant increase in revenue in as well as the acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of our operating activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  the cash provided by operating activities was primarily composed of net income adjusted for a the approximately million in deferred income tax expense  b million of depreciation and amortization expense  and c the million of cash used for working capital purposes 
our operating activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of a net increase in working capital requirements 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   as a result of million in payments made in connection with acquisitions 
the million includes the additional consideration of million which was paid to the former shareholders of amcomp in april as well as the purchase price and acquisition related payments totaling million which were paid in the fourth quarter of for the acquisition of ici and vitronics 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million and will be for general corporate purposes 
our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  compared with million in the same period of the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the cash paid for the acquisition of amcomp of million  including acquisition expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in advances to affiliates 
no further advances to affiliates have been or will be made subsequent to march   and all balances at that date have been paid in full 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily through common stock issuances and surrenders related to stock option transactions 
during the year ended december   cash provided from financing activities was million 
the cash was primarily provided by the net proceeds of our initial public offering of million 
we used a portion of these proceeds to repay our total bank debt outstanding on july   reducing the amount outstanding under those instruments from million as of december  to zero 
prior to our initial public offering  we also made million of distributions to our then sole stockholder  offset by a million capital contribution from our then sole stockholder 
during the year ended december   we used million in cash for financing activities which included repayment million of debt and a million distribution to our then sole stockholder 
during the year ended december   we used million in cash and shares of our common stock with a value of million to finance the initial purchase price for ici and vitronics  including acquisition costs 
contingent payment obligations related to those acquisitions  as well as contingent payment obligations related to the amcomp acquisition made during the year ended december   could require us to make additional cash payments and issue additional shares of our common stock 
see business acquisitions above 
in january  we replaced our million revolving line of credit with a million revolving line of credit 
in january  we amended the agreement governing our revolving line of credit  increasing the line of credit to million 
we can increase this line to million subject to meeting certain requirements and obtaining our lenders approval 
the agreement expires in december  and can be extended for additional one year terms by mutual agreement with our lenders 
the interest rate we will pay if we have any borrowings will range from the prime rate less basis points to prime rate plus basis points  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus to basis points  depending on the ratio of our funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
borrowings under our line of credit are secured by a general lien on our consolidated assets 
in addition  we are subject to certain restrictions  and are required to meet certain financial covenants 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
the company s net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after the underwriting discount and other expenses  was million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering together with cash on hand and additional borrowings for working capital and general corporate purposes  including all or a portion of the costs of any complementary businesses we selectively decide to acquire in the future 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries part of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses 
we have made acquisitions in the past  and intend to make acquisitions in the future 
historically  we have financed our acquisitions with the proceeds of our initial public offering  cash on hand and shares of our common stock 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions with proceeds from our recent common stock offering  cash generated by operations  additional sales or issuances of shares of our common stock  borrowings under our credit facility or a combination of the foregoing 
management believes that the proceeds from the recent sale of shares by us and our cash and cash equivalents balance  together with cash generated by operations and amounts available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  debt service obligations  purchase price commitments for completed acquisitions and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate cash from operations depends to a significant extent on winning new and re competed contracts and or task orders from our customers in competitive bidding processes 
if a significant portion of our government contracts were terminated or if our win rate on new or re competed contracts and task orders were to decline significantly  our operating cash flow would decrease  which would adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities spes or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes

quarterly results of operations our results of operations  particularly our revenue  gross profit and cash flow  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contract performance  revenue earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of customer orders or deliveries  changes in the scope of contracts and billing of other direct and subcontract costs  timing of funding of task orders  the commencement and completion of contracts we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity  as well as in the number of contracts or task orders commenced or completed during any quarter  may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a federal budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year  our customers may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
any suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenue in the fourth quarter of the year  and possibly ensuing quarters of the following year 
on november   president bush signed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year in addition  a change in presidential administrations  congressional majorities or in other senior federal government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases technology and engineering services 
the federal government s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials 
any increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the federal government s fiscal year end would serve to increase our fourth quarter revenues  but will generally decrease profit margins for that quarter  as these activities typically are not as profitable as our normal service offerings 
further  some of our subcontractors have calendar year ends and sometimes submit large billings at the end of the calendar year that can cause a spike in our revenue and expenses related to subcontracts 
this will also generally decrease our profit margins as revenues generated by billings from subcontractors generally have much lower margins than our revenues generated by direct work 
as a result of the above factors  period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful 
potential investors should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance as no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition
