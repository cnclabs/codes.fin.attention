the company sold all of its operating units in and began evaluating new internet related business opportunities 
the company perceived a need for products and services to bring privacy  security and convenience to internet communications and since january  the company has been developing and marketing products and services that bring privacy  security and convenience to internet users 
in the first quarter of  the company began charging for the use of zixmail  its initial product in the secure e messaging space  and began focusing its sales and marketing efforts toward the business market 
in and  the company significantly expanded its portfolio of commercial products and services  as detailed in item business products and services above  and rebuilt its sales and marketing work force under new executive leadership 
the company has targeted the healthcare sector  where the legislated mandates of the health insurance portability and accountability act  a law that requires protected health information to be safeguarded over open networks  are driving demand 
the privacy regulations for this law took effect in april in july  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of ohio based pocketscript  llc pocketscript  a privately held development stage enterprise which provides electronic prescription solutions for the healthcare industry 
this acquisition enables the company to expand its services into the e prescription marketplace  which is expected to grow significantly as more physicians are leveraging technology in delivering care  coupled with the fact that the number of prescriptions written annually in the united states continues to increase 
in september  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of elron software  inc elron software or elron  a majority owned subsidiary of elron electronic industries ltd 
and a provider of anti spam  email content filtering and web filtering solutions 
this acquisition enables the company to add a robust feature set to its anti spam  anti virus  and content filtering services while expanding its offerings to include web filtering 
both pocketscript and elron software have incurred operating losses in recent years 

table of contents the foundation of the company s business model is centered around the financial leverage expected to be generated by its various subscription and transaction based revenues that are believed to be predominantly recurring in nature and an efficient cost structure for its secure data center operations  the core of which is expected to remain relatively stable 
subscription fees are generally expected to be collected annually at the beginning of the subscription period and are recognized as revenue on a prorated basis over the length of the subscription period 
anacom communications  inc anacom  a privately held provider of real time transaction processing services to internet merchants purchased by the company in october  ceased operations in june anacom was purchased in conjunction with the company s development of a potential product  zixcharge tm  which was never commercially released 
operating losses and liquidity have been favorably impacted by anacom s shut down  as anacom recorded operating losses  excluding non cash charges  of  for operating in emerging markets involves risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts 
successful growth of an early stage enterprise  particularly internet related businesses  is costly and highly competitive 
the company s growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of its products and services 
in and  the company and its recent acquisitions have incurred significant operating losses during their development stage activities and the utilization of cash resources has continued at a substantial level 
the company anticipates further operating losses in results of operations continuing operations revenues the company was in the development stage and had no significant revenues in and substantially all of the company s revenues in were generated by anacom  which ceased operations in june the company first began charging for its secure e messaging products and services in the first quarter of revenues from subscription services are recognized as the services are rendered 
subscription fees received from customers in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenues ratably over the subscription period 
revenues for of  were primarily comprised of the amortization of subscription fees generated from us businesses and  or of annual revenues  resulting from the pro rata recognition of the future minimum payments associated with the company s marketing and distribution agreement the marketing agreement with entrust  inc entrust 
additionally  in march  the company cancelled its agreement with computer co  ltd 
 its exclusive distributor in south korea  for failure to pay scheduled installment payments when due 
as a result  the  minimum payment previously received from was included in revenues 
revenues increased from  in to  in due primarily to an increase of approximately  in amortization of secure e messaging subscription fees generated from new us corporate customers primarily in the healthcare sector   associated with the cancellation of the company s japanese distributor agreement  and  in email content and web filtering software sales as well as  in related maintenance following the acquisition of elron software on september  deferred maintenance revenue acquired in connection with the acquisition of elron software was recorded at  its fair value on the acquisition date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  resulting in a reduction in the pre acquisition balance 
therefore  assuming the affected product maintenance contracts are renewed  reported maintenance revenue should begin to increase quarter over quarter in the near term as the full contract values of such renewal contracts are amortized ratably to revenue 
elron software products are offered to customers under perpetual license agreements 
the company recognizes revenue on these arrangements after all of the following occur persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the software is delivered  collection is probable  fees are fixed and determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists to allocate the total fees to the elements of the arrangement 
these software licenses are sold as part of a multiple element arrangement that includes 
table of contents annual maintenance  and often times implementation or training services 
where vsoe has not been established for certain elements  revenue for all elements is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their fair values have been determined 
however  if vsoe is determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements  the company will defer recognition of the full fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize as revenue the remaining portion of the arrangement value through application of the residual method 
evidence of vsoe for implementation and training services is based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for the individuals expected to perform the related services 
installation and training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
the company establishes vsoe for maintenance based upon current contract renewal rates 
the company recognizes maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 
quarterly service revenues from january through june  included  per quarter resulting from the pro rata recognition of certain minimum payments associated with the marketing agreement with entrust 
these minimum payments aggregating  were being recognized as revenue ratably over the four year maximum service period ending in december entrust paid the company a  guaranteed minimum payment in january in july  the company and entrust mutually agreed to terminate their marketing agreement  because the marketing agreement  as structured  no longer served their respective business interests 
in connection with the termination of the marketing agreement  entrust paid the company  and the scheduled minimum guaranteed payments to have been made in and  totaling  were cancelled 
as a result of the termination of this contract service revenues for the third quarter of included  which represents the final revenues to be recognized under this contract 
entrust accounted for of the company s revenues in in  the company organized healthyemail  inc  a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of promoting the responsible use of email in the healthcare sector 
healthyemail  inc and the company have committed to provide zixmail licenses at no cost to physicians and two members of their office staff for a two year period to enable the healthcare industry to meet hipaa privacy requirements  which could potentially have an impact on the company s revenue opportunities and overall sales margins 
the company s end user order backlog as of december   which includes deferred revenue on the company s consolidated balance sheet  increased to approximately  which includes approximately  associated with its newly acquired products and services including electronic prescription solutions  email content filtering and web filtering 
the company s backlog is comprised mainly of service contracts for product maintenance and support  secure messaging  and electronic prescription solutions 
approximately to of this backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue in  reflecting a mix between single and multi year service contracts and the anticipated timing of the deployment of e prescribing services 
the company currently generates revenues from the sale of perpetual software licenses  transaction fees associated with providing e prescription solutions  and service based contracts for product maintenance  secure messaging  and e prescription solutions which are amortized to revenue ratably over their respective service periods 
management uses several general metrics to estimate future revenue growth 
these metrics include technology adoption rates in the markets served by the company  overall order input  renewal rate customer retention of service contracts  mix of single or multi year service contracts and deployment statistics for the company s products and services 
as the market for e prescription solutions matures  the deployment of e prescribing devices to physicians and the prescription volume written by such physicians are important metrics  as the device and its use are a platform for various revenue sources

a significant portion of the company s cost of revenues has not been and is not expected to be directly variable to the revenue generated  such as the cost of operating and maintaining the zixsecure center which is currently not fully utilized 
accordingly  costs associated with the data center are expected to grow at a much slower pace than revenue 
however  cost of revenues also includes the activities of field deployment  professional services and customer service and support  which in the near term are expected to grow at rates substantially equivalent to the company s revenue growth rate 
other than the non cash amortization of the fair value of developed technology acquired with the purchase of elron software  cost of revenues related directly to software sales has not been significant 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in primarily due to decreases in third party consulting expenditures totaling  and reduced employee recruitment expenses of  non cash expenses increased  from  in to  in due to a charge of  for the cost to license certain patents held by tumbleweed communications corp  partially offset by a  reduction in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that became fully depreciated during the net decrease in research and development expenses from to of  is due primarily to a  reduction in non cash expenses consisting primarily of a  decrease in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment resulting from certain computer equipment becoming fully depreciated and a  charge in for the cost to license certain patents held by tumbleweed communications corp

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
long lived assets and goodwill the company s long lived assets  comprised of intangibles and property and equipment aggregating  or of total assets at december   are periodically reviewed for impairment  by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated fair value 
the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cashflow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset 
an impairment charge would be recorded for an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted projected net cash flows 
goodwill  totaling  represents the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in the september acquisition of elron software 
the company will evaluate its goodwill for impairment annually as of october  beginning in  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the business unit to which the goodwill relates to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the unit and market values of comparable businesses where available 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
there has been no change to the carrying amount of goodwill since its origination in september future changes made to the current estimates or assumptions  including such factors as order volumes and price levels  life spans of purchased technology  continuity of acquired customers  alternative uses for property and equipment and levels of operating expenses  could result in an unanticipated impairment charge from the write down of the company s long lived assets or goodwill 
deferred tax assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company recognizes deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheet if it is more likely than not that the subject net operating loss carry forwards and unused tax credits will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
if the company begins to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which its estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized

however  if vsoe is determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements  the company will defer recognition of the full fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize as revenue the remaining portion of the arrangement value through application of the residual method 
evidence of vsoe for implementation and training services is based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for the individuals expected to perform the related services 
installation and training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
the company establishes vsoe for maintenance based upon current contract renewal rates 
the company recognizes maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 
multiple element arrangements 
in the near term  the company expects that a larger percentage of its revenues will be derived from customers purchasing a combination of software under perpetual license agreements and related services including product maintenance and secure messaging services 
the company determines the fair value of each of the contract deliverables using vsoe which requires significant judgment when selling and pricing products and services in emerging markets where increasing competition and technology changes are commonplace 
vsoe for each element is based on the price for which the company will sell the element on a stand alone basis 
if the company determines that it does not have vsoe on an undelivered service element of an arrangement  the company will delay revenue recognition from the software sale and amortize it to revenue ratably over the service period of the related service deliverable 
this occurrence could materially impact our future financial results depending on the significance of software sales to our mix of total revenues 
business acquisitions during  the company completed two acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
the fair values were determined by management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and in one instance a valuation prepared by independent appraisal experts 
the fair values have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have an effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
risks and uncertainties we continue to use significant amounts of cash 
since  we have been developing and marketing products and services that bring privacy  security and convenience to internet users  with a particular focus in the healthcare sector 
our businesses operate in emerging markets  and developing these businesses is costly and the market is highly competitive 
emerging market businesses involve risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts 
we have experienced significant operating losses in recent years and utilization of cash resources continues at a substantial level 
zixcorp anticipates further losses in our recent acquisitions of three companies may require us to invest significant resources to make them successful 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of pocketscript  a provider of electronic prescription solutions for the healthcare industry  in september  we acquired substantially all of the assets of elron software  a provider of anti spam  email content filtering and web filtering solutions  and in late january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of mydoconline  a provider of secure web based communications and laboratory information solutions 
pocketscript and mydoconline are start up ventures in emerging markets 
while elron has been in business for a number of years  its revenues have declined in recent years 
pocketscript  elron  and mydoconline have incurred operating losses in recent years 
the ability to increase the companies revenues in the near future is largely dependent upon  in elron s case  whether our efforts to bring enhanced and new products to market are successful  and in the case of pocketscript and mydoconline  whether we are able to develop the market for their products and services 
our challenge is to make these new subsidiaries profitable 
to do so may require us to invest significant resources  including significant amounts of cash  and there are no assurances that these subsidiaries will become profitable in the near term 
the market may not broadly accept our products and services  which would prevent us from operating profitably 
we must be able to achieve broad market acceptance for our products and services in order to operate profitably 
we have not yet been able to do this 
to our knowledge  there are currently no secure e messaging protection and transaction businesses similar to our zix branded business that currently operates at the scale that we would require  at our current expenditure levels and pricing  to become profitable 
as previously noted  pocketscript and mydoconline are start up ventures in emerging markets 
there is no assurance that our products and services will become generally accepted or that they will be compatible with any standards that become generally accepted  nor is there any assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate profitably 
competition in our businesses is expected to increase  which could cause our business including the business of our recently acquired subsidiaries to fail 
our zix branded solutions are targeted to the secure e messaging protection and transaction services market 
elron s product solutions have enabled us to enhance our zix branded protection management 
table of contents services by adding a new feature set to our anti virus  anti spam and email content filtering services while expanding our offering to include url filtering 
our pocketscript and mydoconline businesses are targeted toward the emerging markets for electronic prescriptions and online communication among the healthcare community 
as the public s and governmental authorities awareness about the need for privacy and security of electronic communications has increased over the past few years  an increasing number of competitors have entered the market 
although there are many large  well funded participants in the information technology security industry  few currently participate in the secure e messaging protection and transaction services market in which our zix branded solutions compete 
most other product only solutions in this market require extensive increases in overhead to implement and deploy them 
in addition  our zix branded solutions can be made operational in a very short period of time compared to the longer procurement and deployment cycles common with the solutions of many of our competitors 
our service and product offerings are focused on the secure communications market  including secure e messaging and protection management 
companies that compete with our zix branded secure e messaging and protection business include content management and secure delivery companies  such as authentica  inc  certified mail  sigaba corporation and tumbleweed communications corp  and other messaging spam protection participants such as brightmail incorporated  ciphertrust  inc  clearswift limited  frontbridge technologies  inc  messagelabs  postini  inc  netiq corp 
and surfcontrol incorporated 
our zix branded products and elron products also compete with several product companies that deliver anti virus solutions that may also contain limited email messaging spam protection capabilities  including network associates  inc mcafee  sophos  inc  symantec corporation and trend micro  inc we also compete with companies that offer web filtering products  such as secure computing corporation  surfcontrol incorporated  websense  inc and netiq corp 
in addition  we face competition from vendors of internet server appliances  operating systems  networking hardware  network management solutions and security software  many of which now  or may in the future  develop or bundle secure e messaging  messaging spam protection and or web filtering capabilities into their products 
we may face increased competition as these competitors partner with others or develop new product and service offerings to expand the functionality that they can offer to their customers 
we believe that the secure e messaging protection and transaction services market is immature  and  for the most part  unpenetrated  unlike many segments of the information technology security industry which are saturated 
we have spent several years on infrastructure development and product development 
our competitors may  over time  develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective or cost efficient than our own 
if we are not successful in exploiting the technology advantage we believe we currently hold  these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of our company 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could harm our business 
our pocketscript electronic prescription management services allow health care payors to effectively deliver drug information to physicians at the point of care  enabling providers to work more effectively within established formularies 
our pocketscript services  targeted to the e prescription marketplace  are expected to grow as more physicians are leveraging technology in delivering healthcare services  coupled with the fact that the number of prescriptions written annually in the united states continues to increase 
participants in the e prescribing space include allscripts healthcare solutions  ramp corporation  dr 
first  inc and iscribe a division of advancepcs 
our recently acquired mydoconline business offers a variety of internet based healthcare services 
mydoconline connect is a subscription based web service that allows patients and physicians to securely communicate online 
connect helps patients become more active  informed participants in their own health 
communication features offered by the service cover the spectrum of patient needs and include online doctor visits  administrative questions  appointment requests  billing questions  prescription requests  and referral requests 
the service also offers a host of educational  interactive content features that deliver condition 
table of contents specific health information to patients 
connect competitors include medem  inc  relayhealth corporation and medfusion  inc 
with respect to the communication features  and webmd corporation with respect to the content resources 
we believe that connect offers superior services in the online doctor visit arena with the comprehensiveness of the templates  its ability to intelligently evaluate symptoms  interface with electronic medical records  control template availability at a granular level  and enable patients to include their health history  and its compatibility with the vast number of business financial arrangements that exist in the healthcare industry 
nevertheless  we expect to face increasing competition in this arena and our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived to be better than ours 
dr 
chart  also a web based communication tool  connects healthcare providers and laboratories by allowing doctors to initiate lab orders  check medical necessity compliance and view results rapidly and accurately using a secure internet connection 
dr 
chart also automatically integrates patient information  customizes requisition formats for individual practices  automatically prints specimen labels  automatically checks medicare compliance and provides an up front advanced beneficiary notification abn at point of order and allows labs to enhance reporting with historical analyses  trending  and graphing 
dr 
chart seamlessly integrates into labs current systems and is fully customizable 
competitors include medica  inc  cerner corporation and misys plc 
all of the competitors offer the same basic services that dr 
chart offers  although we believe that dr 
chart is superior to services offered by its competitors because of the flexibility of the product  expertise in interfacing to other systems  and duration and breadth of experience delivering internet based orders and solutions to labs nationwide 
nevertheless  we expect to face increasing competition in this arena and our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived to be better than ours 
our inability to successfully and timely develop and introduce new e messaging protection and transaction products and related services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the emerging nature of the secure e messaging protection and transaction services business and its rapid evolution  require us continually to develop and introduce new products and services and to improve the performance  features and reliability of our existing products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our elron business  while having a significant customer base and meaningful revenues  has not been profitable in recent years under its prior ownership 
we also have under development new feature sets for our current zix branded product line and service offerings and are considering new secure e messaging products and services 
by adding elron s product line to our current service offerings  we will be able to accelerate the development time we would have otherwise needed to build additional feature sets into our zix branded product and service offerings 
the success of new or enhanced products and services depends on several factors primarily  market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced products and services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could harm our business 
if the market for secure e messaging protection and transaction services does not continue to grow  demand for our products and services will be adversely affected 
the market for secure electronic communications is a developing market 
continued growth of the secure e messaging protection and transaction services market will depend to a large extent on the market recognizing the need for secure electronic communications  such as email encryption and e prescribing 
failure of this market to grow would harm our business 
if health care providers fail to adopt the pocketscript and mydoconline care delivery solutions  we will fail to achieve the critical mass of physicians and patients to build a successful business 
our pocketscript electronic prescription management services and our mydoconline services are targeted to the emerging market for providing secure communications among healthcare providers to deliver information in an efficient  economical manner 
these are emerging markets  and the success of our 
table of contents pocketscript and mydoconline services is dependent  in large measure  on physicians and other healthcare providers changing the manner in which they conduct their medical practices by beginning to use secure wireless and internet communications channels to communicate with their patients  medical laboratories  payors  drug formularies  and others 
our challenge is to make these new businesses profitable 
to do so may require us to invest significant resources  including significant amounts of cash  and there are no assurances that these businesses will become profitable in the near term 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point we may be required to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage on our network  particularly since we have significantly expanded our potential customer base by our recent acquisition of pocketscript and mydoconline  whose service offerings will be supported by our zixsecure center  once we transition the data center operations of pocketscript and mydoconline to this facility 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and upgrade  in a timely manner  our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not timely and appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our data centers could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our products and services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our centers currently  our zixsecure center located in dallas  texas  the austin  texas data center used for fail over and staging of new customers of our zix branded services  the dallas  texas co location facility that supports the operations of our recently acquired mydoconline business  and the data center that supports the pocketscript operations 
we must protect these centers from loss  damage or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other events beyond our control 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our data centers operations could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to issue digitally signed certified time stamps and public encryption codes in connection with our zix branded products and services and to support pocketscript s e prescribing services and mydoconline s services depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data centers 
we depend on internet service providers efficiently operating these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 
furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events  therefore  it is possible that we may have to use additional resources to address these problems 
secure messages sent through our zixport and zixmessage center messaging portals  in connection with the operation of our secure e messaging protection and transaction services  will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network  individual prescription histories transmitted through our pocketscript system will reside in our secure data center network  and the personal healthcare information transmitted through our mydoconline system will reside in our secure data center network 
any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our internet related products and services 

table of contents we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our products and services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing products or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and services 
we subject our zix branded products and services to quality assurance testing prior to product release 
there is no assurance that the quality and assurance testing previously conducted by the businesses we recently acquired on their current products and services conform to our standards for quality assurance testing 
regardless of the level of quality assurance testing  any of our products and services could contain undetected defects or errors 
this could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs 
any of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our zix branded products and services  the pocketscript e prescription service and the mydoconline businesses employ  and future products and services may employ  public key cryptography technology 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends  in large measure  on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption products using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such products could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our products  which could damage our reputation and otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  there have been public reports of the successful decryption of certain encrypted messages 
this  or related  publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by public key cryptography technology  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our chairman and chief executive officer  john a 
ryan  our president and chief operating officer  richard spurr and their direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees which prevent them from leaving our company at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software products using encryption technology  such as our zix branded products and services  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our products to almost all countries in the world  the list of countries to which our products cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some foreign countries impose restrictions on the use of 
table of contents encryption products  such as our products 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our products in international markets 
furthermore  boards of pharmacy in the various states in which our pocketscript and mydoconline businesses operate regulate the process by which physicians write prescriptions 
while regulations in the states in which these businesses currently generally operate permit the electronic writing of prescriptions  such regulations could be revised in the future 
moreover  regulations in states in which these businesses do not currently operate may not be as favorable and may impede our ability to develop business in these states 
furthermore  future state or federal regulation could mandate standards for the electronic writing of prescriptions or for the secure electronic transmittal of personal health information through the internet that our technology and systems do not comply with  which would require us to modify our technology and systems 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
our stock price may decrease as a result of the dilutive effect caused by the additional number of shares that may become available in the market due to the issuances of our common stock in connection with the capital funding and acquisition transactions we completed over the last year 
as of february   there was a short position in our common stock of  shares 
our directors and executive officers own a substantial percentage of our securities 
their ownership could allow them to exercise significant control over corporate decisions and to implement corporate acts that are not in the best interests of our shareholders as a group 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own shares of our securities that represent approximately of the combined voting power eligible to vote on matters brought before our shareholders  including securities and associated warrants beneficially owned by antonio r 
sanchez  jr  a former director and father of a current director antonio r 
sanchez iii  and current beneficial owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock  and john a 
ryan  our chairman and chief executive officer 
therefore  our directors and executive officers  if they acted together  could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders 
these matters would include the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business 
a private investor owns a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
george w 
haywood  a private investor  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
therefore  mr 
haywood could exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
mr 
haywood s interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current shareholders 
at some point in the future we may determine to seek additional capital funding or to acquire additional businesses 
these events could involve the issuance of one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common or convertible preferred stock and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock 
in addition  we incentivize employees and attract new employees by issuing options to purchase our shares of common stock 
therefore  the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted by future stock option grants to employees and any equity securities issued in capital funding financings or business acquisitions 

table of contents we may have liability for indemnification claims arising from the sale of our previous businesses in and we disposed of our previous operating businesses in and in selling those businesses  we agreed to provide customary indemnification to the purchasers of those businesses for breaches of representations and warranties  covenants and other specified matters 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for future costs associated with these indemnification obligations  indemnifiable claims could exceed our estimates 
we may encounter other unanticipated risks and uncertainties in the markets we serve or in developing new products and services  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding to any unanticipated risks or uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it faces material market risk with respect to its cash investments and marketable securities  which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
these investments  which mature at various dates through june  primarily consist of commercial paper  daily money market funds  asset backed securities and a us government security  and do not include derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments as such terms are defined by the sec in applicable regulations 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s operating results or cash flows due to the short term  high credit quality nature of the company s cash investments and marketable securities
