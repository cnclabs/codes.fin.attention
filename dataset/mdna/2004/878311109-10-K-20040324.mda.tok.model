item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as an it and business process support services provider  we provide our customers with assistance in designing  implementing  managing  and maintaining their it infrastructure and computer systems through our provision of technical help desk services  technical staffing  systems integration  professional services  and training programs 
techteam s operating results reflect a challenging economic environment as our customers strive to reduce their costs and exhibit cautious spending patterns 
as a result  we continue to focus on executing operating and financial strategies which improve our operating performance and shareholder returns 
we achieved revenue growth  or million  in in our corporate services segment  comprised of corporate help desk services  technical staffing  systems integration  and training programs  but suffered a decrease in gross profit from our corporate services segment of  or million  primarily due to continued downward pricing pressure and staffing reductions from ford and some of our larger customers  the loss of certain business to competitors  and new contracts with less favorable pricing terms than we have realized in the past 
the most significant of the aforementioned price concessions and staffing reductions occurred at ford where our revenue was adversely impacted by approximately million 
however  we believe that our willingness to work as a partner with ford has strengthened our relationship  and we expect additional new business with ford in revenue from our european operations increased  or million  in  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the united states of  or million  in  excluding revenue from our leasing operations 
our help desk services business achieved revenue growth of  or million  in but gross profit decreased  or million  in due to the aforementioned reasons 
we incurred a total company operating loss of million primarily due to our leasing business and expenses incurred to support the rapid expansion of our european operations 
as noted  the trend toward reduced pricing for help desk services continued in  and it had an adverse effect on our revenue and gross profit during we were able to address some of the price pressure by increasing operational efficiencies in providing services to our customers  but given the increasing prevalence of offshore help desk service providers  we recognized the need to establish our own offshore presence 
during  we explored the advantages and disadvantages of establishing an offshore presence in various countries 
we concluded that establishing operations in romania presented the best opportunity for increasing our operating performance because the technical support personnel in romania have solid skills  romanians can provide support services in the major western european languages  developing a blended solution with our belgian operation would provide operational efficiencies  thereby improving the gross margin of our existing business  and the cost of conducting business in romania was comparable to other possible locations we explored 
we expect our romanian call center to be providing support services in the french  english  spanish  italian  and german languages in april we also created an entity in india  which is currently non operational  and we are working with an indian company with a call center in india on new business opportunities 
as part of our long term strategic plan  we are also committed to further expanding our footprint in the it systems integration sector 
we believe the further development of infrastructure support services is an important aspect of our sales strategy as it provides services that have a shorter sales cycle than help desk services 
in december  we purchased digital support corporation  a provider of diversified information technology services and solutions  including network infrastructure  information assurance  enterprise application  healthcare technology  systems integration  and hardware services and solutions to various governmental and commercial customers 
dsc is expected to make a positive earnings contribution to techteam in results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue the company s total revenue increased to million in  from million in revenue from corporate services increased to million in  from million in this growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our leasing operations segment  which decreased to million in  from million in the decline in leasing operations revenue was the result of our decision in march to discontinue actively seeking new leasing business and to commence the wind down of our lease portfolio 
the trend of reduced revenue from our leasing operations will continue over the next year depending on the size and duration of renewals 
the increase in revenue from corporate services was primarily due to revenue growth in europe of to million in  from million in the growth in revenue in europe was primarily due to additional business from existing customers in our corporate help desk services segment  efforts to expand our multilingual help desk capabilities in europe  and the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound 
the weakening of the us dollar relative to these european currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately million during since most of our international operating expenses were incurred in local currencies  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating income was considerably less than the impact on revenue 
if the us dollar strengthens in relative to european currencies  our international revenue will be negatively impacted when translated into us dollars 
the revenue growth in europe was offset by a decrease in revenue from corporate services in the united states of to million in  from million in the decrease in revenue in the united states is primarily due to price concessions granted to existing customers in our corporate help desk services and technical staffing segments  and a reduction in placements in our technical staffing segment with ford  our largest customer 
the price concessions and staffing reductions adversely affected total company revenue by approximately million  with the majority of this effect in the united states 
revenue from corporate help desk services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from existing customers in europe  which was partially offset by decreased revenue as a result of price concessions granted to existing customers 
revenue from our belgian operation increased to million in  from million in  due to growth in our existing customer base and the aforementioned weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro 
the strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar positively impacted revenue in belgium by approximately million during revenue from technical staffing services decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to price concessions granted to ford and staffing reductions  which were only partially offset by additional business received from ford in europe 
revenue from systems integration services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from existing customers  including ford 
revenue from training programs decreased to  in  from million in  due to a reduction in training programs at daimlerchrysler  our largest customer in our training programs segment and our second largest customer overall 
gross profit total company gross profit decreased to million in  from million in total company gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in the decrease in gross profit dollars and margin is primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from corporate help desk services and leasing operations 
gross profit loss from our leasing operations decreased to million in  from  in  primarily due to non cash charges totaling million to increase our reserves for off lease equipment 
during  we determined that we would not be able to obtain the value previously expected from the sale of off lease equipment inventories due to a significant decline in the fair market value of computer equipment in the secondary market 
at december   we have sold or disposed of substantially all inventories as our lease portfolio continues to wind down 
all remaining inventories are fully reserved by a valuation allowance as we believe these items have little  if any  re sale value in the secondary market 
gross profit from corporate help desk services decreased to million in  from million in gross profit from corporate help desk services as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in the decrease in gross profit dollars and margin was primarily due to price concessions granted to existing customers in multi year contracts negotiated during and  costs associated with the launch of new business and our expanded help desk in belgium  and expenses related to re aligning our cost structure in our european operations 
we expect our gross profit from corporate help desk services will improve as the new business matures and the benefits of our expansion in europe  in particular romania  are realized beginning in the fourth quarter of or early gross profit from technical staffing increased to million in  from million in gross profit from technical staffing as a percentage of revenue increased to in  from in the increase in gross profit dollars and margin was primarily due to additional business from ford in europe and the success of internal cost reduction efforts 
gross profit from systems integration services increased to million in  from million in gross profit from systems integration services as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to in  from in the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to additional business from new and existing customers 
gross profit from training programs decreased to  in  from  in gross profit from training programs as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in the decrease in gross profit dollars and margin was due to a reduction in training programs with daimlerchrysler  our largest training customer 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in  from million in costs which increased include  but are not limited to  approximately  for bad debt expense primarily from three customers who declared bankruptcy in  our investment in the expansion of belgium and romania  a full year s impact of the costs for our office in sweden that we opened in of approximately  and expenses incurred in reviewing acquisitions of businesses that we ultimately decided not to acquire of approximately  these increases were partially offset by various decreases including  but not limited to  reduced michigan single business tax of approximately  reduced rent expense of approximately  from less square footage being leased  and internal cost containment efforts 
interest income increased to million in  from  in  due to higher average cash balances maintained in our investment yield was consistent from to  which averaged in both periods 
interest expense decreased to  in  from  in  due to reduced outstanding debt related to our leasing operations 
foreign currency transaction gains increased to  in  from  in  primarily due to the significant weakening of the us dollar in relative to the euro and british pound and higher average liabilities at our european subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the local currency  principally in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthens in relative to european currencies  we expect to recognize foreign currency losses and the amounts could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our effective tax rate increased in from in primarily due to our inability to recognize a future tax benefit of  on losses incurred in belgium 
this increase was partially offset by a tax benefit of  that we recognized related to a refund of federal income taxes paid in the united states in prior years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue decreased to million in  from million in this decline was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from leasing operations of to million in  from million in  as a result of our decision in march to discontinue actively seeking new leasing business and to commence the wind down of our lease portfolio 
revenue from corporate help desk services increased to million in  from million in  due to growth in business with our existing customers  primarily ford  and new business acquired with the acquisition of cyntergy corporation in september revenue from systems integration services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to growth of our customer base associated with the acquisition of cyntergy corporation 
revenue from technical staffing decreased to million in  from million in  principally as the result of price concessions granted to existing customers and reductions in staff placements 
revenue from training programs decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to discontinuance of training contracts with sun microsystems  inc and daimlerchrysler 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in  from in this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit margin from our leasing operations to in from in these benefits were partially offset by a gross margin reduction from corporate services to in  from in within corporate services  gross profit as a percentage of revenue from our corporate help desk services segment decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increased cost of services delivered in expanding the customer use of our support portal  gross profit as a percentage of revenue from technical staffing decreased to in  from in  primarily due to price concessions granted to existing customers  and gross profit as a percentage of revenue from systems integration decreased to in  from in  as we invested in integrating new customers from our acquisition of cyntergy corporation 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from training to in  from in selling  general  and administrative expense decreased to million in  from million in the expense decrease is partially due to aggressive cost containment efforts and expense reduction initiatives undertaken during that reduced  among other things  facility costs  outside services  payroll  and benefits expense 
these decreases were partially offset by increases for depreciation  travel expenses  and the non cash charge of  resulting from a variable stock option grant made to our president and chief executive officer pursuant to an employment agreement entered into on august  also  we did not amortize goodwill during due to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  we recognized million in goodwill amortization expense during selling  general  and administrative expense in also included costs related to earn out and release agreements with former officers of capital group  higher bad debt expense  severance expenses associated with terminated employees  and higher amortization expense for intangible assets 
interest income decreased to  in  from million in  as a result of reduced returns from our cash investments 
the decline in our investment yield was consistent with the overall decline in short term market interest rates and returns 
interest expense decreased significantly to  in  from  in  primarily due to reduced outstanding debt related to our leasing operations 
our effective tax rate increased to in from primarily due to increased taxable income and expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes in the united states 
as required  on january   we adopted sfas and no longer amortize goodwill beginning in  but are required to subject goodwill to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
upon adoption of sfas  we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of january  we first compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit  as that term is defined by sfas  with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
upon completing this first step  we identified our leasing operations reporting segment whose carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million representing the remaining carrying value of this goodwill  which was recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as of january  the goodwill related to our leasing operations segment became impaired primarily due to our decision to exit the leasing business and a significant decline in the fair market value of the leased equipment in the secondary market 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income does not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is provided 
based on historical and expected future taxable income in belgium  we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward 
we anticipate providing a valuation allowance for any future losses incurred in belgium 
no valuation allowance has been recognized against other deferred tax assets  which are in the united states  as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of future taxable income  which have considered  among other factors  the future benefits of our recent acquisition of dsc and the wind down of our leasing operation 
no provision was made with respect to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at december   since we consider these earnings to be permanently reinvested 
upon distribution of these earnings  we would be subject to united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability on the distribution of these earnings is not practicable as such liability  if any  is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs 
assets of leasing operations assets of leasing operations consist of equipment leased to others under operating leases and our net investment in direct financing leases 
equipment leased to others consists primarily of computer equipment 
leased assets are depreciated to their estimated residual value using the straight line method over the original term of the lease 
furthermore  our net investment in direct financing leases contains an amount for estimated non guaranteed residuals from these leases 
in estimating all residual values  we rely largely on historical experience by type of equipment and manufacturer  adjusted for known trends and current market valuation data 
we periodically review our estimate of residual values 
the residual values are impacted by a number of factors  including the speed of technological change  the secondary market for used computer equipment  the disposition of customers towards lease renewals  and our ability to offer structured alternatives to our customers 
during  we determined that certain estimated residual values were overstated due to a decline in the fair market value of the equipment in the secondary market 
in recognition of the deterioration in market prices  we recorded valuation reserves against the residual value of leased assets of approximately  in at december   the carrying value of equipment leased to others totaled  which will become fully depreciated in with minimal estimated residual value 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are reserved when we determine they are more likely than not to become uncollectible 
our customers are generally large  well capitalized entities 
we generally do not require collateral and do not charge interest on past due balances 
as our leasing portfolio winds down  additional collection challenges may be encountered 
our experience with delinquent accounts was adversely impacted by the bankruptcy of three customers in the third and fourth quarters of  which continue to reflect the challenging economic conditions of our industry 
one customer was a former reseller of our leased equipment  one customer related to our corporate help desk services segment  and one customer was indebted to the company as a result of a note receivable acquired with our acquisition of certain assets of cyntergy corporation in we are not aware of major financial difficulties at any major customer and do not anticipate large uncollectible accounts in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million primarily due to million in cash used to repurchase  shares of our common stock  million in cash used in the acquisition of dsc on december   and million in cash used for capital expenditures 
these decreases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by million in cash provided by operations  million from the sale of marketable securities  and million in proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
a significant source of operating cash flow in and  and to a lesser extent in  was our leasing business  as cash rental income and non cash depreciation and amortization expense comprised substantially all of our operating activities 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  of which million was derived from our leasing operations 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  of which million came from our leasing operations 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  of which million was derived from our leasing operations 
operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million in due to our growth in europe as working capital grew along with our revenue 
capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in the increase in capital spending was the result of our expansion in europe and continued investment in newer technologies and infrastructure support 
we expect our capital expenditures in to be at a comparable level to the company purchased shares of its common stock in connection with various authorized stock repurchase programs 
in  we purchased and retired  shares of common stock for  inclusive of commission expense 
in  we purchased and retired  shares of common stock for  inclusive of commission expense 
in  we purchased  shares of common stock for  inclusive of commission expense 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock in long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the continued expansion in europe  enhancements of existing technologies  repurchases of our common stock  additional consideration that is payable to the selling shareholders of dsc if specific performance conditions and operating targets are met in and  and the possible acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s existing business 
we believe that positive cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances  will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and stock repurchases for the next twelve months and foreseeable future 
we have historically not paid dividends and intend to continue our policy of retaining earnings to finance future growth 
the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding at december redeemable convertible preferred operating maturities of contractual obligations debt stock leases less than one year  years   years  thereafter  total   factors influencing future results impact of business with major clients as set forth in item business  we depend upon major clients in the automotive industry for a substantial portion of our revenue 
the past two years have been difficult financially for our automotive clients  and further deterioration of their financial condition could have a material adverse impact on our business as they may seek further price concessions or the termination of projects 
similarly  the loss of any significant customer or a reduction in economic activity in the automotive industry would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
competition we face intense competition in all of our markets and for all of our services  including the help desk and call center services markets 
some competitors have substantially greater resources  including more locations  greater financial resources  a larger client base  and greater name and brand recognition 
these customers may be willing to provide the same services that we do at a loss in order to attain other  more lucrative business with our customers 
due to this competition  it may be difficult for us to grow our revenue outside of our current customer base 
also  as a result  we have experienced and continue to anticipate significant downward pricing pressure from our customers in order to remain a preferred vendor 
these pressures will likely increase due to the trend to move outsourcing services offshore to countries with lower labor costs  such as india  malaysia  and the philippines 
our inability to develop and execute a strategy to address the globalization of the support services market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to maintain and grow our current customers and expand our customer base 
further  we may have to continue to lower the prices of our services to stay competitive  while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin 
if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures  our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
contract risks the great majority of our non leasing related contracts  including our ford spoc program help desk contract  may be terminated without cause on short notice  often upon as little as days notice 
terminations and non renewals of major contracts could have a material adverse impact upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  increasing portions of our projects are billed on a managed service basis where the fee is fixed to perform specified services as opposed to time and materials 
the onset of problems in our customers infrastructure  such as computer viruses  may require us to deploy additional resources to solve the problem 
in many instances  we would not receive any additional revenue for the work performed 
some of our contracts do not contain minimum guaranteed volume  so we may not always receive enough volume to pay for our costs on a specific contract 
also  many of our contracts contain financial penalties for our failure to meet the contractual performance service levels 
to the extent we provide service on a per incident or per minute basis  our financial performance is dependent upon the volume of service requests that we receive 
if the volume is low  we will have too many technicians to efficiently handle the requests 
if the volume is too high  we may not be able to meet the service levels 
in the united states  we are able to manage this risk through changes in our staffing  but our european entities do not have as much flexibility in staffing 
our inability to estimate accurately the resources and related expenses required for the managed service project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the contractual obligations could materially and adversely affect the business 
furthermore  with our acquisition of dsc  we now provide services to the us department of defense 
maintaining and growing this business is dependent upon maintaining the appropriate security clearance required to perform the work 
the failure to maintain this clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the us federal government also has the right to cancel contracts or impose additional terms and conditions 
reliance on senior management the success of the company is highly dependent upon the efforts  direction  and guidance of its senior management 
the only employment agreements that we currently have with the executive officers of the company are with the president and chief executive officer and the vice president sales and marketing  emea 
except for employment agreements relating to a change of control  which only apply to a change in the control of the company  we do not have any other employment agreements with other members of our executive officer team 
the loss of any of these senior executives or our inability to attract  retain  or replace key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
attraction and retention of employees our business involves the delivery of professional services and is very labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  develop  motivate  and retain highly skilled technical  clerical  and administrative employees 
qualified personnel are in high demand 
accordingly  we expect to experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either increased productivity or higher customer pricing 
moreover  no assurances can be given that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future  especially when we need to expand our services in a short time period 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
interruption of telecommunications and network our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technical support centers and our information databases against damages that may be caused by fire and other disasters  power failure  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  computer viruses  and other emergencies 
the temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
notwithstanding precautions we have taken to protect ourselves and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of our services  there can be no assurance that a fire  natural disaster  human error  equipment malfunction or inadequacy  computer virus  firewall breach  or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients 
as we commence delivering services from an offshore location  the risks attendant to interruption of telecommunications increase 
any interruption to our data or voice telecommunications networks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and our results of operations 
our primary telecommunications service provider is mci  which is currently operating under the provisions of chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
while we have created redundant networks  and the united states government has indicated that they will not allow mci to cease operations  there are no assurances that our telecommunications services will continue without interruption 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
technological changes  dependence on technology and computer systems our success depends in part on our ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in it  evolving industry standards  and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  we will be successful in the marketplace 
for example  our support portal offering is comprised of our proprietary incident management tool and software developed and sold by software companies 
over the past three years  we have integrated this software into the support portal 
during this time  there have been other tools developed by other competitors and software vendors that can match the functionality of the support portal 
if these other tools can provide similar or better functionality at a lower effective cost  or if our software vendors go out of business  we could have a product and service offering that will lose its marketability 
in order to diversify our tool set  we have also purchased a customer relationship management crm tool from a major software vendor 
if we are unable to develop and use this tool profitably  it may become impaired 
our inability to effectively and profitably keep pace with continuing changes in the it industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
as a result  we could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by security breaches of our network 
moreover  we could lose existing or potential customers for information technology outsourcing services or other information technology solutions  or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures 
in addition  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service that may impede sales  manufacturing  distribution or other critical functions 
management of growth by acquisition our business strategy includes the attainment of significant growth through expanding our customer base and through the company s potential acquisitions 
any time there is significant growth from new customers  there are risks associated with the launch and management of new projects  including but not limited to  proper project management  staff development  and scoping of the work 
in order to pursue a growth by acquisition strategy successfully  we must identify suitable candidates for these transactions  complete these transactions  and manage post closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees 
integration issues are complex  time consuming and expensive and  without proper planning and implementation  could significantly disrupt our business  including  but not limited to  the diversion of management s attention  the loss of key business and or personnel from the acquired company  unanticipated events  legal liabilities  dilutive effect of the issuance of additional securities  and amortization of intangibles 
moreover  the financial risks continue after the integration of the company 
if the business becomes impaired  there could be a non cash partial or full write off of the goodwill attributed to the acquisition 
transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings  including those related to severance pay  early retirement costs  employee benefit costs  asset impairment charges  charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts  in process research and development charges  inventory adjustments  legal  accounting and financial advisory fees  and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 
any of these possible difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
economic weakness our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for our services in the markets in which we compete 
softened demand for our services caused by economic weakness and constrained information technology spending over the past several years has resulted  and may result in the future  in decreased revenue  gross margin  earnings or growth rates  and problems with our ability to realize customer receivables 
in addition  customer financial difficulties have resulted  and could in the future result  in increases in bad debt write offs and additions to reserves in our receivables portfolio  inability by our lessees to make required lease payments  and reduction in the value of leased equipment upon its return to us compared to the value estimated at lease inception 
economic difficulties also have led to restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of our investment portfolio 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations  prospects  and stock price 
terrorism terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to techteam  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers  or customers  which could adversely impact our revenue  costs and expenses  and financial condition 
risks associated with international operations certain risks are inherent in our business strategy  which includes plans for the global expansion of our operations 
sales outside the united states are a significant aspect of our revenue 
our future revenue  gross margin  expenses  and financial condition could also suffer due to a variety of international factors  including the following changes in a country s or region s economic or political conditions  including inflation  recession  interest rate fluctuations  and actual or anticipated military conflicts  currency fluctuations  particularly in the euro  which contribute to variations in sales of services in impacted jurisdictions and also affect our reported results expressed in us dollars  longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers  local labor conditions and regulations  differences in cultures and languages  differing political and social systems  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  differing technology standards or customer requirements  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and changes in tax laws  fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry  and natural and medical disasters 
any of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks in offshore markets there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully expand into and conduct business in offshore markets 
the industry trend to move business towards offshore markets could result in the company s having excess operating capacity in the united states  thereby increasing competition for customers 
moreover  the success of any offshore operation is subject to numerous contingencies  some of which are beyond management control  including general and regional economic conditions  prices for our services  competition  changes in regulation  and other risks 
any failure in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see risks associated with international operations 
moreover  as developing offshore markets take jobs from developed countries  there may be political pressure against offshore outsourcing that could materially impair our ability to profitably maintain this strategy 
health care and other benefit costs health care and other benefit costs continue to increase 
while we attempt to compensate for these escalating costs in our business cost models and customer pricing and have passed along some of these increased costs to our employees  we have long term  generally fixed price pricing agreements with our customers 
risks inherent in leasing the capital group leasing portfolio is largely wound down  and we anticipate that we will be receiving approximately  in contractually committed lease revenue from the portfolio during however  as the actual amount of revenue is dependent upon the renewals that we receive  and we cannot predict the number of renewals that we will receive  the actual revenue we receive could be greater 
also  we will continue to receive equipment from the lessees as the leases end  and it is difficult to determine the value of this equipment at the expiration of the lease 
if we are able to sell the equipment to the original lessee or to third parties quickly  our proceeds are usually greater than we would otherwise receive by disposing of these assets through other means 
accordingly  variations in lease renewals and in the sale price of off lease equipment will lead to fluctuations in the performance of capital group  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
limited protection of proprietary systems and procedures we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets  copyright  and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  and suppliers and limit distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of such information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
although we believe our services and or software do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all of the rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business  we are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require us to spend significant sums of money in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses of the intellectual property  which may be the subject of asserted infringement 
volatility of stock price the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including  among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock  public float in our common stock  quarterly variations in our operating results  actual versus anticipated operating results  growth rates  market conditions in the industry in which we compete  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions  litigation including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
as a result of the foregoing  our operating results and future prospects at various times may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are subject to market exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not have any material market risk related to interest rates as our debt obligations have fixed interest rates and short lives 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments 
we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations as we provide services in the united states and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies specifically the euro  british pound  and swedish kroner 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international subsidiaries affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
at december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates yet exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency
