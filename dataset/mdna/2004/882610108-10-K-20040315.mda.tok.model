item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
period to period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative  and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators  of the trust s future performance 
words or phrases such as does not believe and believes  or similar expressions  when used in this form k or other filings with the sec  are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of results of operations the trust s primary sources of income are revenue derived from sales of land  either for cash or a combination of cash and mortgage notes  and revenue derived from the trust s land and mineral interests 
revenue from sales of land declined by  or  in compared to however  this decline in revenue from sales of land was more than offset by increases in revenue from the trust s land and mineral royalties 
as a result  the trust s gross income for increased by  or  compared to the trust s revenue for included  of oil and gas royalties for past production resulting from an audit of an oil and gas lease and  of sundry income resulting from settlement of claims with respect to three other oil and gas leases 
as is its tradition  the trust continued to purchase and retire sub shares  with  sub shares being purchased and retired during  leaving  sub shares outstanding at december  earnings per sub share certificate for were compared to in and in total revenues in were  in  and in  land sales in were  compared to  in and  in a total of  acres were sold in at an average price of per acre  compared to  acres in and  acres in at average prices per acre of and  respectively 
land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the total dollar amount  the average price per acre  and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of land sales in the future 
the trust is a passive seller of land and does not actively solicit sales of land 
the demand for  and the sales price of  any particular tract of the trust s land is influenced by many factors  including  the national and local economies  the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas  livestock carrying capacity  and the condition of the local agricultural industry  which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and other agricultural products 
approximately of the trust s land is classified as ranch land and intermingled with other ownerships to form ranching units 
ranch land sales are  therefore  largely dependent on the actions of the adjoining landowners 
rentals  royalties and other income were  in  compared to  in and  in oil and gas royalty revenue in was  compared to  in and  in as noted above  the revenue figure includes  related to past production which resulted from an audit of an oil and gas lease 
oil royalty revenue was  and gas royalty revenue was  in crude oil production from trust royalty wells increased in and the average price for crude oil increased 
total gas production decreased in  but this decrease in the volume of gas production was more than offset by a increase in the average price for gas during compared to the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil for   and was   and  respectively 
the trust s oil and gas royalty income is from perpetual non participating royalty interests 
the trust has no control over changes in production or prices of oil and gas 
interest revenue was  in  compared to  in and  in interest on notes receivable amounted to  in  compared to  in  and  in at year end  notes receivable from land sales were  compared to  in and  in sundry interest amounted to  in   in  and  in total principal cash payments on notes receivable were  in easement and sundry income revenue in was  compared to  in and  in the significant increase for was primarily due to  received as a result of a settlement of claims with respect to three oil and gas leases 
taxes  other than federal income taxes  were  in compared to  in and  in oil and gas production taxes were  in compared to  in and  in ad valorem taxes were  in compared to  in and  in basis in real estate sold was  in   in  and  in all other expenses were  in   in  and  in liquidity the trust s principal sources of liquidity are its revenues from oil and gas royalties  lease rentals and receipts of interest and principal payments on the notes receivable arising from its sales of land 
in the past these sources have generated more than adequate amounts of cash to meet the trust s needs and  in the opinion of management  should continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements the trust has not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations as of december   the trust s known contractural obligations were as follows payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations   purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the trust s balance sheet under gaap total   critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements 
consistent with our disclosure policies we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
valuation of notes receivable management of the trust monitors delinquencies to assess the propriety of the carrying value of its notes receivable 
at the point in time that notes receivable become delinquent  management reviews the operations information of the debtor and the estimated fair value of the collateral held as security to determine whether an allowance for losses is required 
any required allowance for losses is recorded in the period of determination 
at december   and  there were no significant delinquencies  and as such  no allowance for losses have been recorded 
valuation of real estate acquired through foreclosure the value of real estate acquired through foreclosure is established at the lower of cost or fair value less disposition costs at the date of foreclosure 
cost is considered to be the aggregate of the outstanding principal and interest  past due ad valorem taxes and other fees associated with the foreclosure 
subsequent to the foreclosure date  valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the full carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at such time  a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
valuation of the real estate is based on the estimates of management and is subject to judgment 
at december   and  no valuation allowances were recorded 
gain recognition on land sales accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america dictate the manner in which the gain or loss on the sale of land is recorded 
the trust has established policies for the sale of land  which result in the full accrual method of gain recognition 
this policy generally requires that the trust receive a minimum cash down payment of of the sales price on each sale and that any related notes receivable require regular principal and interest payments  payable over terms from to years 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust s primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates related to its notes receivable 
to limit the impact of interest rate changes  the trust enters into fixed rate notes receivable that approximate the current interest rate for land sales at the time 
as a result  the trust s only interest rate risk is the opportunity loss should interest rates increase 
the following table summarizes expected maturities of the trust s notes receivable 
as the interest rates represent rates which management believes are current rates on similar land sales  the trust believes the fair values of its notes receivable approximate the carrying amounts 
year ending december maturity thereafter  the trust s remaining financial instruments consist of cash  temporary cash investments and accounts payable and other liabilities and the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments
