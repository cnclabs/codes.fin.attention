in fiscal  consolidated net sales were billion  of which our pet products segment  or pet products  accounted for million and our lawn and garden products segment  or garden products  accounted for million 
in fiscal  income from operations was million  of which pet products accounted for million and garden products accounted for million  before corporate expenses and eliminations of million 
background we transitioned our company to a leading marketer and producer of branded products from a traditional pet and lawn and garden supplies distributor 
we made this transition because we recognized the opportunity to build a portfolio of leading brands and improve profitability by capitalizing on our knowledge of the pet and lawn and garden supplies sectors  our strong relationships with retailers  and our nationwide sales and logistics network 
our goal was to diversify our business and improve operating margins by establishing a portfolio of leading brands 
since  we have acquired numerous branded products companies and product lines  including wellmark and four paws in fiscal  kaytee products  tfh and pennington seed in fiscal  norcal pottery in fiscal  amdro and all glass aquarium in fiscal  lilly miller in fiscal  alaska fish fertilizer in fiscal and kent marine  new england pottery  interpet  krb seed company  dba budd s seed  and energy savers unlimited in fiscal while expanding our branded products business  we experienced adverse events in our distribution business 
from to  we were the master distributor of round up and ortho 
in january  the scotts company  one of our largest distribution suppliers at the time  acquired ortho and became the marketing agent for round up 
in july  scotts terminated its relationship with us 
subsequently  we downsized our distribution operations and integrated these sales and logistics networks into our pet and lawn and garden products businesses to allow us to focus resources and provide strategic sales support for our brands 
virtually all of our sales before fiscal were from distributing other manufacturers products 
since then  our branded product sales have grown to approximately million  or approximately of total sales  in fiscal during this same period  our sales of other manufacturers products have declined to approximately of total sales  and our gross profit margins have improved from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents recent developments we completed six acquisitions during the fiscal year ended september  pro forma results of operations have not been presented for any of the acquisitions because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to central s operating results either individually  or in the aggregate 
the consolidated financial statements include the effects of these acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition 
these acquisitions are summarized as follows consideration paid including transaction costs net tangible assets acquired other intangible assets acquired goodwill in the aggregate  these acquisitions contributed million in revenue in fiscal and million in operating income 
each acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations interest expense  net other income income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal this was due primarily to a million  or  increase in our branded product sales of which million related to our fiscal acquisitions and million related to organic sales growth 
sales of our own branded products represented of our total sales in fiscal garden products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  our garden branded product sales increased to million from million in fiscal  and sales of other manufacturers products increased to million from million in fiscal the increased sales of our garden branded products were due primarily to million of sales from our fiscal acquisitions of new england pottery and budd seed  partially offset by a decline in grass seed sales of approximately million due to unseasonable weather conditions impacting demand at the retail level and a strong comparable in fiscal 
table of contents pet products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal pet branded product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and sales of other manufacturers products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased sales of our pet branded products were due primarily to million of sales from our fiscal acquisitions of kent marine  interpet and esu and increased organic sales of million related to aquarium and insect control products 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pet products gross profit increased million  or and garden products gross profit increased million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting increases from to in pet products and from to in garden products 
these gross profit increases were due primarily to the million contribution from fiscal acquisitions and the restoration of wild bird feed product margins  which increased million  to more normal levels and a shift in product mix to higher margin products 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities since some entities include all of their distribution costs in cost of goods sold and others exclude a portion of them from gross margin and include them in an operating expense line item below the gross profit line 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased selling and administrative cost elements 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during fiscal to during fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to million from fiscal acquisitions and the fiscal organic sales increase  which led to increased selling and delivery expenses 
selling and delivery expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal driven primarily by increased fuel and freight costs 
facilities expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to million from our fiscal acquisitions and million in shutdown costs of a pet manufacturing facility 
warehouse and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal garden products increased million  pet products increased million and corporate increased million 
the increase was due primarily to million from our fiscal acquisitions  a million increase in salaries and wages and million in professional fees incurred for unsuccessful acquisitions 
other income other income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal earnings from equity method investments decreased due primarily to an underperforming investment in a distribution company  partially offset by earnings from an investment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense net interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to million of fees and expenses incurred in fiscal 
table of contents associated with the early retirement of our convertible subordinated notes in january and the refinancing of our senior credit facility in may the impact of the increase in total long term debt during fiscal was offset by a slightly lower effective interest rate due to converting million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes to a floating rate 
average borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased borrowings to finance acquisitions during fiscal the average interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal our fiscal combined federal and state statutory tax rate was approximately as compared to in fiscal the difference between the combined statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate in fiscal was due to utilization of state income tax credits and the impact of non us tax rates at our uk based subsidiary 
in fiscal the difference was due primarily to utilization of state income tax credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal this was due primarily to a million  or  increase in our branded product sales 
all branded product sales growth was organic 
sales of our own branded products represented of our total sales in fiscal garden products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  our garden branded product sales increased to million from million in fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in the sales of other manufacturers products in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the largest factors contributing to the sales increase of our garden branded products were increased sales of our grass seed of approximately million  wild bird food of approximately million and ant control products of approximately million 
pet products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal pet branded product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and sales of other manufacturers products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased sales of our pet branded products were due primarily to increased sales of our insect control products of approximately million  including pre strike  our new consumer mosquito control product  increased bird food sales of approximately million  and increased aquarium sales of approximately million 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pet products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased gross profit from sales of our own branded products and increased margin for other manufacturers products 
garden products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased sales of our own branded products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting decreases from to in pet products and from to in garden products 
the decline in gross margin was due primarily to the impact of higher than normal grain prices caused by the drought in the plains states  partially offset by increased sales of our higher margin branded products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreased administrative costs  partially offset by increased selling and delivery expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased sales and higher advertising expenses 
selling and delivery expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal advertising expenses included an aggressive advertising campaign for the launch of pre strike and a significantly increased consumer advertising campaign for our fire ant bait brand 
facilities expenses decreased million from million in fiscal to million in the decrease was shared by both pet products and garden products due to the decreased number of sales and logistics centers and shutdown costs that were absorbed in fiscal warehouse and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal garden products decreased million  pet products decreased million and corporate decreased million 
the decreases were due primarily to a million reduction in legal and litigation expenses and million in reduced costs due to the impact of facility closures in fiscal additionally  increased sales and inventory levels in fiscal reduced the amount of purchasing  merchandise  handling and storage costs charged to warehouse and administration expense and instead included as inventory costs 
these decreases were offset partially by increased health care and workers compensation insurance expenses 
other income other income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to million of life insurance proceeds  partially offset by a million write off of goodwill associated with an unsuccessful equity method investment  recorded in fiscal earnings from equity method investments were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal interest expense net interest expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million represented fees and expenses associated with the early retirement of our convertible subordinated notes in january and the refinancing of our senior credit facility in may the remainder of the increase was due primarily to higher interest expense associated with the issuance in january of our million percent senior subordinated notes due average borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the average interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal  before the cumulative effect of accounting change 
our combined federal and state statutory tax rate is approximately 
the difference between the combined statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to utilization of state income tax credits and in fiscal was due primarily to non taxable insurance proceeds 

table of contents inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial 
weather and seasonality historically  our sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve 
additionally  garden products business has historically been highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products net sales and of our total net sales occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income is typically generated in this period  which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of equity and debt securities to the public 
historically  our lawn and garden business has been seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources tracked closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter  accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
as a result of the reduction in sales of garden products manufactured by other parties as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern has become somewhat less significant 
we service two broad markets pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies 
our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with very little change quarter to quarter 
as a result  it is not necessary to carry large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands 
additionally  this level sales cycle eliminates the need for manufacturers to give extended credit terms to either distributors or retailers 
on the other hand  our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately of garden products aggregate sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters 
for many manufacturers of garden products  this seasonality requires them to move large quantities of their product well ahead of the peak selling periods 
to encourage distributors to carry large amounts of inventory  industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and or promotional discounts 
cash provided by operating activities increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased income and decreased inventory levels  partially offset by decreased prepaid income taxes that increased operating cash in fiscal decreased inventory levels were due primarily to managed efforts to decrease grass seed inventories in response to the decrease in grass seed sales in fiscal net cash used in investing activities increased million due primarily to million of cash paid for fiscal acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million due to the million of net proceeds borrowed on our million line of credit 
in january  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due 
table of contents in may  we closed a million senior secured credit facility consisting of a five year million revolving credit facility and a six year million term loan 
in march  we amended the facility to increase the maximum amount available under the revolving credit portion by million to million and to include the option to borrow in euros  canadian dollars and pounds sterling 
interest on the term loan is based on a rate equal to libor or the prime rate plus  at our option 
interest on the revolving credit facility is based on a rate equal to prime plus a margin  which fluctuates from to or libor plus a margin which fluctuates from to  determined quarterly based on consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the most recent trailing month period 
this facility is secured by essentially all of our assets  contains certain financial covenants requiring maintenance of minimum levels of interest coverage and maximum levels of senior debt to ebitda and total debt to ebitda  and restricts our ability to make treasury stock purchases 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of september  this facility also requires the lenders prior written consent to any material investments in or acquisitions of a business 
the balance outstanding at september  under the million revolving credit facility was million  and the remaining available borrowing capacity was million  with million outstanding under certain letters of credit 
in october  we entered into a million pay floating interest rate swap effectively converting half of our million fixed rate senior subordinated notes to a floating rate of libor 
in october  we deposited approximately million into an escrow account in connection with an appeal in the scotts litigation 
the use of this cash is restricted from general corporate purposes 
see item legal proceedings scotts litigation 
at september   our total debt was million versus million at september  net debt  or total debt less cash and cash equivalents  increased to million at september  versus million at september  primarily as a result of acquisitions in fiscal fiscal year ended september  september  in thousands current portion of long term debt long term debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt the table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to us and their associated expiration dates in millions maximum commercial commitments less than year years years total amount committed revolving line of credit facility the table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year in millions 
contractual obligations fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total revolving line of credit facility long term debt operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we believe that cash flows from operating activities  funds available under our credit facility and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
as part of our growth strategy  we have engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past and anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  we may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which generally would require share based payments to employees be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our statements of operations 
although some of the technical issues that will play a significant role in determining the fair value and accounting for employee stock options have not been finalized  the effective date for the proposed standard is for quarterly periods beginning after june  the proposed statement  once finalized  is expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the pro forma impact on our consolidated result of operations within our footnotes 
this will result in lower reported earnings and earnings per share 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are required for  but are not limited to  accounts receivable and inventory realizable values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred and current income taxes  self insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
although not all inclusive  we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies  which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for credit losses and disputed balances resulting from customers inability to make required payments 
we estimate our allowance based on both specific identification and historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  or we were not able to demonstrate the validity of amounts due  additional allowances may be required 
for more information  see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory inventory  which primarily consists of lawn and garden products and pet supplies finished goods  is stated at the lower of first in first out fifo cost or market 
cost includes certain indirect purchasing  merchandise handling and storage costs including certain salary and data processing costs incurred to acquire or manufacture inventory  costs to unload  process and put away shipments received to prepare them to be picked for orders  and certain overhead costs 
we compute the amount of such costs capitalized to inventory based on an estimate of costs related to the procurement and processing of inventory to prepare it for sale compared to total product purchases 
when necessary  we have reduced the carrying value of our inventory if market conditions indicate that we will not recover the carrying cost upon sale 
future downward changes in market conditions related to our products would result in an additional charge to income in the period in which such conditions occur 
goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a pre tax million non cash impairment of our goodwill as of september   which was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of our fourth quarter 
we use projected future operating results and cash flows of our reporting units to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of the associated goodwill 
if estimated future results of operations differed from those projections used by management  or if alternative valuation methodologies had been used in determining the reporting units fair value  the cumulative effect of accounting change charge may have been different than the amount we recorded 
future downward changes in the operating results of our reporting units may result in additional charges to income in the year which such conditions occur 
as of june  and june   we performed our annual goodwill impairment analyses 
based on the results of those analyses  no additional reduction of goodwill was required during fiscal years or long lived assets we review our long lived assets for potential impairment based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
long lived assets are included in impairment evaluations when events and circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of impairment losses for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the estimated fair value of the assets 
we have recorded asset impairment charges when the carrying value of an asset was in excess of its fair value 
should market conditions or the assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of assets change  or management change plans for usage of certain assets  additional charges to operations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and have provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method provided for under sfas no 
had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
as required under sfas no 
 the pro forma effects of stock based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
for purposes of our pro forma disclosures which are included in note of our consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized over the options vesting period 
although different valuation methodologies are available  we have chosen the intrinsic value method to account for common stock incentive awards 
this accounting policy has been applied consistently for all years 
table of contents presented 
operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on operating results of using apb opinion is included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb has announced its intention to soon require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options 
the fasb s review of technical issues will play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options 
in the future  should we expense the value of employee stock options  we will recognize more compensation expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes result primarily from bad debt allowances  inventory write downs  depreciation and nondeductible reserves 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  any adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
for more information  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for self insurance we maintain insurance for certain risks  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  and are self insured for employee related health care benefits 
our workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability insurance policies include deductibles of  to  per occurrence 
we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health care costs in excess of  per person per year 
we establish reserves for losses based on our claims experience and industry actuarial estimates of the ultimate loss amount inherent in the claims  including losses for claims incurred but not reported 
any differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals 
commitments and contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several significant legal matters as well as other matters incidental to our business  the disposition of which are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we use our best estimates to determine the probable outcome and costs associated with the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of potential litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by adverse developments or changes in management s strategy related to these proceedings 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material at the present time or are not presently known to us 
conditions could change in the future  or new information may come to our attention that could impact our assessment of these risks 
if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition and or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will 
table of contents have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
we may be adversely affected by trends in the retail industry 
with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space  price demands and other conditions 
in addition  as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels  there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a just in time basis 
this requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand  which could in the future require the carrying of additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirement 
a significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales  profitability and cash flow 
we continually monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate 
despite these efforts  a bankruptcy filing by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition in the future 
we depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our business 
wal mart  our largest customer  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in addition  although each accounted for less than of our net sales  home depot  lowe s  petsmart and petco are also significant customers and  together with wal mart  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the market shares of all of these key retailers have increased during the last several years and may continue to increase in future years 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  our relationship with any of these key retailers could cause our net sales  income from operations and cash flow to decline 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations and cash flow 
we cannot be certain that our product innovations and marketing successes will continue 
we believe that our past performance has been based upon  and our future success will depend upon  in part  our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop  market and produce new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and production of any new products or product innovations  or develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
seeds and grains we use to produce bird food and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that has had  and could have  a negative impact on us 
our financial results depend to some extent on the cost of raw materials and our ability to pass along increases in these costs to our customers 
in particular  our pennington and kaytee subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodity seeds and grains used to produce bird food 
historically  market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in 
table of contents united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
for example  due to drought conditions in  we experienced significant increases in the costs of most grains and seeds purchased for production 
these cost increases had a negative impact on profitability of bird food products in fiscal in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  we would be required to increase sales prices to avoid margin deterioration 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or extent of our ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by us may affect the volumes of future shipments 
a portion of our grass seed operations are subject to crop yield and commodity pricing 
in fiscal and  garden products was adversely affected by a worldwide oversupply of certain grass seeds brought on by a combination of weather issues and the bankruptcy sale of a competitor  generally poor economic conditions in agriculture  and cattle diseases that reduced demand for seed 
by close of fiscal  the grass seed market returned to more normal conditions with overall supply demand balance  yet certain varieties were in oversupply  and others were in short supply 
in  we experienced unusually wet weather in portions of the united states  adversely impacting sales and crop harvests of non proprietary seeds 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in market prices  we enter into purchase contracts for grains  bird food and grass seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since these contracts cover only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
in contrast  if market prices for grains decrease because of a lack of demand  we may end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market 
competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy  achieve profitability  or maintain relationships with existing customers 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
we compete against numerous other companies  some of which are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do 
our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers 
our largest competitors in pet supplies products are hartz mountain and united pet group  and our largest competitor in lawn and garden products is the scotts company 
since its acquisition of the ortho line of lawn and garden products from pharmacia corporation formerly monsanto in  scotts dominant position in the lawn and garden industry has been a significant competitive disadvantage for garden products 
to compete effectively  among other things  we must maintain our relationships with key retailers  continually develop innovative new products that appeal to consumers  maintain strict quality standards  deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices  and effectively integrate acquired companies 
competition could cause lower sales volumes  price reductions  reduced profits or losses  or loss of market share 
our inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks 
we have completed numerous acquisitions since and intend to grow through the acquisition of additional companies 
we are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  may 
table of contents become available in the near future 
if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available  we intend to pursue them actively 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  additional financing  if necessary and available  could increase leverage  dilute equity  or both  the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles  and the high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
in fiscal  we took a pre tax write off million relating to goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas in fiscal  we completed six acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  acquire  or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial difficulties 
in future acquisitions  we also could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our lawn and garden sales are highly seasonal and subject to adverse weather  either of which could impact our cash flow and operating results 
because our lawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer  garden products business is seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products net sales and of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income and cash flow is generated in this period 
our working capital needs and our borrowings generally peak near the middle of our second fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenses in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet our seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay our borrowings on a timely basis  this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  our results of operations and cash flow could also be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations and cash flow were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the united states 
our operating results and cash flow are susceptible to fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales  net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis 
factors that may contribute to this variability include weather conditions during peak gardening seasons and seasonality  shifts in demand for lawn and garden products  shifts in demand for pet products  
table of contents changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  the effect of acquisitions  including the costs of acquisitions that are not completed  and economic stability of retail customers 
these fluctuations could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock 
our success is dependent upon retaining key personnel 
our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of william e 
brown  our chairman  glenn w 
novotny  our president and chief executive officer  and brooks m 
pennington iii  the president of our pennington subsidiary 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
some of the products that we manufacture and distribute require governmental permits and also subject us to potential environmental liabilities 
many of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations are often complex and are subject to change 
environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal 
regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations 
although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and have internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products  there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations 
however  neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury  property damages or governmental enforcement 
in addition  while we do not anticipate having to make  and historically have not had to make  significant capital expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology  we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital expenditures will not be required 
in addition to operational standards  environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
accordingly  we may become liable  either contractually or by operation of law  for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us  or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property 
with our extensive acquisition history  we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities 
given the nature of the past operations conducted by us and others at these properties  there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified  even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted 
while we are not subject to any existing remediation obligations  future events  such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement  or the discovery of currently unknown contamination  may give rise to future remediation liabilities that may be material 
see item legal proceedings  phoenix fire 
the products that we manufacture could expose us to product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products 
although we generally seek to insure against such risks  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 

table of contents we have pending litigation which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are a party to certain legal proceedings  including the litigation between us and scotts  us and herbert axelrod and litigation arising from a fire which destroyed our phoenix  arizona facility 
we are currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of our legal proceedings 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of our legal proceedings  they could result in significant diversion of time by our management 
the results of our pending legal proceedings  including any potential settlements  are uncertain and we cannot assure you that the outcome of these disputes will not adversely affect our operating results or future cashflows 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and may sustain a loss of public confidence  if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor attest to such evaluation 
this evaluation will be required in our form k for the fiscal year ending september  during the next year  we will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements 
as a result  we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time 
while we currently anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission or the nasdaq stock market 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and could cause our stock price to fall 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
we have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb  and  accordingly  we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in march  the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which generally would require share based payments to employees be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our statements of operations 
the effective date for the proposed standard is for quarterly periods beginning after june  this proposed statement is expected to be finalized  and would have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the impact on our consolidated result of operations within our footnotes 
this will result in lower reported earnings and earnings per share which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  should the proposal be finalized  this could impact our ability to utilize broad based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
the holders of our class b stock  through their voting power  can greatly influence control of central 
as of december   william e 
brown  our chairman  controlled approximately of the voting power of our capital stock 
accordingly  he can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval  
table of contents including the power to elect all of our directors 
holders of class b stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or of the total votes cast 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned 
the holders of class b stock have of the combined voting power  subject to the aforementioned voting restrictions 
holders of class b stock are likely to be able to elect all of our directors  control our management and policies and determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law 
the disproportionate voting rights of our common stock and class b stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders 
accordingly  such disproportionate voting rights may deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices  since takeover bids frequently involve purchases of stock directly from stockholders at such a premium price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on our credit facility and million of our senior subordinated notes is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt had changed by compared to actual rates  interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
commodity prices 
we are exposed to fluctuation in market prices for grains and grass seed 
to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability  we enter into contracts for grains  bird food and grass seed purchases 
such contracts are primarily entered into to ensure commodity availability to us in the future 
as of september   we had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  as of september   we had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  foreign currency risks 
our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
to date  we have had minimal sales outside of the united states 
purchases made by our us subsidiaries from foreign vendors are primarily made in us dollars 
our international subsidiary transacts most of its business in british pounds 
therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial to our current business
