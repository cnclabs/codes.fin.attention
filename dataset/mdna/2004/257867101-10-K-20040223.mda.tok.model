commercial printing remains a competitive industry 
consolidation among our customers and in the printing industry  as well as over capacity in the industry as a whole  has put pressure on prices and increased competition among printers 
we compete by leveraging our position and size  generating continued productivity improvements and enhancing the value we deliver to our customers by offering them products and services that improve their effectiveness and reduce their total delivered cost 
while we have contracts with many of our print customers as discussed below  there are many competing companies and renewal of these contracts is dependent  in part  on our ability to continue to differentiate ourself from the competition 
while our manufacturing and distribution facilities are well located for the global  national or regional distribution of our products  competitors in some areas of the us may have a competitive advantage in some instances due to such factors as freight rates  wage scales and customer preference for local services 
in addition to location  other important competitive factors are price and quality  as well as the range of available services 

table of contents demand in several of the end markets served by print and logistics is affected by advertising and consumer spending trends 
historically  our businesses which serve the magazines  catalogs and retail and book end markets generate higher revenues in the second half of the year  driven by increased advertising pages within magazines  and holiday catalog  retail and book volumes 
these same factors drive higher revenues in the second half of the year for both our print and package logistics businesses 
approximately of our total company sales are under term contracts with customers  with the remainder on a single order basis 
for some customers  we print and provide related services for different publications under different contracts 
contracts with our larger customers normally run for a period of years usually three to five years  but longer in the case of contracts requiring significant capital investment or for an indefinite period subject to termination on specified notice by either party 
these sales contracts generally provide for price adjustments to reflect price changes for materials  wages and utilities 
no single customer had a relationship with the company that accounted for or more of our sales in the primary raw materials we use in our print businesses are paper and ink 
in  we spent approximately billion on raw materials 
we are a large purchaser of paper and our focus is to improve materials performance and total cost management for our customers  which we believe is a competitive advantage 
we negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies  but we do not rely on any one supplier 
we have existing paper supply contracts at prevailing market prices to cover substantially all of our requirements through and management believes extensions and renewals of these purchase contracts will provide adequate paper supplies in the future 
ink and related materials are currently available in sufficient amounts  and we believe that we will have adequate supplies in the future 
we also coordinate purchasing activity at the local facility and corporate levels to increase economies of scale 
our logistics segment is a large purchaser of transportation services 
while there are currently sufficient sources of these services  the cost of such services has been affected by fuel prices as well as by changes in government regulations 
we continually work to leverage the volume we give third party transportation companies in order to minimize transportation costs 
our overriding objectives in the environmental  health and safety areas are to create sustainable compliance and an injury free workplace 
we believe that estimated capital expenditures for environmental controls to comply with federal  state and local provisions  as well as expenditures  if any  for our share of costs to clean hazardous waste sites that have received our waste  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or our competitive position 
as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees in our us workforce have been our employees for to years  and more than  have been our employees for years or longer 
as of december   we employed approximately  people in the us  approximately  or  of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in addition  we employed approximately  people in our international operations  approximately  or  of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
on november   we entered into a combination agreement with moore wallace incorporated moore wallace  a leading provider of print management and outsourced communications 
based on the terms of the agreement  a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of rr donnelley will acquire each of the outstanding common shares of moore wallace for of a share of common stock of rr donnelley 
we expect that  upon closing of the transaction  we will issue approximately million shares of rr donnelley common stock  as well as undertake the obligation for the indebtedness of moore wallace which was approximately million as of december  the transaction was approved by the boards of directors of both rr donnelley and moore wallace  but remains subject to certain closing conditions that include  among others  the receipt of required approval from both companies shareholders and ontario superior court of justice approval of a plan of arrangement 
the transaction is expected to close on february  see related discussion under 
table of contents expected impact of combination with moore wallace incorporated under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on march   we acquired certain net assets of momentum logistics  inc mli  a florida based provider of package distribution services  for approximately million in cash 
mli operates sortation facilities and a dedicated fleet of vehicles to provide package distribution services 
the purchase price has been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and resulted in million of goodwill 
subsequently  we recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill as a result of our annual impairment review performed under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we did not make any business acquisitions during or in december  we sold our investment in multimedia live to an unrelated third party purchaser for million in cash 
in july  we sold our equity investment in global directory services company to an unrelated third party purchaser for million in cash 
in november  we sold our remaining investment in the common stock of stream international inc stream for million in cash 
see note  divestitures  and note  acquisitions and investments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during  and  we announced the closure of several of our facilities within the print segment  financial segment and international operations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our overall print platform

management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the overall loss  if any  that could result from an unfavorable final determination of this matter 
we have been designated as a potentially responsible party in federal and state superfund sites 
in addition to the superfund sites  we may also have the obligation to remediate five other previously owned facilities  our share of these remediation costs is estimated to be less than million 
we have established reserves that are believed to be adequate to cover our share of the potential costs of remediating each of the superfund sites and the previously owned facilities 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable and are based on the latest available information  the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information about the extent of the remediation required becomes available 
at the superfund sites  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act provides that our liability could be joint and several  meaning that we could be required to pay an amount in excess of our proportionate share of the remediation costs 
our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the superfund sites and of other liable parties at the previously owned facilities has been considered  where appropriate  in the determination of our estimated liability 
management believes that any superfund costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the superfund sites or as a liable party at the previously owned facilities will not be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization under us bankruptcy laws

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part iv of this form k 
overview we operate principally in the commercial print portion of the print industry  with related service offerings designed to offer customers complete solutions for communicating their messages to targeted audiences 
the dominant macro economic and industry wide trend for the past three years has been weaker demand during a slow economy that has generated excess industry capacity resulting in increased competition and downward pricing pressures 
in this intensified competitive pricing environment  companies have focused on reducing costs in order to preserve operating margins 
we believe this environment has led to more consolidation within the commercial print industry as companies seek economies of scale  broader customer relationships  geographic coverage and product breadth to overcome offset industry over capacity and pricing pressures 
beginning january   we revised our segment reporting to reflect financial as a separate segment 
our financial operations were previously reported within the other segment 
as a result of these changes  we disclose three reportable segments print  logistics and financial 
the primary drivers affecting our business differ by segment 
in our print segment  consumer confidence and economic growth rates are key drivers of demand for commercial print  as these factors affect the level of advertising and merchandising activity 
while general economic trends have recently begun to improve  we have not yet begun to see the positive effects of an economic recovery within our print segment 
historical trends indicate that magazine advertising pages  a key indicator of demand for printing products and services  recover more slowly after a recession than other sectors of the economy 
our financial segment s results are driven by the level of deal activity in the capital markets  as well as regulatory compliance requirements and our ability to capture market share 
during the second half of  we benefited from increased capital markets activity following a three year period of economic slowdown  as well as from our ability to gain market share through our focus on customer service 
continued increases in capital markets activity are likely to positively affect demand for services within our financial segment 
however  volatility in the global capital markets makes it difficult to predict the future level of demand 
our logistics segment serves our customers by consolidating and delivering printed products print logistics and packages package logistics to the us postal service closer to the final destination  resulting in reduced postage costs and improved delivery performance 
as postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures  our logistics segment is focused on providing services that enhance value to customers by improving the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution 
our print logistics business is subject to many of the same macro economic drivers as our print businesses 
however  we have partially overcome negative market demand trends of recent years by growing our volume with products printed by other printers  but delivered by us third party volume  due to our scale and performance levels 
print logistics is profitable and strategically important to our print customers 
during  operating results of our package logistics business were negatively impacted by start up problems at a new consolidation facility  as well as operational issues from a recent acquisition 
in addition  we identified weaknesses in our transactional processing systems for packages as we increased our scale of operations and entered into more complex customer and carrier arrangements 
our ability to improve the profitability of our package operations is contingent upon our ability to fully address these operational and transactional processing issues as discussed on pages and  as well as to sustain and grow our customer base 

table of contents in response to the above trends  we have regularly assessed our manufacturing platforms and logistics network to assure that they are efficient  flexible and aligned with customer needs 
to meet this objective  we have closed several facilities that lacked the necessary scale and geographic location to remain competitive  and invested in expansions of other more scaleable operations 
in addition  we have continued to execute other cost reduction initiatives across all of our operations 
we have also implemented strategic initiatives  including productivity programs such as six sigma and process variability reduction  as well as business process redesign  which have positively impacted our financial results and helped to mitigate the effects of price erosion 
likewise  we have focused on creating new revenue opportunities for value added services such as premedia and logistics 
as a result  we have created a broader platform to sell more products and services as well as improve incremental revenue and profit growth within our current customer base 
in november  we announced that we had entered into a definitive combination agreement the combination with moore wallace incorporated moore wallace 
the transaction is anticipated to bring together two print industry leaders with highly complementary products and services to create the world s premier full service global provider and the largest printing company in north america 
the strategy for the combined company will focus on improved returns  lower costs and increased profitability  increased financial strength  and enhanced revenue opportunities 
while the detailed plans have not yet been finalized  management believes that the combination will impact operating results in future periods through improved cross selling efforts by providing a total management solution  leveraging product and distribution strengths  aggressive cost reduction efforts  including headcount and facility rationalization  and increased purchasing power with suppliers to reduce costs and increase efficiencies 
unless indicated otherwise  the discussion and financial results disclosed in this annual report on form k relate to rr donnelley as a stand alone entity  and do not reflect the impact of the pending combination with moore wallace incorporated 
see expected impact of combination with moore wallace incorporated for further discussion of the transaction 
significant accounting policies and critical estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize print revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete 
approximately of our business is under contract 
contracts typically specify fob shipping point terms 
we generally recognize revenue upon final shipment for a print job and not on a partial shipment basis 
for most print jobs  it is common for customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities up to and including at the time of shipment 
our products are not shipped subject to any contractual right of return provisions 
absent specific contract terms  we recognize revenue upon final delivery of the product or upon completion of the service performed 
within our financial segment  which serves the global financial services end market  we produce highly customized materials such as regulatory s filings  initial public offerings and mutual fund compliance 
table of contents communications  as well as provide edgar related services 
revenue is recognized for these customers following final delivery of the printed product or upon completion of the service performed 
revenues related to our premedia operations  which include digital content management such as photography  color services and page production  are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract  typically upon completion of the performed service and acceptance by the customer 
with respect to logistics  whose operations include the delivery of packages and printed material  we recognize revenue upon completion of the delivery services we provide 
accounting for goodwill and certain other intangibles in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and are required to assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at a minimum annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for impairment  and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to environmental  employment and other matters  as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of certain legal proceedings 
long lived assets we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell 
our long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets primarily the costs of acquiring print contracts and volume guarantees that are amortized to net sales over the periods in which benefits will be realized 
investments in affordable housing  which are included in other noncurrent assets  are recorded at cost  as adjusted for our share of any declines in the fair value of the underlying properties that are deemed to be other than temporary 
our basis for determining fair value of the underlying properties requires applying management s judgment using a significant number of estimates 
we derive our estimates of fair value using remaining future tax credits to be received and expected residual values upon sale or disposition of our ownership interests 
expected residual values are developed from industry assumptions and cash flow projections provided by the underlying partnerships and include certain assumptions with respect to operating costs  debt 
table of contents levels and certain market data related to the properties such as assumed vacancy rates 
should these assumptions differ from actual results in the future  we may be required to further write down our carrying value of these investments 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  acquisitions and investments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we have recorded deferred tax assets related to domestic and foreign tax loss carryforwards 
limitations on the utilization of these tax assets may apply  accordingly  we have provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets as we have concluded that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  adjustments to the valuation allowance may need to be recorded 
it is the company s policy to not record a tax benefit for net operating losses in countries with a limited net operating loss carry forward period 
additionally  no provision has been recorded on unremitted earnings which are considered to be indefinitely invested in non us subsidiaries 
defined benefit retirement plans we present the status of our defined benefit obligations and related plan assets in note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and annual pension and postretirement benefit income are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions 
key assumptions include the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
we determine the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual income or expense as of the beginning of the year using a measurement date of september  based on an index of high quality corporate bond yields as of that date 
the weighted average discount rates assumed for determining annual pension and postretirement income expense in were and  respectively 
we expect to lower the discount rates for purposes of determining both pension and postretirement income expense to in due to a decline in high quality corporate bond yields as of september  we determine the estimated return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our respective plan allocations 
the weighted average expected asset return for our pension plans as of the end of was 
plan assets for our pension plans are generally allocated as follows domestic equity  non us equity and fixed income securities 
by assuming historic returns of for equity and for fixed income securities as a benchmark  the weighted average expected return based on our pension plan asset allocation would be compared with our assumed rate of 
while we have assumed no change in targeted asset allocation percentages for  we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to based on declines in equity market performance  primarily over the last three years  versus long term historical averages 
the weighted average expected asset return for our postretirement benefit plans as of the end of was 
plan assets for our postretirement benefit plans are generally allocated as follows domestic equity  non us equity and fixed income securities 
by assuming historic returns of for equity and 
table of contents for fixed income securities  the weighted average expected return based on our postretirement benefit plan allocation would be  compared with our assumed rate of 
while we have assumed no change in asset allocation percentages for  we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to based on declines in equity market performance  primarily over the last three years  versus long term historical averages 
as a result of the expected assumption changes for as noted above  we anticipate pension and postretirement income to be reduced by approximately million in we expect to make approximately million in cash contributions to our pension plans during other matters other than non cancelable operating lease commitments  we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned subsidiaries 
minority interests in the income or loss of consolidated subsidiaries are included in other income expense in the consolidated income statement 
intercompany items and transactions are eliminated in consolidation

table of contents net sales for our print segment decreased million in  or  from net sales for magazines  catalogs and retail decreased million  or  between years  primarily reflecting price deterioration and a mix shift to work with a lower price per unit  partially offset by higher volume 
the economic slowdown that began in generated excess industry capacity from reduced demand levels and higher customer bankruptcies resulting in increased competition and pricing pressures 
lower contract prices on renewals have continued to cycle through our results 
the net sales decline of in premedia was driven by these same factors 
net sales of our book business were down million  or  between years  due to lower volumes including fewer reprint orders  lower average prices and a less favorable mix of more soft cover books with a lower price per unit and fewer case bound books 
net sales for telecommunications were down million  or  between years  primarily due to more customer furnished paper and lower average prices  partially offset by higher volume 
value added revenue for our print segment decreased million  or  from  primarily due to the net sales declines noted above  partially offset by improved material yield which lowered material costs 
value added revenue for telecommunications increased between years because of higher volume  as noted above  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates on uk directory work that more than offset price declines 
this occurred despite a decrease in net sales because the portion of the decline in net sales due to more customer furnished paper had no significant impact on value added revenue

net sales for package logistics excluding mli were up for due to higher volumes and postal rate increases which were passed through to customers  partially offset by a mix change toward lighter weight  lower priced packages 
net sales of print logistics were up for  driven by higher volumes from both our print segment and from third parties for which we do not provide printing services 
value added revenue for our logistics segment increased million  or  between years  of which million related to the acquisition of mli 
excluding the acquisition of mli  value added revenue for our package logistics business was flat between years  despite a increase in net sales 
in addition to the factors affecting net sales noted above  value added revenue of our package logistics business was negatively impacted 
table of contents in by higher transportation costs  partially offset by higher postage discounts due to deeper penetration of the postal system 
higher transportation costs between years were driven by transportation rate increases and higher fuel costs 
in addition  higher costs in resulted from start up problems at a consolidation facility in the northeast  which led to the re routing of packages to other company facilities 
these start up problems were not fully resolved by the fourth quarter of  which is the peak time for package delivery 
the company has taken actions to address these start up problems  and expects to see significant improvements in operational efficiencies at this facility beginning in early value added revenue for our print logistics business increased between years  driven by higher net sales  partially offset by higher per unit transportation costs 
excluding the impact of the mli acquisition  the percentage of value added revenue to net sales for our logistics segment was in  down from in mli had a significantly higher value added revenue to net sales percentage in unlike the rest of our logistics segment  mli owns and operates a dedicated fleet of vehicles to provide package distribution services 
mli s value added revenue was a higher percentage of its net sales because these internal operating and distribution costs are included in total cost of sales rather than cost of transportation which consists of third party freight costs 
in  our logistics segment incurred a loss from operations of million  compared with earnings from operations of million in the loss from operations in included a million loss from mli since its acquisition date of march the mli loss included a pretax impairment charge of million to write down goodwill  as the estimated future cash flows for this business were not expected to be sufficient to fully recover its carrying value

petersburg and south daytona  florida  des moines  iowa  old saybrook  connecticut  and print production only at a financial segment s sales center in houston  texas

all continuing customer work produced at these facilities was transferred to other company facilities once necessary expansions to accommodate the new work were complete 
the south daytona  florida  facility was sold in the third quarter of in addition to the five us manufacturing facilities  we closed two additional facilities in outside of the us due to sales shortfalls from acquisition plans and to streamline costs ediciones eclipse sa de sa eclipse in mexico and hamburg gr fica editora hamburg in brazil 
eclipse was sold in the fourth quarter of and hamburg was sold in the second quarter of during  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million to adjust the carrying values of certain of our businesses to fair value

the write downs were primarily the result of the deterioration in net sales from the original acquisition plans  such that the carrying values of the entities were not considered to be recoverable

the approximate breakdown of these cost savings by segment was as follows print million  financial million and other million 
based on the timing of restructuring and impairment charges recorded in  we expect to recognize an additional million in savings in consisting primarily of lower salary expense and employee benefit related expenses 
the net book value of assets held for disposal at december  was million 
the above reductions in our cost structure for were offset by the impact of price deterioration and a mix shift to work with a lower price per unit during the year 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources because of our scale  manufacturing experience and strong customer base  we continue to generate strong cash flows from our printing businesses

this includes upgrading our print platform to enable us to better serve our customers in a more cost effective  flexible and efficient manner 
further  it includes building value added services upstream toward our customers and downstream toward the consumer 
if we do not have investment opportunities that generate returns above our cost of capital  our philosophy is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase and or dividends  while maintaining our targeted capital structure 
commercial paper is our primary source of short term financing

expected impact of combination with moore wallace incorporated we expect to complete our planned combination with moore wallace on february  see note  acquisitions and investments  to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the pending transaction 
upon closing the transaction  a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of rr donnelley will acquire each of the outstanding shares of moore wallace for of a share of common stock of rr donnelley 
we expect that  upon closing of the transaction  we will issue approximately million shares of rr donnelley common stock  as well as undertake moore wallace s obligations of indebtedness  which were approximately million at december  the combination is expected to create the world s premier full service commercial printer with over billion in annual net sales and approximately  employees worldwide 
the strategy for the combined company will focus on improved returns  lower costs and increased profitability  increased financial strength  and enhanced revenue opportunities 
while detailed plans have not yet been finalized  we believe that the combination will impact operating results in future periods through improved cross selling efforts by providing a total management solution  leveraging product and distribution strengths  aggressive cost reduction efforts  including headcount and facility rationalization  and increased purchasing power with suppliers to reduce costs and increase efficiencies 
we cannot predict the effect these actions will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
we will account for the combination with moore wallace under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the us our reported financial condition and results of operations issued after the completion of the transaction will reflect moore wallace s balances and results of operations after completion of the transaction  but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of moore wallace 
the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings in the first full year of operations  excluding the impact of transaction related charges 
in addition to enhanced revenue opportunities  the combined company expects to generate cost savings of at least million on an annualized basis in the first to months after the closing 
these savings are anticipated to result from the elimination of duplicative administrative and infrastructure costs  reduction in procurement expenses and asset rationalization 
the combined company is also expected to generate substantial cash flow in the first year of consolidated operations 
the combined company expects to maintain an annual dividend  which is currently per share 
in connection with the combination  we intend to enter into a new five year  unsecured revolving credit facility of between million and billion 
we intend to use this facility for general corporate purposes  including support for issuing commercial paper and letters of credit 
this new facility is intended to replace our existing day and five year credit facilities  which mature in october and october  respectively  as well as to replace a credit facility currently maintained by moore wallace 
simultaneously with or immediately following closing of the combination  we expect to issue commercial paper  supported by the new revolving credit facility of approximately million to million 
we intend to use the proceeds of this issuance to retire a portion of moore wallace s existing debt  pay fees required to terminate certain moore wallace interest rate swaps  pay fees and expenses related to the combination and related financings  and provide funds for other general corporate purposes 

table of contents subsequent to the closing of the combination  we expect to issue additional long term debt  the proceeds of which we may use to retire a portion of moore wallace s existing debt  repay outstanding commercial paper  pay debt repayment or swap termination costs and fees  or provide funds for other general corporate purposes 
on february   we entered into two separate treasury rate lock transactions totaling million with two financial institutions in order to effectively lock in a portion of the interest rate on a portion of the expected debt issue 
if we do not complete the debt issue as expected before the rate lock transactions expire or are terminated  we may incur significant costs or expenses if interest rates on treasury securities at the time of expiry or termination are less than the contracted transaction rate 
while we expect to complete the combination as currently planned  it is subject to closing conditions 
if any of the closing conditions are not met or if the combination does not close as we currently expect  we may be required to pay additional transaction related and financing costs and fees 
under certain terms specified in the combination agreement  we may also be required to pay termination fees and transaction expenses to moore wallace of up to million 
at december   we had capitalized million of costs related to the combination that would be charged to expense if the combination were not completed 
outlook the environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions 
competition is based largely on price  quality and servicing the special needs of customers 
industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets exacerbated by recent drops in market demand 
therefore  competition is intense 
our intent is to differentiate our service offerings so that we are viewed by our customers as a partner that can help them deliver effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audience at the right time 
we are a large user of paper  supplied to us by our customers or bought by us 
the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect our financial results 
however  management currently does not foresee any disruptive conditions affecting prices or supply of paper in postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that our customers are willing to mail 
any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an effect on our financial results 
postal rates increased in january  july and july  and the company does not expect postal rate increases to occur until postal rate increases can enhance the value of our logistics segment to our customers  as we are able to improve the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution 
this ability to deliver mail on a more precise schedule and at a lower relative cost should enhance our position in the marketplace 
the cost of energy affects our operating costs in our print segment and transportation costs in our logistics segment 
in our logistics segment  increases in fuel costs can be offset by fuel surcharges passed on to customers  but continuing increases in these and other energy costs could affect our consolidated financial results 
consumer confidence and economic growth are key drivers of demand for our services 
the slowdown experienced in the us and international economies is continuing to affect demand across most of our businesses 
uncertainty in the economy has led customers across most of our end markets to indicate that they anticipate flat demand throughout in the longer term  technological changes  including the electronic distribution of documents and data and the on line distribution and hosting of media content  present both risks and opportunities for us 
many of our businesses leverage distinctive capabilities to participate in the rapid growth in electronic communications 
our goal remains to help our customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audiences at the right time 
we believe that with our competitive strengths  including our comprehensive service offerings  technology leadership  depth of management experience  customer relationships and economies of scale  we can develop the most valuable solutions for our customers  which should result in increased shareholder value
