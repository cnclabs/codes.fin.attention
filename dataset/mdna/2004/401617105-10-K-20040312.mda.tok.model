the business segments of the company are wholesale  retail and licensing operations 
management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenue and earnings from operations 
information relating to these segments is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  the company revised its segment reporting to better reflect how its three business segments retail  wholesale and licensing are managed and each segment s performance is evaluated 
the earnings from operations for each segment now include those costs that are specifically related to each segment  consisting primarily of store operations  distribution  selling and merchandising  depreciation  amortization and employee compensation directly related to that business segment 
in addition  the company is continuing to allocate design and advertising charges to the business segments based on the assessed benefit derived from the respective expenditures 
the new structure excludes from the segment results corporate overhead costs  which consist of shared costs of the organization 
these costs are presented separately and include  among others  the following corporate costs information technology  human resources  accounting and finance  executive compensation  facilities and legal 
all amounts for and have been revised to conform to the presentation 
executive summary during  guess began to see improvement in its business after a steady decline in net earnings since we have seen a continuation of the positive trends we have experienced since last spring and we are benefiting from the initiatives we have undertaken on both the operational and product sides of our business 
this improvement is demonstrated by a increase in net revenues to million in from million in the company also returned to profitability in with net earnings of million compared with a loss of million in the company has also seen significant improvement in its balance sheet with continued emphasis on reducing inventory levels and improving cash flow 
during the year  inventory was reduced by even though product sales increased by 
with strong cash management and improving operating performance  the company has also reduced total borrowings by million or during the year and has increased cash and restricted cash by million by year end 
our retail segment  including full priced retail  kids  factory outlet  canada  and e commerce  generated net sales of million during  an increase of  from million in the prior year 
this growth was driven by a comparable store sales increase of and a larger store base  which represented an increase in average square footage as compared to the comparable store sales increase reflects the improved results of both the men s and women s lines and our accessories business 
in addition to strong same store sales growth  our retail stores also increased their margins and managed expenses effectively to deliver a substantial improvement in operating results 
while the full priced retail and factory outlet stores continued to show operating performance improvements  the kids stores have struggled 
as a result  management made a decision in the fourth quarter of to exit the kids store business and took a million impairment charge to write down these assets to their net realizable value 
the company plans to close these stores in the second half of and expects to incur additional charges at that time related to lease termination costs 
these charges are expected to be less than million 
we are still experiencing challenges in our wholesale segment 
the wholesale segment revenues for decreased to million from million in however  in the fourth quarter of the company experienced a sales increase in wholesale reflecting a stabilization of the number of locations in which our product is sold  and a reduction in the amount of markdown allowances granted to our wholesale customers 
we expect our wholesale business to continue to be stable in our products were sold in doors at the end of compared with doors at the end of international wholesale revenue was about flat in compared to our licensing segment performed well with revenues of million compared to million in we had licenses at the end of as compared to at the end of licensing operating earnings increased to million from million in last year 
the company has continued to make investments to improve operating efficiencies and inventory management 
to this end  we implemented a new manufacturing system to gain further operating efficiencies through automation 
this system  along with other actions we are taking  should result in improved product visibility and lower processing and freight costs in the future 
in addition  a new inventory allocation system we are rolling out is resulting in improved inventory turnover and in stock positions in the stores  and is contributing to higher store sales volumes with less inventory 
we believe that our bottom line has started to reflect the efforts we have made to utilize our resources efficiently and ensure that our cost structure is as streamlined as possible 
this has included looking for every opportunity to eliminate unproductive activities and improve expense management in our corporate offices as well as our retail stores 
these efforts have resulted in lower s  g a expense for the year  despite an larger store base  and over basis points of improvement in our s  g a rate as a percentage of net revenues for this improvement underscores the leverage of our retail business model and its significant opportunity for further profit growth 
application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes and evaluation of net recoverable amounts and accruals for the sublet of certain lease obligations 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers  after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collections trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues  and are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these costs result from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historic trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out and weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors its off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis or when a triggering event occurs 
the assets are considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the undiscounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as such  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk the company receives united states dollars usd for the majority of all product sales and licensing revenue 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in usd  however  purchase prices for products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the usd and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of goods in the future 
in addition  royalties received from international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to the company in usd
