overview historical background 
we originally incorporated as caldera systems  inc  a utah corporation caldera systems  on august   and reincorporated as a delaware corporation on march  in march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
on may   we formed a new holding company in delaware under the name of caldera international  inc to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups of the santa cruz operation  now known as tarantella  inc 
in connection with this acquisition  caldera systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of caldera international  inc former holders of shares and options to purchase shares of caldera systems received an equal number of shares and options to purchase shares in caldera international  inc our operating results for fiscal year include the results of caldera systems for the period of november through may and include the results of caldera international which included the acquired operations of the server and professional services groups from the santa cruz operation from may through october on may   our stockholders approved our corporate name change to the sco group  inc recent developments 
during fiscal year  we launched our scosource intellectual property initiatives and brought a lawsuit against ibm 
we disclose our lawsuit against ibm and its current status in more detail above under part  item of this form k 
on january   we brought suit against novell  inc for slander of title seeking relief for novell s alleged bad faith effort to interfere with our copyrights related to our unix source code and derivative works and our unixware products 
we disclose our lawsuit against novell in more detail above under part i  item of this form k 
during fiscal year  we increased our cash balance as a combined result of improved operations in our core unix business and license fees generated from our scosource initiatives 
to further strengthen our competitive position  allow for investment in our unix business and pursue our intellectual property protection strategy  we issued  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and raised net proceeds of  we believe that our cash and equivalents balance as of october  of  will be adequate for us to execute our current unix business strategy as well as to continue to pursue our intellectual property claims 
our operating strategy for fiscal year includes strengthening our core unix business by investing in our unix technology as well as pursuing our scosource licensing initiatives to protect our rights in the unix source code and our other intellectual property 
business focus we generate revenue primarily from two sources product and services revenue from our unix operating systems business and license fees from our scosource licensing business 
unix business 
our unix business serves the needs of small to medium sized businesses  including replicated site franchisees of fortune companies  by providing reliable  cost effective unix operating systems and software products to power computers running on intel architecture 
our largest source of unix business revenue is derived from our worldwide  indirect  leveraged channel of partners  which includes distributors and independent solution providers 
we have local offices in a number of countries that provide support and services to customers and resellers in that geographic area 
the other principal channel for selling and marketing our unix products is through major corporations that have a large number of replicated sites or franchisees 
we access these corporations through their information technology or purchasing departments with our area sales managers in the united states and through our reseller channel in countries outside the united states 
in addition  we also sell our operating system products to oems through our direct sales team in the united states and our reseller channel in countries outside the united states 
until fiscal year  the majority of our revenue and our operating expenses were derived from our unix business 
the revenue derived from our unix business was   and  for fiscal years ended  and the revenue from this business has been declining in each of the last four years primarily as a result of increased competition from alternative operating systems  particularly linux  lower information technology spending and the general economic slowdown 
in our results of operations  we recognize revenue from agreements for support and maintenance contracts and other long term contracts that have been previously invoiced and are included in deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue balance has declined from  as of october  to  as of october   and this decline in deferred revenue may continue into future quarters  which may have a negative impact on our operating system platform products revenue 
our future operating system platform revenue may be adversely impacted and may continue to decline if we are unable to replenish these deferred revenue balances with long term maintenance and support contracts or replace them with other sustainable revenue streams 
if we are unable to continue to generate positive cash flow and profitable operations  our operations may be adversely impacted 
the decline in our unix business revenue may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support as a result of our scosource initiatives and in particular any lawsuits against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights 
our scosource initiatives  particularly lawsuits against such end users  may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue 
in an effort to offset this decrease in unix revenue  we have significantly decreased our operating costs and increased our gross margin over the last three fiscal years 
operating costs have decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year we have reduced the number of employees and eliminated redundant facilities while still preserving our worldwide infrastructure 
our gross margin percentage from our unix business has increased from percent in fiscal year  to percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year we have accomplished this by reducing excess manufacturing and overhead costs  reducing our third party royalty and technology costs and decreasing the number of employees in our services organization 
an important initiative for our unix business for the fiscal year will be to maintain the level of investment in and commitment to our unix operating systems 
as part of this initiative  we intend to increase our research and development costs for fiscal year and provide our openserver and unixware products with increased system reliability  maintain backward compatibility with existing applications and software  provide increased application support  provide additional hardware support  integrate widely used internet applications and increase system performance 
these enhancements will not have a direct impact on our short term unix revenue because of the long adoption cycle for new operating system purchases and our long operating system product sales cycle 
scosource business 
over the last fiscal year  we became aware that our unix code and derivative works had been inappropriately included in the linux operating system 
we believe the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux has been a major contributor to the decline in our unix business because users of linux generally do not pay for the operating system  only minimal fees  if any  for service and maintenance 
the linux operating system competes directly with our openserver and unixware products and has taken significant market share from these products 
to offset the decline in our unix business and review the status of our unix licensing and sublicensing agreements  we initiated our scosource licensing initiatives in january this effort resulted in the execution of two significant license agreements during fiscal year and generated  in scosource business revenue 
our future success with our scosource initiatives and future revenue from scosource licenses will depend on our ability to protect our unix intellectual property 
we will continue to devote resources to our scosource initiatives  and we expect legal fees and other scosource related costs will substantially increase in fiscal year in addition to pursuing large vendor licensing contracts similar to those executed in fiscal year  we are implementing an ip licensing campaign to linux end users 
this ip licensing effort will allow linux end users to continue to use our unix source code and derivative works found in linux 
we have announced worldwide availability of the ip license and plan to significantly increase our scosource sales team in fiscal to implement these licensing strategies 
because of the uncertainties related to scosource licensing revenue  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue 
this uncertainty represents a significant risk and challenge for us  both in the short and long term 
if we do receive revenue from this source  it may be sporadic and fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our scosource initiatives are unlikely to produce a stable or predictable revenue stream for the foreseeable future 
additionally  the success of these initiatives may depend on the strength of our intellectual property rights and contractual claims regarding unix  including the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivative works are prevalent in linux 
we do not expect significant scosource revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year  but anticipate that revenue from vendor licenses and ip licenses will increase throughout fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current trends  future projections and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances  fair value of derivative financial instrument  impairment of long lived assets  and allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of accounting position sop  as amended  and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
we recognize products revenue and scosource revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable  except for sales to distributors  which are recognized upon sale by the distributor to resellers or end users 
we recognize product revenue from royalty payments upon receipt of quarterly royalty reports from oems related to their product sales 
the majority of our revenue transactions relate to product sales only 
on occasion we have revenue transactions that include multiple elements ie  delivered and undelivered elements including maintenance  support and other services 
for invoices or contracts involving multiple elements we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value 
the fair value of each element is based on amounts charged when such elements are sold in separate transactions 
we recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for revenue recognition set forth above have been met 
estimates used in our revenue recognition include the determination of credit worthiness and verification of sales out reporting to end users through our two tier distribution channel 
to the extent these estimates were inaccurate  our recognized revenue would be adversely impacted and would harm our results of operations 
additionally  if our business conditions change or our revenue contracts begin to contain more multiple elements  our future revenue recognition in future periods may be impacted as a larger component of revenue may be deferred 
as of october   our deferred revenue balance was  and related primarily to product maintenance and support contracts 
deferred income taxes and related valuation allowance 
the amount  and ultimate realization  of our deferred income tax assets depends  in part  upon the tax laws in effect  our future earnings and other future events  the effects of which cannot be determined 
we have provided a valuation allowance of  and  against our entire net deferred tax asset as of october  and the valuation allowance was recorded because of our history of net operating losses and the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income 
fair value of derivative financial instrument 
on october   we issued  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock for  per share 
the net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock were  the terms of the preferred stock include conversion and a number of redemption provisions that represent a derivative financial instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
we determined that the conversion feature allowing the holders of the preferred stock to acquire common shares is an embedded derivative financial instrument that does not qualify as a scope exemption under the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock 
as of october   through the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we determined the initial fair value of the derivative was  and the value of the preferred stock was  we were required to account for the conversion feature as an embedded derivative since the preferred stock instrument did not entitle the holders to equity features such as voting rights and board representation 
significant estimates used by management in the valuation of the preferred stock included an expected term of three years  a yield rate for the security of percent and the value of our common stock of on the date the preferred stock transaction closed 
as of october   the fair value of the derivative was  and the decrease in fair value of  was recorded as other income in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year to account for the derivative  we will mark to market its value at each balance sheet date and will include in our consolidated statement of operations any changes in value as a component of other income or expense 
changes in the value of the derivative may be significant  as the value of our common stock at each balance sheet date will have a significant impact on the value of the derivative 
for example  an increase in the value of our common stock by may require us to record an expense of approximately  and  conversely  a decrease in our common stock by may require us to record income of approximately  additionally  had different estimates been used in the valuation of the derivative  the valuation results could have been materially different than reported  which would have impacted our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long lived asset 
we performed an impairment analysis  utilizing a valuation of our goodwill as of october  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined that the goodwill reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is not impaired 
write downs of intangible assets may be necessary if the future fair value of these assets is less than carrying value 
if the operating trends for our unix business continue to decline or the value of our common stock were to significantly decrease  we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period related to their carrying value of our long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a majority of our customers and require no collateral from these customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable and have applied these policies consistently throughout fiscal years  and our allowance for bad debts based on our historical experience and specific review as of october   was  our past experience has resulted in minimal differences from the actual amounts provided for bad debts and our recorded estimates 
however  our actual bad debts in future periods may differ from our current estimates and the differences may be material  which may have an adverse impact on our future accounts receivable and cash position 
results of operations the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups of the santa cruz operation  which was completed in may  significantly increased our revenue and operating expenses 
results for fiscal year are not directly comparable to fiscal years and because the operating results of the server and professional services groups acquired from the santa cruz operation are only included in our consolidated statement of operations for the last two quarters of fiscal year the following table presents our results of operations for the fiscal years ended october   and years ended october  in thousands statement of operations data revenue products    scosource licensing  services    total revenue    cost of revenue products    scosource licensing  services    total cost of revenue    gross margin    operating expenses sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    restructuring charges   amortization of goodwill and intangibles    loss on disposition and impairment of long lives assets write off of investments   stock based compensation    compensation to law firms  in process research and development  cost sharing arrangement with the santa cruz operation total operating expenses    income loss from operations    equity in losses of affiliates other income expense  net   provision for income taxes net income loss    fiscal years ended october   and revenue change change revenue    revenue for fiscal year increased by  or percent  from fiscal year and this increase was primarily attributable to license fees generated from our scosource licensing initiatives offset by decreases in unix products and services revenue 
revenue for fiscal year increased by  or percent  over fiscal year and this increase was primarily attributable to a full year of acquired operations from the server and professional services groups acquired from the santa cruz operation 
revenue generated from our unix operating divisions americas and international and scosource division was as follows change change americas revenue    percent of total revenue international revenue   percent of total revenue scosource revenue  n a n a percent of total revenue other revenue  n a n a percent of total revenue the decrease in revenue from our international division for the fiscal year compared to prior periods was primarily related to the negative impact of the slowing european economy as well as from increased competition from other operating system products  particularly linux  in europe and asia 
we anticipate for fiscal year that unix revenue generated in the americas and the international divisions will be lower than revenue generated in fiscal year and that the percentage split between these two unix divisions will be generally consistent with that in fiscal year our unix product and services revenue may be lower than currently anticipated if we lose the support of any of our existing hardware and software vendors or our key industry partners withdraw their marketing and certification support or direct their support to our competitors 
this may occur as a result of our scosource initiatives and in particular as a result of any lawsuits we may bring against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights 
products revenue change change products revenue    percent of total revenue our products revenue consists of software licenses for unix products such as openserver and unixware  as well as sales of unix related products 
products revenue also includes revenue derived from oems 
we rely heavily on our two tier distribution channel for approximately percent of our products revenue in the americas and approximately percent of our revenue in our international division  and any disruption in our distribution channel could have an adverse impact on future revenue 
the decrease in products revenue in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was attributable to decreased sales of openserver and unixware products primarily resulting from increased competition in the operating system market  particularly linux  and from a decrease in information technology spending and the worldwide economic slowdown 
this impact was felt in all of our distribution channels and we believe that this competition from linux will continue in future periods 
the increase in product revenue in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily attributable to revenue from a full year s sales of openserver and unixware products acquired as part of the acquisition of the server and professional services groups from the santa cruz operation 
we recognized openserver and unixware revenue only in the final two quarters of fiscal year our products revenue was derived primarily from sales of our openserver and unixware products 
other products revenue consists mainly of product maintenance and other unix related products 
revenue for these products was as follows change change openserver revenue    percent of products revenue unixware revenue    percent of products revenue other products revenue    percent of products revenue scosource licensing revenue change change scosource licensing revenue  n a n a percent of total revenue scosource licensing revenue was  for fiscal year as compared to no revenue from this source for fiscal years and this revenue is the result of our scosource initiatives  including our intellectual property licensing program  launched in january we initiated scosource for the purpose of protecting our intellectual property rights in our unix source code and derivative works 
the scosource licensing revenue in fiscal year represents fees associated with vendor licenses entered into during the fiscal year from sun and microsoft 
in fiscal year  we anticipate continued revenue from our scosource activities in the form of vendor licenses and ip licenses  and that this revenue will be minimal in our first quarter of fiscal year and increase in future quarters 
however  we are unable to predict the amount and timing of revenue from our scosource initiatives for future periods because of our lack of historical experience with this revenue source 
services revenue change change services revenue    percent of total revenue services revenue consists primarily of annual and incident support fees  engineering services fees  professional services and education fees 
these fees are typically charged and invoiced separately from unix products sales 
the decrease in services revenue in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year of  was in part due to a decrease in professional services resulting from a decrease in the demand for our custom enterprise level projects as well as from a decrease in our support services  engineering services and team services agreements 
the increase in services revenue in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily attributable to a full year of revenue in fiscal year generated by the support and professional services groups acquired from the santa cruz operation which generated services revenue for us only in the final two quarters of fiscal year the majority of our support and professional services revenue continues to be derived from services for unix based operating system products 
our future level of services revenue depends in part on our ability to generate unix products revenue from new customers as well as the renewal of certain annual support and services agreements from existing unix customers 
cost of products revenue change change cost of products revenue   percentage of products revenue cost of products revenue includes primarily overhead costs  manufacturing costs  royalties to third party vendors and technology costs 
cost of products revenue decreased by  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced overhead and manufacturing costs resulting from our cost reduction efforts  decreased royalties to third party vendors and lower amortized technology costs 
cost of products revenue increased by  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily because of a full year of costs in fiscal year resulting from the acquired operations from the santa cruz operation 
these costs for the full year were partially offset by our initial undertaking to eliminate duplicate costs in manufacturing overhead 
for fiscal year  we expect our cost of products revenue to be slightly less than in fiscal year cost of scosource licensing revenue change change cost of scosource licensing revenue  n a n a percentage of scosource licensing revenue cost of scosource licensing revenue includes the salaries and related personnel costs of employees dedicated to the scosource licensing initiatives  legal and professional fees incurred in connection with our scosource initiatives  and an allocation of corporate costs 
cost of scosource licensing revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due in part to the unpredictability of the related scosource revenue and the level of legal and professional expenses incurred in connection with our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights 
legal expenses may include contingency payments made to the law firms engaged by us to protect our intellectual property rights 
for fiscal year  we will substantially increase the level of internal resources dedicated to our scosource initiatives as well as substantially increase the level of our legal expenses  however  we are unable to predict the percentage of cost of scosource licensing revenue for future quarters due to the unpredictability of the related licensing revenue 
cost of services revenue change change cost of services revenue   percentage of services revenue cost of services revenue includes the salaries and related personnel costs of employees delivering services revenue as well as third party service agreements 
cost of services revenue decreased by  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was attributable to reduced employee and related costs in our support services and professional services groups as well as the elimination of certain third party support contracts in order to increase the gross margin for these groups 
cost of services revenue increased by  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to a full year of costs in fiscal year resulting from the acquired operations from the santa cruz operation 
for fiscal year  we expect our cost of services revenue to be slightly less than in fiscal year sales and marketing change change sales and marketing expense   percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist of the salaries  commissions and other personnel costs of employees involved in the revenue generation process  as well as advertising and corporate allocations 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year of  and from fiscal year to fiscal year of  was primarily attributable to reductions in sales and marketing employees  reduced travel expenses  and less commissions and lower co operative advertising costs as a result of lower revenue 
our sales and marketing personnel decreased from as of october   to as of october   to as of october  for fiscal year  we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will remain substantially consistent with research and development change change research and development expense   percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist of the salaries and benefits of software engineers  consulting expenses and corporate allocations 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal year of  compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to work force reductions 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal year of  over fiscal year was attributable to development work on our unix operating systems acquired during fiscal year our research and development personnel decreased from as of october   to for fiscal year ends october  and for fiscal year  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase from fiscal year due to our recently initiated efforts to maintain and enhance our unix products 
general and administrative change change general and administrative expense   percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries and benefits of finance  human resources  and executive management and expenses for professional services and corporate allocations 
the decrease in general and administrative expense from fiscal year to fiscal year of  was primarily attributable to staff centralization and reduction programs as well as decreases in external professional services 
the increase from fiscal year to fiscal year of  was primarily attributable to support required for our worldwide operations acquired from the santa cruz operation for the entire fiscal year following the acquisition 
our general and administrative personnel decreased from as of october   to as of october   to as of october  for fiscal year  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in comparison with fiscal year due to the new compliance and reporting regulations under the sarbanes oxley act and other new regulatory requirements  increased legal costs as a result of lawsuits against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights and other litigation costs not categorized as scosource cost of revenue 
restructuring charges change change restructuring charges    percentage of total revenue during fiscal years  and  we recorded restructuring charges totaling   and  respectively 
the restructuring charges for fiscal years  and were comprised of termination payments made to employees in connection with reductions in headcount  closure of certain facilities and adjustments to previously recorded amounts as actual payments made were less than recorded accruals 
the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal years and was primarily attributable to fewer terminated employees and fewer vacated facilities 
the detail of the restructuring charges for fiscal years  and  are as follows in thousands fiscal balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  severance and related   facilities   total     the facilities adjustment of  was recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of the santa cruz operation 
fiscal balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  severance and related   facilities      total      the facilities adjustment of  was the result of successfully re negotiating an existing lease commitment 
fiscal balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  severance and related   facilities  total     the facilities adjustment of  was the result of successfully negotiating out of lease commitments in connection with company s winding down of the sco group  ltd 
amounts to be paid for restructurings are recorded as accrued liabilities 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles change change amortization of goodwill and intangibles   percentage of total revenue during fiscal years  and  we recorded   and  for the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives 
the increase of  in fiscal year over fiscal year was attributed to amortization expense on assets acquired from vultus 
the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributed to a write down of goodwill and intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that decreased the carrying value of these assets 
loss on disposition and impairment of long lived assets change change loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets  percentage of total revenue during fiscal years and  we recorded a write down of long lived assets of  and  respectively  which primarily related to restructurings that occurred during each fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we determined that various long lived assets were impaired and that the book value as of october  exceeded the current estimates of fair value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of  related to the write down of long lived assets of goodwill and intangibles 
this impairment was attributable to unanticipated decreases in actual and forecasted revenue of the acquired operations from the santa cruz operation  a significant decline in economic conditions particular in the information technology sector and a weakening of partner relationships 
the impairment recorded in fiscal year significantly reduced the amortizable base of intangible assets with finite lives  which has resulted in lower amortization on intangibles in the and fiscal years 
write offs of investments change change write offs of investments   percentage of total revenue management routinely assesses our investments for impairments and adjusts the carrying amounts to estimated realizable values when impairment has occurred 
during fiscal year  in connection with the restructuring of our investment in and relationship with vista 
com vista  we recorded a write off our vista investment and incurred a charge of  we had been accounting for our investment in vista under the equity method of accounting 
during fiscal year  we determined that the current carrying value of  related to our investment in lineo  inc would not be recovered and was written off 
this write off was due to a significant deterioration in the operating results of lineo and declines in general economic conditions 
this investment had been accounted for under the cost method 
during fiscal year  we determined the carrying value of our investments in troll tech as  evergreen internet  inc and ebiz enterprises  inc would not be realized 
the necessary write offs were due to declines in general economic conditions and the impact of such declines in the operations of these companies as well as a decline in overall market valuations in these particular industries 
as a result  we determined that the current carrying value of these investments would most likely not be recovered and we recorded write offs of  related to these investments 
we had accounted for our investments in troll tech and evergreen under the cost method and our investment in ebiz under the equity method of accounting 
stock based compensation change change stock based compensation   percentage of total revenue in connection with stock options and restricted shares granted to employees and others  we recorded stock based compensation of  in fiscal year   in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year the increase in stock based compensation in fiscal year when compared with fiscal year is primarily attributable to restricted stock grants 
the fair value of these restricted stock awards was recorded as a component of stock based compensation as the restrictions lapsed 
we also issued a warrant to a consultant which increased our stock based compensation in fiscal year compensation to law firms on february   we entered into an arrangement with boies  schiller flexner llp and other firms to investigate and review our unix intellectual property rights 
this arrangement was later modified on november  and december  the engagement with the law firms now includes the defense work related to counter suits and other retaliatory actions against us and lawsuits against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights 
the law firms are also representing us in our lawsuit against novell 
in addition to receiving fees at reduced hourly rates  our agreement with the law firms provides that the law firms will receive a contingency fee of percent of the proceeds from specified events related to the protection of our intellectual property rights 
these events may include settlements  judgments  certain licensing fees  subject to certain exceptions  and a sale of our company during the pendancy of litigation or through settlement  subject to agreed upon credits for amounts received as discounted hourly fees and unused retainer fees 
additionally  our agreement with the law firms may also be construed to include contingency fee payments in connection with our issuance of equity securities 
future payments payable to the law firms under this arrangement may be significant 
during fiscal year  we incurred a charge of  or percent of revenue  related to this arrangement as contingency fees to these law firms in connection with the issuance of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock 
this charge consisted of a non cash charge of  related to the issuance of  shares of our common stock and a  cash payment that was accrued as of october  and paid subsequent to year end 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of the server and professional services groups of the santa cruz operation  we recorded a charge of  or percent of total revenue  in fiscal year for the fair value of in process research and development 
the write off was necessary because the acquired in process research and development related to unixware and messaging server products had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
development work on the unixware and messaging server products were substantially complete at the end of fiscal year we did not have any charges for in process research and development in fiscal years and cost sharing arrangement with the santa cruz operation after entering into the agreement with the santa cruz operation to acquire the server and professional services groups  we and the santa cruz operation agreed that we would reimburse the santa cruz operation for certain employee payroll and related costs 
we viewed these employees as a critical part of the success of the new combined company and the santa cruz operation agreed to retain the employees if we would reimburse the santa cruz operation for a portion of its payroll and related costs 
in fiscal year  we reimbursed  or percent of total revenue  to the santa cruz operation for services rendered under the agreement 
we did not have any such charges in fiscal years and equity in losses of affiliate we account for our ownership interests in companies that we own at least percent and less than percent using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we record our portion of the entities net income or net loss in our consolidated statements of operation 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded   and  respectively  that related to net losses in these entities 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  which consists principally of interest expense  interest income and the change in fair value of the derivative related to our series a convertible preferred stock  was  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded income of  related to the change in fair value of the derivative related to our series a convertible preferred stock 
exclusive of this income  our net other expense was 
the decrease in fiscal years and from fiscal year is primarily attributable to significantly less interest income earned as a result of lower cash balances 
our other income expense  net  will be unpredictable in future periods because changes in the value of the derivative may be significant and will continue to be recorded until the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock have converted their shares into shares of our common stock 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the provision for income taxes is primarily related to earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
as of october   we had net operating loss carry forwards for us federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately  that expire at various dates between and we had net deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences between book and tax deductions  totaling approximately  as of october  we also had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately  related to taxes on foreign earnings 
a valuation allowance in the amount of  the difference between our deferred tax assets and liabilities  has been recorded as of october  as a result of uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizability of the net deferred tax asset balance 
dividends related to series a convertible preferred stock on october   we issued  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock for  per share 
the net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock were  the initial value of the preferred stock was bifurcated into two elements consisting of a derivative valued at  and the remaining preferred stock valued at  dividends will be paid after the first anniversary of the closing and will be paid quarterly at a rate of percent per annum  subject to annual increases of percent per annum  not to exceed percent per annum 
because dividends are not payable during the first year the preferred stock is outstanding  we have accrued dividends of  for fiscal year  which reduced earnings available to common stockholders 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the last eight quarters 
this information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which  in management s opinion  have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

as a result of the factors listed above and elsewhere in the forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results and financial condition and risk factors sections of this form k  it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may fall below management s expectations as well as the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if revenue falls below management s expectations in any quarter and we are unable to reduce spending  our operating results would be lower than expected 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balance increased from  as of october  to  as of october  our working capital increased from a deficit of  as of october  to  as of october  during fiscal year  we generated positive cash flow from operations for the first time in our operating history 
this was achieved through reductions in costs and increased gross margin generated from our unix business and significant license revenue generated from our scosource business 
we also completed the placement of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of  in october we intend to use the proceeds from this offering as well as our other cash resources to maintain and enhance our unix business and pursue our scosource initiatives 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months 
our net cash provided by operations during fiscal year was  cash provided by operations was attributable to net income of  non cash expenses totaled  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 
our working capital position increased from a deficit of  as of october  to  as of october  primarily because of our increase in cash from our private placement 
our long term liabilities decreased from  to  during fiscal year cash used in operations during fiscal year was  and was primarily attributable to the net loss of  partially offset by non cash expenses of  and cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  cash used in operations declined in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily attributable to our cost cutting actions 
net cash used in operations during fiscal year was  cash used in operations was primarily attributable to the net loss of  which was offset by non cash charges of  cash used in operating activities as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities was 
our investing activities have historically consisted of equipment purchases  investing in strategic partners and the purchase and sale of available for sale securities 
during fiscal year  cash used in investing activities was  which was primarily a result of our purchase of available for sale securities of  equipment purchases of  our investment in non marketable securities of  during fiscal year  we may invest in or acquire vertical application providers as part of our strategy to improve our core unix business operations 
during fiscal year  cash provided by investing activities was  which was primarily generated from the sale of  of available for sale securities  offset by an investment in a non marketable security of  cash paid for the purchase of equipment of  and payment of  to the santa cruz operation 
cash provided by investing activities was  during fiscal year this consisted of  paid  net of cash acquired  for certain acquisitions as well as  paid for the purchase of equipment 
the cash uses were offset by proceeds from sales of available for sale securities  net of purchases  of  our financing activities provided  during the fiscal year and consisted primarily of net proceeds of  generated from the issuance of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
additional financing activities included proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of  proceeds from the purchase of shares of common stock by our employees through our employee stock purchase program of  and proceeds from the issuance of warrants of  our financing activities used  during fiscal year and consisted primarily of a  payment to retire the note payable to the santa cruz operation and  for the purchase of shares of our common stock held by two investors 
these payments were offset by  of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and  received from employees who purchased shares of our common stock through our employee stock purchase program 
during fiscal year  our financing activities provided  as a result of the exercise of vested stock options of  the purchase of shares of common stock through our employee stock purchase program of  and from minority stockholders in our majority owned japanese subsidiary of  our series a convertible preferred stock includes redemption provisions that may be triggered by events beyond our control 
these redemption provisions are triggered by events including delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market  failure to have the series a convertible preferred stock investors form s registration statement declared effective in a timely manner and other events 
these redemption provisions  if triggered  would require us to redeem the then issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock for cash 
if we were required to pay cash to the holders of our preferred stock  it could have a material impact on our liquidity  which may require us to obtain additional sources of cash to sustain operations 
dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock will begin to accrue after the first anniversary of the closing and will be paid quarterly at a rate of percent per annum  subject to annual increases of percent per annum  not to exceed percent per annum 
because dividends are not payable during the first year the preferred stock is outstanding  we have accrued dividends of  for fiscal year dividends may be paid in cash or additional shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  subject to certain limitations 
our net accounts receivable balance increased from  as of october  to  as of october   primarily as a result of higher invoicing in the fourth quarter of fiscal year when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year the majority of our accounts receivable are current and our allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of october   which represented approximately percent of our gross accounts receivable balance 
this percentage of gross accounts receivable is consistent with our experience in prior periods  and we expect this trend to continue 
our write offs of uncollectible accounts during fiscal year were not significant 
we recently expanded our efforts with the law firms assisting us with our pursuit of our intellectual property claims and currently expect to devote substantially more financial resources to this effort 
we expect that legal fees paid to the law firms we have engaged to pursue these claims will increase substantially in fiscal year to the extent that scosource related costs and legal fees exceed our budgeted amounts for fiscal year  our liquidity will be adversely impacted and fewer financial resources will be available for other initiatives such as maintaining and enhancing our unix business 
in addition to paying fees at reduced hourly rates to these firms  our agreement with the law firms provides that we will pay the law firms a contingency fee of percent of the proceeds from specified events related to the protection of our intellectual property rights 
these events may include settlements  judgments  certain licensing fees  subject to certain exceptions  and a sale of our company during the pendancy of litigation or through settlement  subject to agreed upon credits for amounts received as discounted hourly fees and unused retainer fees 
additionally  our agreement with the law firms may also be construed to include contingency fee payments in connection with our issuance of equity securities 
future payments payable to the law firms under this arrangement may be significant in future periods  which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
this arrangement could also impair our ability to raise equity capital in future periods and increase the cost of such equity 
we have entered into operating leases for our corporate offices located in the united states and our international sales offices 
we have commitments under these leases that extend through fiscal year in recent corporate restructuring activities  we have partially vacated some of these facilities  but still have contractual obligations to continue to make ongoing lease payments for one facility that will use available cash 
we have pursued and will continue to pursue sublease opportunities  as available  to minimize this use of cash  however  we may not be successful in eliminating or reducing cash expenditures for this facility 
the following table summarizes our contractual lease obligations as of october  total less than year years more than years operating lease obligations    as of october   we did not have any long term debt obligations  purchase obligations  other long term liabilities or material capital lease obligations 
our ability to cut costs to offset revenue declines in our unix business is limited because of contractual commitments to maintain and support our existing unix customers 
this decline in our unix business may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support as a result of our scosource initiatives and in particular any lawsuits against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights 
our scosource initiatives  particularly lawsuits against such end users  may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue 
if our unix products and services revenue is less than expected  our liquidity will be adversely impacted 
in the event that cash required to fund operations and strategic initiatives exceeds our current cash resources and cash generated from operations  we will be required to reduce costs and perhaps raise additional capital 
we may not be able to reduce costs in a manner that does not impair our ability to maintain our unix business and pursue our scosource initiatives 
we may also not be able to raise capital for any number of reasons including those listed under the section risk factors below 
our ability to raise additional equity capital is restricted under the terms of our series a convertible preferred stock 
if additional equity financing is available  it may not be available to us on attractive terms and may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
our ability to raise debt financing is restricted under the terms of our series a convertible preferred stock 
in addition  if our stock price declines  we may not be able to access the public equity markets on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to effect acquisitions for stock would also be impaired 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
is effective for interim periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
for our fiscal year ended october  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
financial instruments within the scope of sfas no

many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we have foreign offices and operations in europe and asia 
as a result  a portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
most of this international revenue is denominated in us dollars 
however  most of the operating expenses related to the foreign based operations are denominated in foreign currencies and therefore operating results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the euro  among others 
if the us dollar continues to weaken compared to the euro  our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when translated back into us dollars 
our revenue can also be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
our results of operations may be affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts for market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments 
the criteria we use for designating an instrument include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of forward exchange contracts to underlying assets and liabilities 
gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are firm commitments are deferred and recognized in income in the same period that the underlying transactions are settled 
gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are designated and effective for existing transactions are recognized in income in the same period as losses and gains on the underlying transactions are recognized and generally offset 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income in the current period 
as of october   we had one foreign exchange contract with a maturity of days to sell an aggregate of  united kingdom pounds for approximately  us dollars 
we also had one foreign exchange contract with a maturity of days to buy  euros for approximately  us dollars 
as of october   we had no outstanding instruments classified as hedges 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our cash management strategy is to invest available funds in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and maximizes yield within such constraints 
we do not borrow money for short term investment purposes 
investment risk 
we have invested in equity instruments of privately held and public companies in the technology industry for business and strategic purposes 
investments are accounted for under the cost method if our ownership is less than percent and we are not able to exercise influence over operations 
our investment policy is to regularly review the assumptions and operating performance of these companies and to record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired 
as of october   our investments balance was approximately  the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by our competitors or developments in the litigation related to our scosource initiatives may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in our results of operations caused by changes in customer demand may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these conditions could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time 
forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results and financial condition with the exception of historical facts  the statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which reflect our current expectations and beliefs regarding our future results of operations  performance and achievements 
the section entitled business above in part i  item of this form k also includes forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based upon assumptions and beliefs that may or may not materialize 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements concerning our operating strategy to continue to support our existing users of our unix operating system products and to maintain and enhance our core unix business and pursue scosource licensing opportunities and protect our intellectual property rights  our belief that our openserver and unixware products will continue to provide a revenue stream  our intent to maintain the level of investment in and commitment to our operating systems and web services software by continuing our research and development efforts  our intention to enhance and modernize our unix operating system and our expectation that our investment in this effort will give customers confidence in our technology  our intention to continue to pursue our scosource initiatives in fiscal year and our plan to increase our scosource sales team and internal personnel in fiscal year  our belief that the future success of our scosource initiatives will depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property  our intention to vigorously defend legal claims and counterclaims brought against us by others  our intention to pursue our litigation against ibm and commence in the near term our first legal action against an end user violating our intellectual property and contractual rights  our belief that our cash balance will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy as well as to continue to pursue our intellectual property claims and that we have sufficient cash reserves to fund our current operations for at least the next months  our intention to expand our relationships with key partners in certain vertical markets  our international marketing strategy  our expectation of entering into future vendor license agreements with developers  manufacturers  distributors and end users of operating systems  our belief that our allowance and bad debts for accounts receivable will remain consistent with our prior experience  the strength of our intellectual property rights and contractual claims regarding unix generally and specifically the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivatives of unix source code are prevalent in linux  our expectation that scosource licensing revenue will be minimal in the first quarter of fiscal year and will increase in future quarters of fiscal year  our expectation that the majority of our services revenue will continue to be derived from unix based products  our expectation for fiscal year that our cost of products revenue will be slightly less than in fiscal year  our expectation for fiscal year that our cost of services revenue will be slightly less than in fiscal year  our expectation for fiscal year that our sales and marketing expenses will remain substantially consistent with our expenses incurred in fiscal year  our expectation for fiscal year that our research and development expenses will increase from fiscal year  our expectation for fiscal year that our general and administrative expenses will increase compared to our general and administrative expenses incurred in fiscal year  our belief that our legal costs will increase in fiscal year  our expectation that we may invest in or acquire vertical application providers and pursue strategic alliances with industry participants and licensing transactions as part of our strategy to improve our core unix business  our belief that our facilities are adequate for our business  and our belief that certain legal actions to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on us 
we wish to caution readers that our operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or anticipated  including the success of our scosource initiatives  competition from other operating systems  particularly linux  the amount and timing of scosource licensing revenue  our ability to enhance our unix operating systems and maintain our unix products and services business  and the factors set forth in the subsection entitled risk factors below 
we also wish to advise readers not to place any undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this report  which reflect our beliefs and expectations only as of the date of this report 
we assume no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances or any changes in our beliefs or expectations  other than as required by law 
risk factors we do not have a history of profitable operations 
our fiscal year ended october  was the first full year we were profitable in our operating history 
our profitability in fiscal year resulted primarily from our scosource licensing initiative 
if we do not receive scosource licensing revenue in future quarters and our revenue from the sale of our operating system platform products and services continues to decline  we will need to further reduce operating expenses to maintain profitability or generate positive cash flow 
our unix products and services revenue has declined in each of the last four years 
in our results of operations  we recognize revenue from agreements for support and maintenance contracts and other long term contracts that have been previously invoiced and are included in deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue balance has declined from  as of october  to  as of october   and this decline in deferred revenue may continue into future quarters  which may have a negative impact on our operating system platform products revenue 
our future operating system platform revenue may be adversely impacted and may continue to decline if we are unable to replenish these deferred revenue balances with long term maintenance and support contracts or replace them with other sustainable revenue streams 
if we are unable to continue to generate positive cash flow and profitable operations  our operations may be adversely impacted 
additionally  we accounted for the issuance of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock from our october private placement by bifurcating the value of the series a convertible preferred stock into a preferred stock component and a derivative component 
as of october   we recorded a liability of  as the fair value of the derivative component 
to account for the derivative component in subsequent periods  we will mark to market its value at each balance sheet date and will include in our consolidated statement of operations any changes in value as a component of other income or expense 
changes in the value of the derivative may be significant because the value of our common stock at each balance sheet date will have a significant impact on the derivative s value 
for example  an increase in the value of our common stock by may require us to record an expense of approximately  and  conversely  a decrease in our common stock by may require us to record income of approximately  if this accounting treatment requires us to record significant expenses in future periods  our profitability in those periods may be adversely impacted 
our future scosource licensing revenue is uncertain 
we initiated the scosource licensing effort in january to review the status of unix licensing and sublicensing agreements 
this effort resulted in the execution of two significant vendor license agreements during fiscal year and generated  in revenue 
due to a lack of historical experience and the uncertainties related to scosource licensing revenue  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue  if any 
if we do receive revenue from this source  it may be sporadic and fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our scosource initiatives are unlikely to produce a stable or predictable revenue stream for the foreseeable future 
additionally  the success of this initiative may depend on the strength of our intellectual property rights and contractual claims regarding unix  including  the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivative works are prevalent in linux 
we may not prevail in our legal actions against ibm and novell  and unintended consequences of our actions against ibm and novell and initiatives to assert our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business 
on or about march   we filed a complaint against ibm alleging breach of contract  misappropriation of trade secrets  tortious interference  and unfair competition 
the matter is currently pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
the complaint also alleges that ibm obtained information concerning our unix source code and derivative works from us and inappropriately used and distributed that information in connection with its efforts to promote the linux operating system 
on or about june   we filed an amended complaint in the ibm case 
the amended complaint essentially restates and realleges the allegations of the original complaint and expands on those claims in several ways 
most importantly  the amended complaint raises new allegations regarding ibm s actions and breaches through the products and services of sequent which ibm acquired 
we allege that ibm breached the sequent agreement in several ways similar to those set forth above  and we are seeking damages flowing from those breaches 
we are also seeking injunctive relief on several of our claims 
ibm has filed a response and counterclaim to the complaint  including a demand for jury trial 
we have filed an answer to the ibm counterclaim denying the claims and asserting affirmative defenses 
in its counterclaim  as amended on september   ibm asserts that we do not have the right to terminate its unix license or assert claims based on our ownership of unix intellectual property against them or others in the linux community 
in addition  they assert that we have infringed on certain patents held by ibm 
ibm s counterclaims include claims for breach of contract  violation of the lanham act  unfair competition  intentional interference with prospective economic relations  unfair and deceptive trade practices  breach of the gnu general public license  and patent infringement 
discovery is ongoing in the case 
we intend to vigorously defend these counterclaims 
if we do not prevail in our action against ibm  or if ibm is successful in its counterclaim against us  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
the litigation with ibm and potentially others could be costly  and our costs for legal fees may be substantial and in excess of amounts for which we have budgeted 
additionally  the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected as a result of developments in our legal action against ibm that may be  or may be perceived to be  adverse to us 
in addition  we have publicly  and in individual letters to  of the world s largest corporations  cautioned users of linux that there are unresolved intellectual property issues surrounding linux that may expose them to unanticipated liability 
as a result of these concerns  we have suspended our sales of linux products 
we have also begun delivering written notice to a large number of licensees under our unix contracts requiring them to  among other things  provide written certification that they are in full compliance with their agreements  including certification that they are not using our proprietary unix code in linux  have not allowed unauthorized use of licensed unix code by their employees or contractors and have not breached confidentiality provisions relating to licensed unix code 
additionally  we have begun notifying selected linux end users in writing of violations we allege under the digital millennium copyright act related to our copyrights contained in linux 
as a result of our action against ibm and our scosource initiatives to protect our intellectual property rights  several participants in the linux industry and others affiliated with ibm or sympathetic to the linux movement have taken actions attempting to negatively affect our business and our scosource efforts 
linux proponents have taken a broad range of actions against us  including  for example  attempting to influence participants in the markets in which we sell our products to reduce or eliminate the amount of our products and services they purchase from us 
we expect that similar efforts likely will continue 
there is a risk that participants in our marketplace will negatively view our action against ibm and our scosource initiatives  and we may lose support from such participants 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our position in the marketplace  our results of operations and our stock price 
we have also experienced several denial of service attacks on our website  which have prevented web users from accessing our website and doing business with us for a period of time 
additionally  we have recently experienced a distributed denial of service attack as a result of the mydoom worm virus 
it is reported that the effects of this virus will continue into february if such attacks continue or if our customers and strategic partners are also subjected to similar attacks  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
also  some of the more significant participants in the linux industry have made efforts to ease linux end users concerns that their use of linux may subject them to potential copyright infringement claims from us 
for example  hewlett packard and novell have each established indemnification programs for qualified customers purchasing linux based products and services that may potentially become subject to a copyright infringement claims from us 
additionally  open source development labs  a non profit organization osdl  has established a legal defense fund that will be used to defend linux users against copyright infringement lawsuits brought by us 
it has been reported that osdl so far has attracted several million dollars in pledges from contributors including ibm and intel among others 
similarly  red hat  inc has announced it has committed one million dollars for a separate fund it created to cover the legal expenses of other companies developing linux 
as a further response to our scosource initiatives and claim that our unix source code and derivative works have inappropriately been included in linux  novell has publicly asserted its belief that it owns certain copyrights in our unix source code  and it has filed copyright applications with the united states copyright office related to unix 
novell also claims that it has a license to unix from us and the right to authorize its customers to use unix technology in their internal business operations 
specifically  novell has also claimed to have retained rights related to legacy unix svrx licenses  including the license with ibm 
novell asserts it has the right to take action on behalf of sco in connection with such licenses  including termination rights 
novell has purported to veto our termination of the ibm  sequent and sgi licenses 
we have repeatedly asserted that we obtained the unix business  source code  claims and copyrights when we acquired the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups from the santa cruz operation in may  which had previously acquired all such assets and rights from novell in september pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  as amended 
on january   in response to novell s actions  we brought suit against novell for slander of title seeking relief for novell s alleged bad faith effort to interfere with our copyrights related to our unix source code and derivative works and our unixware products 
novell has not yet responded to our complaint 
among our allegations in the suit against novell  we allege that novell has improperly filed copyright registrations in the united states copyright office for unix technology covered by our copyrights and has made false and misleading public claims that it  and not our company  owns the unix and unixware copyrights 
we also allege that novell has made false statements with the intent to cause customers and potential customers to not do business with us and has attempted  in bad faith  to block our ability to enforce our copyrights 
additionally  we allege that novell s false and misleading representations that it owns the unix and unixware copyrights have caused us irreparable harm to our copyrights  our business  and our reputation 
in the lawsuit  we request preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as damages 
the injunction would require novell to assign to us all copyrights that we believe novell has wrongfully registered  prevent novell from representing any ownership interest in those copyrights  and require novell to retract or withdraw all representations it has made regarding its purported ownership of those copyrights 
notwithstanding our assertions of full ownership of unix related intellectual property rights  as set forth above  including copyrights  and even if we are successful in our legal action against novell  the efforts of novell and the other linux proponents described above may cause linux end users to be less willing to purchase from us our sco ip licenses authorizing their use of our intellectual property contained in the linux operating system  which may adversely affect our revenue from our scosource initiatives 
these efforts also may increase the negative view some participants in our marketplace have regarding our legal actions against ibm and novell and our scosource initiatives and may contribute to creating confusion in the marketplace about the validity of our claim that the unauthorized use of our unix source code and derivative works in linux infringes on our copyrights 
increased negative perception and potential confusion about our claims in our marketplace could impede our continued pursuit of our scosource initiatives and negatively impact our business 
additionally  if we fail in our lawsuit against novell  the negative perception and confusion in our marketplace about our intellectual property claims likely would increase significantly  and the effectiveness of our scosource initiatives could be materially harmed 
we may lose the support of industry partners leading to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue 
our scosource initiatives  particularly lawsuits against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights  may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue and would adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity 
our claims relating to our unix intellectual property may subject us to additional legal proceedings 
on or about august   red hat filed a complaint against us that is currently pending in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
red hat has asserted that the linux operating system does not infringe on our unix intellectual property rights and seeks a declaratory judgment for non infringement of copyrights and no misappropriation of trade secrets 
in addition  red hat claims we have engaged in false advertising in violation of the lanham act  deceptive trade practices  unfair competition  tortious interference with prospective business opportunities  and trade libel and disparagement 
we have filed a motion to dismiss the red hat complaint  asserting that red hat lacks standing and that no case or controversy exists on which to base a declaratory judgment 
red hat has filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss  but the court has not ruled on the motion 
if red hat is successful in its claim against us  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
the australian competition and consumer commission accc contacted us in august regarding complaints it has received concerning our intellectual property claims and our statements regarding the need for commercial linux users to obtain a unix license 
the accc further informed us that it has not made any decision to pursue the complaints it has received or determined what  if any  action it will take 
we have hired counsel in australia and responded to the accc s request for information 
we have not heard from the accc and it is unknown if future action will be taken 
several entities in germany have obtained temporary restraining orders in germany precluding our german subsidiary  from making statements in germany that  in substance  disparage linux  or entities involved in the linux industry  or implicate linux as infringing our intellectual property rights 
sco gmbh has received an administrative fine of  euros for a technical violation of one of the temporary restraining orders 
we are currently negotiating with the various claimants in germany over the temporary restraining orders and are evaluating whether we will appeal the administrative fine 
informal complaints similar to those raised in germany have been received from companies in austria and poland 
we have responded to those complaints 
it is not known if those complainants will take future action 
in addition to these above mentioned actions  other regulators or others in the linux community may initiate legal actions against us  all of which may negatively impact our operations or future operating performance 
fluctuations in our operating results or the failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors may negatively impact our stock price 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  even in the short term  could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
because of the potential for significant fluctuations in our scosource licensing revenue in any particular period  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
factors that may affect our results include our ability to successfully negotiate and complete licensing and other agreements related to our intellectual property  the interest level of resellers in recommending our unix business solutions to end users  the introduction  development  timing  competitive pricing and market acceptance of our products and services and those of our competitors  changes in general economic conditions  such as recessions  that could affect capital expenditures and recruiting efforts in the software industry  changes to  or developments  in our on going litigation with ibm  novell and red hat concerning our unix intellectual property  changes in business attitudes toward unix as a viable operating system compared to other competing systems  especially linux  the contingency fees we may pay to the law firms representing us in our efforts to establish our intellectual property rights  and changes in attitudes of customers and partners due to our aggressive position against the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux and our lawsuits against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights 
we also experience fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in europe and the asia pacific regions due to seasonal slowdowns and economic conditions in these areas 
seasonal slowdowns in these regions typically occur during the summer months 
as a result of the factors listed above and elsewhere  it is possible that our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in any particular period 
this could cause our stock price to decline 
if revenue falls below our expectations and we are unable to quickly reduce our spending in response  our operating results will be lower than expected 
our stock price may fall in response to these events 
we rely on our indirect sales channel for distribution of our products  and any disruption of our channel at any level could adversely affect the sales of our products 
we have a two tiered distribution channel 
the relationships we have developed with resellers allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to reach through our own direct sales and marketing efforts 
some solution providers also purchase solutions through our resellers  and we anticipate they will continue to do so 
because we usually sell indirectly through resellers  we cannot control the relationships through which resellers  solution providers or equipment integrators purchase our products 
in turn  we do not control the presentation of our products to end users 
therefore  our sales could be affected by disruptions in the relationships between us and our resellers  between our resellers and solution providers  or between solution providers and end users 
also  resellers and solution providers may choose not to emphasize our products to their customers 
any of these occurrences could diminish the effectiveness of our distribution channel and lead to decreased sales 
if the market for unix continues to contract  it may adversely affect our business 
our revenue from the sale of unix based products has declined over the last four years 
this decrease in revenue has been attributable primarily to increased competition from other operating systems  particularly linux  lower information technology spending and the worldwide economic slowdown 
if the demand for unix based products continues to decline  and we are unable to develop unix products and services that successfully address a market demand  our business will be adversely affected 
because of the long adoption cycle for operating system purchases and the long sales cycle of our operating system products  we will not be able to reverse these revenue declines quickly 
we operate in a highly competitive market and face significant competition from a variety of current and potential sources  many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and technical resources than we do  thus  we may fail to compete effectively 
in the unix operating system market  our competitors include ibm  hewlett packard  sun  microsoft and linux distributors 
these and other competitors are aggressively pursuing the current unix operating system market 
many of these competitors have access to substantially greater resources than we do 
the major competitive alternatives to our unix products are microsoft windows server  linux and other unix systems 
the expansion of microsoft s and our other competitors offerings may restrict the overall market available for our server products  including some markets where we have been successful in the past 
our future success may depend in part on our ability to continue to meet the increasing needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging technologies 
if we do not enhance our products to meet these evolving needs  we may not remain competitive and be able to grow our business 
additionally  because technological advancement in the unix operating system market and alternative operating system markets is at an advanced pace  we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and any new products on a timely basis to keep pace with these developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our failure to meet any of these and other competitive pressures may render our existing products and services obsolete  which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and operations 
the success of our unix business will depend on the level of commitment and certification we receive from industry partners and developers 
in recent years  we have seen hardware and software vendors as well as software developers turn their certification and application development efforts toward linux and elect not to continue to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
if this trend continues  our competitive position will be adversely impacted and our future revenue from our unix business will decline 
the decline in our unix business may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support from us as a result of our scosource initiatives and in particular any lawsuit against end users violating our intellectual property and contractual rights 
our compensation arrangement with the law firms representing us to enforce our intellectual property rights may reduce our ability to raise additional financing 
our compensation arrangement with the law firms representing us in our efforts to establish our intellectual property rights could inhibit our ability to raise additional funding if needed 
in addition to receiving fees at reduced hourly rates  our agreement with the law firms provides that the law firms will receive a contingency fee of percent of the proceeds from specified events related to the protection of our intellectual property rights 
these events may include settlements  judgments  certain licensing fees  subject to certain exceptions  and a sale of our company during the pendancy of litigation or through settlement  subject to agreed upon credits for amounts received as discounted hourly fees and unused retainer fees  and our agreement with the law firms may also be construed to include contingency fee payments in connection with issuances of our equity securities 
future payments payable to the law firms under this arrangement may be significant 
our law firms right to receive such contingent payments could cause prospective investors to choose not to invest in our company or limit the price at which new investors would be willing to provide additional funds to our company 
our foreign based operations and sales create special problems  including the imposition of governmental controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could hurt our results 
we have foreign operations  including development facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations in europe  latin america and asia 
these foreign operations are subject to certain inherent risks  including potential loss of developed technology through piracy  misappropriation  or more lenient laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of governmental controls  including trade restrictions and other tax requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries  seasonal reductions in business activity  and political unrest  particularly in areas where we have facilities 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in local currencies  creating risk of foreign currency translation losses that could harm our financial results and cash flows 
when we generate profits in foreign countries  our effective income tax rate is increased 
in latin america and asia in particular  several countries have suffered and may be especially susceptible to recessions and economic instability which may lead to increased governmental ownership or regulation of the economy  higher interest rates  increased barriers to entry such as higher tariffs and taxes  and reduced demand for goods manufactured in the united states  resulting in lower revenue 
the impact of domestic and global economic conditions may continue to adversely impact our operations 
during the last several quarters the us and european economies have experienced an economic slowdown that has affected the purchasing habits of many consumers across many industries and across many geographies 
this has caused the delay  or even cancellation of technology purchases 
the slowdown in the united states and europe  together with the alleged unauthorized use of our unix code  has resulted in decreased sales of our products  longer sales cycles and lower prices 
if the current slowdown continues  our revenue and results of operations may continue to be lower than expected 
in addition  the slowdown may also affect the end user market making it more difficult for our reseller channel to sell our products 
if we are unable to retain key personnel in an intensely competitive environment  our operations could be adversely affected 
we will need to retain our management  technical  and support personnel 
competition for qualified professionals in the software industry is intense  and departures of existing personnel could be disruptive to our business and can result in the departure of other employees 
the loss or departure of any officers or key employees could harm our ability to implement our business plan and could adversely affect our operations 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of our management team  particularly darl c 
mcbride  our president and chief executive officer 
we do not maintain key person insurance for any member of our management team 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price for our common stock has been volatile  ranging from a low closing sales price of in mid february  to a sales price of per share in october  to a current sales price of on january  the share price has changed dramatically over short periods with increases and decreases of over percent in a single day 
we believe that the changes in our stock price are affected by changing public perceptions concerning the strength of our intellectual property claims and other factors beyond our control 
public perception can change quickly and without any change or development in our underlying business or litigation position 
an investment in our stock is subject to such volatility and is subject to significant risk 
the shares offered under our recently completed private placement may have an adverse impact on the market value of our stock and the existing holders of our common stock 
we have filed a prospectus relating to the sale or distribution of up to  shares of common stock by the selling stockholders 
we will not receive any proceeds from the sales of these shares 
the shares subject to the prospectus represent approximately percent of our issued and outstanding common stock  although no selling stockholder and its affiliates may beneficially own more than percent of our common stock at any time 
the sale of this block of stock  or even the possibility of its sale  may adversely affect the trading market for our common stock and reduce the price available in that market 
the shares of common stock subject to our prospectus will  upon issuance  dilute the equity ownership percentage of the holders of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock also could decline as a result of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market  or the perception that such sales could occur 
risks associated with the potential exercise of our options outstanding 
as of december   we have issued and outstanding options to purchase up to approximately  shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the existence of such rights to acquire common stock at fixed prices may prove a hindrance to our efforts to raise future equity and debt funding  and the exercise of such rights will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our stockholders and may dilute the value of their ownership 
the possible future sale of shares issuable on the exercise of outstanding options could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
further  the holders of the outstanding rights may exercise them at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable to us 
the holders of shares of series a convertible preferred stock have preferential redemption rights and rights upon liquidation that could adversely affect the holders of our common stock 
if the selling stockholders choose not to convert shares of series a convertible preferred stock  then  as holders of shares of series a convertible preferred stock  among other rights  they will be entitled to require us to repurchase for cash all the shares of series a convertible preferred stock held by them at a premium price if any of several redemption trigger events occurs 
our redemption obligation may be triggered by events that are beyond our control 
these redemption provisions  if triggered  would require us to redeem the then issued and outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock for cash 
if we were required to pay cash to the holders of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  it could have a material impact on our liquidity  which may require us to obtain additional sources of cash to sustain operations and may negatively impact the holders of our common stock 
additionally  the holders of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock will be entitled to receive a preferential distribution of our assets prior to any distribution to our holders of common stock upon a liquidation  dissolution  winding up or other change in control transaction in which we sell all or substantially all our assets or merge or consolidate or otherwise combine with another company or entity 
upon the occurrence of a liquidation event  the holders of series a convertible preferred stock will be entitled to receive the greater of the value of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock held by them determined by multiplying the closing sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market on the date of the liquidation event by the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred shares could be converted at the time of the liquidation event  or up to  the aggregate purchase price paid by the selling stockholders for shares of series a convertible preferred stock in our private placement  plus eight percent of that amount less the amount of any dividends paid to the preferred stockholders in the calendar year in which the liquidation event occurs 
depending on the amount of assets we have available for distribution to stockholders upon a liquidation event when shares of series a convertible preferred stock remain outstanding  we may be required to distribute all such assets or a portion of such assets that exceeds the preferred stockholders pro rata ownership of our common stock assuming full conversion of their preferred shares into common stock  which could eliminate or limit the assets available for distribution to our common stockholders 
our potential obligation to pay to the law firms representing us in our efforts to establish our intellectual property rights a contingent fee of percent of the proceeds we receive from a sale of our company  subject to certain limitations  could also contribute to eliminating or limiting the assets available for distribution to our common stockholders 
the rights of the selling stockholders as holders of shares of series a convertible preferred stock may prevent or make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds or take other significant company actions 
the certificate of designation creating our series a convertible preferred stock requires us to obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding series a convertible preferred stock to take the following actions  among others change the rights  preferences or privileges of the series a convertible preferred stock or issue additional shares of series a convertible preferred stock  create or issue any other securities that are senior or equal in rank to the series a convertible preferred stock  create or issue any convertible securities having floating conversion rate terms or a fixed conversion price below or the closing sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market on the date of such issuance  incur any indebtedness  subject to limited exceptions  or sell or transfer any material asset or intellectual property to a third party 
the certificate of designation also provides that the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock have a participation right entitling them to purchase their pro rata share of any future equity securities  or debt that is convertible into equity  on the same terms offered by us to other purchasers of such securities 
additionally  we have agreed with the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock that we will not complete a transaction or take any action that could result in a claim for a contingency payment by the law firms representing us in our efforts to establish our intellectual property rights  other than contingency payments related to certain license transactions  without first obtaining the consent of the investors holding at least two thirds of the shares of our series a convertible preferred stock 
this right of consent  and the participation right and other approval rights described above  may make it more difficult for management  our board of directors or our stockholders to reach a settlement in our litigation with ibm  raise capital in the future in either equity or debt financing transactions or to take other significant company actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future 
the right of our board of directors to authorize additional shares of preferred stock could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock 
our board of directors currently has the right  with respect to the  shares of our preferred stock not designated as series a convertible preferred stock  to authorize the issuance of one or more additional series of our preferred stock with such voting  dividend and other rights as our directors determine 
the board of directors can designate new series of preferred stock without the approval of the holders of our common stock  subject to the approval rights of our holders of series a convertible preferred stock as described above 
the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of any holders of additional shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future  including without limitation  further dilution of the equity ownership percentage of our holders of common stock and their voting power if we issue preferred stock with voting rights 
additionally  the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock
