with respect to our designware core intellectual property products  we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements which provide usage rights for specific applications 
fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus  in some cases  royalties 
finally  our professional services teams typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project 
proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work 
however  third parties may develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future 
under our customer agreements and other license agreements  in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
for example  we are currently 
table of contents defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense 
these types of claims can result in costly and time consuming litigation  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products  require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
employees as of november   synopsys had  employees  of whom  were based in north america and  were based outside of north america

we have experienced no work stoppages  and we believe our employee relations are good

item legal proceedings synopsys is currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business
