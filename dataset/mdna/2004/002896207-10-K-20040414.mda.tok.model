critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
since actual results may differ from those estimates  the company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements see note 
the company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for  primarily with either cash or credit card 
catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise 
amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the direct shipping costs are classified as cost of goods sold 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
the company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
inventory valuation inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  utilizing the retail method 
the retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory 
at the company  the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit sku level by averaging all costs for each sku 
an initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship 
the use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed 
markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines 
additionally  as part of inventory valuation  an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory 
property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis  using service lives ranging principally from years for buildings  to years for leasehold improvements and to years for other property and equipment 
beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the purchase of the abercrombie fitch business by the limited  inc now known as limited brands  inc  the limited and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized 
long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable 
factors used in the evaluation include  but are not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the company s operations 
significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs  income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
the effective tax rate utilized by the company reflects management s judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions 
contingencies in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments may be required
