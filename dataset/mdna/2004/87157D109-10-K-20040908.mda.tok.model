item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors that may affect results you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed user interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing  communications  entertainment  and other electronic devices 
from our inception in through  we were a development stage company  which focused on developing and refining our pattern recognition and capacitive sensing technologies  and generated revenue by providing contract engineering and design services 
in fiscal  we began shipping our proprietary touchpad and are now the world s leading supplier of interface solutions to the notebook computer market and the hdd portable digital music player market 
we estimate our market share to be greater than for both notebook computers and hdd portable digital music players for fiscal we believe our market share results from the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to design products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
in april  we began shipping our initial dual pointing solution for notebook computers  which included third party products  that enabled pc oems to offer end users the combination of both a touch pad and a pointing stick 
in january  we achieved our first design win incorporating our proprietary pointing stick solution  touchstyk  into a dual pointing application for use in a notebook computer and began shipping them in volume in the december quarter 
with the introduction of our touchstyk  we now offer oems the choice of a touch pad  a pointing stick  or a combination of both of our proprietary interface solutions for dual pointing applications 
demand for our dual pointing solutions results in higher revenue because we are able to sell two interface solutions for each notebook computer 
our initial dual pointing solutions contained a significant percentage of third party products  which we either resell or license 
as a consequence  the gross margin on our dual pointing revenue was initially well below the gross margin we experience from the sale of our proprietary interface solutions and had a significant negative impact on our gross margin in fiscal the combination of the full implementation of our cost improvement programs for our dual pointing solutions containing key third party products  which began in the second half of fiscal  together with our new proprietary dual pointing solutions  which began shipping in december  improved our gross margin in fiscal compared with our gross margin in fiscal we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
through fiscal  we derived all of our product revenue from the 
table of contents notebook computer market 
we began to generate revenue from other markets in fiscal  and revenue from other markets grew to approximately of our total revenue in fiscal while we have been awarded design wins by many of the japanese oems of notebook computers  which are currently ordering and receiving products from us  our largest customers are the major us based oems that sell notebook computers worldwide 
adverse conditions in the notebook computer market or a competitive shift from us to japanese oems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
we work closely with our customers to design interface solutions to meet their specific requirements and provide both pre sale custom design services and post sale support 
during the design phase  we typically do not have any commitment from our customers to pay for our non recurring engineering costs should the customer decide not to introduce that specific product or choose not to incorporate our interface solution in its products 
we believe our focus on customer service and support has allowed us to develop strong customer relationships in the pc market  which we plan to expand in the future  and has provided us with the experience necessary to develop strong customer relationships in the new markets we intend to penetrate 
in june  we acquired nsm technology limited  or nsm  a hong kong company 
the acquisition of nsm provided us with a highly skilled and experienced work force to expand our global presence and infrastructure to support customers in the asia pacific region 
many of our customers are migrating their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and our oem customers are beginning to establish design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  including offices in taiwan  hong kong  and china  we are better positioned to provide local sales  operations  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  within the asia pacific region 
our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our manufacturing subcontractors to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our manufacturing subcontractors with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
however  we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our manufacturing subcontractors 
currently  we use two third party manufacturers to provide our proprietary capacitive based asics  and in certain cases  we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  manufacturing  and assembly costs paid to third party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  all warranty costs and any inventory provisions or write downs are charged to cost of revenue 
our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and our ongoing cost improvement programs 
in fiscal  we experienced significant pressure on our gross margin  resulting from the increasing revenue mix of dual pointing solutions containing significant third party products 
we have been successful in implementing cost reductions that have greatly improved the gross margins of these dual pointing solutions 
these cost improvement programs include reducing component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
in addition  our gross margin has been positively impacted by shipments of our proprietary dual pointing solutions  which began shipping in volume in our december quarter 
in the future  we plan to introduce additional new products  which may initially negatively impact our gross margin  as was the case with our dual pointing solutions 
our research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering  materials costs  patent expenses  and the costs incurred to design interface solutions for customers prior to the customers commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain a leadership position in our existing markets and to develop new technologies for new markets 
in fiscal  we significantly increased our research and development expenses as a result of our october acquisition of absolute sensors limited  or asl  a company located in cambridge  united kingdom  which has been developing inductive pen sensing technology applicable to new markets we intend to address 
also related to this acquisition was the write off in fiscal of acquired in process research and development of  and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to this acquisition totaled  in fiscal as the result of the july  adoption of statement of 
table of contents financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we ceased amortizing goodwill and accordingly only recorded amortization of other intangible assets of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other intangible assets were fully amortized as of the end of fiscal  thus  we recorded no amortization of intangible assets in fiscal the carrying value of the remaining goodwill will be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting increased staffing  commission expense associated with higher revenue levels  and additional management personnel in anticipation of our continued growth in our existing markets and penetration into new markets 
in october  we began replacing outside sales representatives with inside sales personnel for certain customer accounts to facilitate a closer working relationship with those customers 
we continue to utilize both inside sales personnel and outside sales representatives and agents 
in fiscal and  we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the june acquisition of the employees of a former taiwanese sales agent of  and  respectively 
these assets were fully amortized as of june  in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million through fiscal  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
options granted are typically subject to a four year vesting period 
restricted stock acquired through the exercise of unvested stock options is subject to our right to repurchase the unvested stock at the price paid  which right to repurchase lapses over the vesting period 
we also recorded million of deferred compensation related to options granted to consultants through fiscal we are amortizing the deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options and the repurchase periods for the restricted stock 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
the remaining unamortized balance of deferred stock compensation is  of which we expect to record amortization expense of approximately  in fiscal and the balance in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  income taxes  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances at the time we recognize revenue  which is typically upon shipment  based on historical experience 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned as the services are provided under the terms of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s potential inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due 
in addition  we must make judgments and estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables based on our historical bad debt experience  customers creditworthiness  current economic trends  recent changes in customer payment trends  and deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position 
if circumstances change adversely  additional bad debt allowances may be required 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories is based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand  rapid product improvements  or technological changes  or any of them  can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to an economic downturn  rapid product improvements and technological changes  and termination or changes by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
periodically when a customer s delivery schedule is delayed or a customer s order is cancelled  we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers 
in those circumstances in which we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers and our customer has cancelled its order  we consider a write down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value 
product warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  materials usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we exercise judgment in determining the estimates underlying our accrued warranty liability 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if the actual rate of unit failure is greater than what we used in estimating the accrued warranty liability 
income taxes we recognize federal  state  and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state  and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed  which could impact income tax expense 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue 
years ended june  net revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general  and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets amortization of deferred stock compensation restructuring total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  net revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june   an increase of 
the net increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a more than increase in unit shipments  partially offset by a reduction in overall average unit selling price resulting from a change in product mix and general competitive pricing 
net revenue from dual pointing applications declined to of total net revenue for the year ended june  compared with of total net revenue for the year ended june  the decrease in net revenue from dual pointing applications reflected the continuing shift toward single pointing solutions  driven by the combination of consumer and small business demand for low priced notebook computers and the impact of competitive solutions in the dual pointing segment of the notebook market 
our non pc revenue grew to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june   primarily driven by increased demand for portable digital entertainment devices that utilize our capacitive interface solutions 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended june   unchanged from the for the year ended june  gross margin as a percentage of revenue was unchanged as the impact of ongoing competitive pricing pressures resulting in lower average selling prices were offset by lower manufacturing costs  driven by the combination of our continuing design and process improvement programs and lower materials and assembly costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to from  while spending on research and development activities increased to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development spending reflects higher employee compensation costs from increased staffing  our annual performance review process and incentive pay programs  project related expenses  and to a lesser extent  higher patent related expenses  partially offset by lower consulting costs and depreciation charges 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to from  while spending on selling  general  and administrative activities increased to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative spending was attributable to higher compensation costs associated 
table of contents with our annual review process and incentive pay programs  including higher commission expense on higher net revenue  additional expenses related to compliance with new sec regulations  tax advisory services  and generally higher operating levels 
amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
in prior years  amortization of other intangible assets related to our october acquisition of asl  a company located in cambridge  united kingdom 
as of june   these other intangible assets were fully amortized 
accordingly  no amortization of other intangible assets was recorded for the year ended june  for the year ended june   we recorded  of amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the year ended june  included amortization expense for deferred stock compensation of  compared with  for the year ended june  the remaining unamortized balance of deferred stock compensation is  of which we expect to record amortization expense of approximately  in fiscal and the balance in future years 
restructuring 
in late june  we completed the acquisition of nsm 
in connection with the acquisition of nsm  duplicate operational positions were identified at our san jose and taiwan locations  resulting in a  restructuring charge  consisting primarily of severance costs for terminated employees which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal operating income 
we generated operating income of million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  as discussed in the preceding paragraphs  the improvement in operating income was primarily a result of the increase in revenue coupled with a reduction of research and development expenses and selling  general  and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue 
net interest income 
net interest income was  for the year ended june  compared with  for the year ended june   resulting from generally lower interest rates partially offset by the benefit of higher average cash balances 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million compared with million for the year ended june   reflecting the higher pre tax profit levels 
the income tax provision represents estimated federal and state taxes and foreign taxes associated with our operations in the united kingdom  taiwan  and japan for the years ended june  and  and the addition of hong kong for the year ended june  the effective tax rates for the years ended june  and june  were and  respectively  and represent a lower percentage than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest income 
fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  net revenue 
revenue for the year ended june  was million  which was essentially flat with the million of revenue for the year ended june  unit shipments increased approximately year over year but were mostly offset by a change in product mix from dual to single pointing solutions  general competitive pricing pressure  and lower non recurring engineering and patent license fees 
while we experienced increases in revenue from our single pointing products and non pc products  revenue from dual pointing products declined 
revenue from our dual pointing applications was approximately of our revenue for the year ended june  compared with for the year ended june  revenue growth was impacted by lower overall average selling prices resulting from both the mix change and competitive pricing pressure 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended june  compared with for the year ended june  the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from cost reductions and changes in product mix  partially offset by general competitive pricing pressures 
during fiscal  our ongoing cost improvement programs resulted in manufacturing efficiencies gained from design and process improvements and lower materials and assembly costs 
increased sales 
table of contents of our proprietary dual pointing solutions  which have higher gross margin than dual pointing solutions using third party products  also contributed to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to from and spending on research and development activities increased to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the major contributors to the increased research and development spending were costs associated with our higher staffing levels  including compensation and facilities related costs  higher product development activities  which included outside services  and material costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to from and spending on selling  general  and administrative activities increased to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative spending resulted principally from higher compensation costs associated with increased staffing levels  generally higher operating levels  and additional costs related to our status as a public reporting company  partially offset by lower commissions  primarily resulting from the replacement of outside sales representatives with inside sales personnel for certain customer accounts that we implemented in october amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets was related to our october acquisition of asl  a company located in cambridge  united kingdom 
for the year ended june   we recorded amortization of  compared with  for the year ended june  as of june   these other intangible assets were fully amortized 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the year ended june  included amortization expense for deferred stock compensation of  compared with  for the year ended june  operating income 
we generated operating income of million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  as discussed in preceding paragraphs  the reduction in operating income was primarily a result of the increase in research and development and selling  general  and administrative spending  partially offset by an improvement in gross margins on essentially flat revenue 
net interest income 
net interest income was  for the year ended june  compared with  for the year ended june  the increase in net interest income reflected higher interest income from higher cash balances  resulting primarily from the investment of our initial public offering proceeds  cash flow from operations  and lower interest expense associated with equipment lease financing arrangements  partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on invested cash 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million compared with million for the year ended june   reflecting the lower pre tax profit levels  partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate 
the income tax provision represents the estimated federal and state taxes and the foreign taxes associated with our operations in the united kingdom  taiwan  and japan 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was approximately  which is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of research and development tax credits

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  which is predicated on capital preservation and consists primarily of government backed securities and investment grade instruments  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june  in thousands fiscal year ended june  thereafter total fair value assets cash equivalents variable rate amounts average rate short term investments variable rate amounts average rate liabilities capital leases and equipment financing obligations fixed rate amounts average rate note payable to related party fixed rate amounts average rate there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our investment portfolio and debt obligations subsequent to june  foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenue  cost of revenue  and expenses  except those expenses related to our asia pacific and european operations  are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been immaterial to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we feel that our foreign exchange exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk
