in accordance with the merger agreement  the company issued  after giving effect to a for reverse stock split shares of its common stock and  shares of a newly issued non voting preferred stock in exchange for all the outstanding voting stock of rotonics 
the preferred stock was completely redeemed prior to the end of fiscal  and the company s articles of incorporation were subsequently amended to eliminate the authorization of series a preferred stock

the wisconsin facility is currently being leased to one tenant on a month to month term basis at  per month 
in february  the company purchased a acre facility consisting of  square feet of manufacturing and office building space in commerce city  colorado 
the company has since expended significant resources to refurbish the facility to house its colorado operations 
the facility is also located within an enterprise zone  which continues to provide additional benefits 
the company leases a portion of this facility s excess office and yard space on a long term basis at  per month 
effective april   the company merged with rotocast international  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries rotocast  with the company being the surviving entity 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the company issued  shares of its common stock and a  note payable secured by a stand by letter of credit  in exchange for all the outstanding voting stock of rotocast 
in january  the company repurchased these shares for million 
upon consummation of the repurchase  the shares were retired 
rotocast had operations in miami  florida  knoxville  tennessee  brownwood  texas  las vegas  nevada  and bossier city  louisiana 
these operations currently conduct business as divisions of the company using the trade names nutron  rotocast of tennessee  rmi b and rmi nevada 
prior to the merger  the operations in bossier city  louisiana were substantially discontinued 
rotocast was a privately held florida corporation  owned by gsc industries  inc gsc 
the company leases the remaining rotocast facilities from gsc  and other affiliated parties  under long term lease arrangements 
a portion of the nutron office building is being sub leased on a long term basis at  per month 
in conjunction with the rotocast merger  the company initiated the consolidation of its warminster  pennsylvania and arleta  california facilities into its remaining operations 
the consolidation of these facilities was completed in fiscal and enhanced the operations of the company s remaining facilities  reduced its overall manufacturing overhead costs  and allowed the company to take greater advantage of its marketing and distribution channels 
also  in fiscal  the company consolidated its miami operations into the remaining operating facilities 
the corporate office of the company is located at the same site as the rmi g gardena  california facility 
description of business the company currently has ten manufacturing locations and was again listed by a plastics industry periodical as one of the top ten rotational molders in north america 
these operating divisions manufacture a variety of plastic products for commercial  agricultural  pharmaceutical  governmental  building  medical waste  refuse  retail  recreation  marine  healthcare and residential use  as well as a vast number of custom plastic products for a variety of industries  utilizing the rotonically molding process and  on a smaller scale  injection molding and dip molding processes 
in april  the injection molding process was added to the company s manufacturing operations as part of the rotocast merger 
utilizing this process  the company markets a variety of parts for commercial  promotional  and residential uses  under the trade names nutron and amp 
rotonically molding is a process for molding plastic resin by rotating a mold in a heated environment  while the plastic resin powder placed inside the mold melts and evenly coats the inner wall of the mold 
the injection molding process varies in that the plastic resin is first heated to a molten state and then injected under pressure into a mold 
the rotonically molding process has been used for many years and continues to be recognized as a growth industry in recent years  as a result of numerous ongoing business consolidations and the development of new resins 
these new resins allow rotonically molded items to compete with more traditional materials such as carbon  fiberglass  and stainless steel  especially in the fabrication of large  lightweight  one piece molded items  such as storage tanks and polysteel light poles 
rotonically molding is a particularly advantageous process for users of molded plastic products who may want to test different prototypes  or who do not require sufficient numbers of such products to justify a more expensive manufacturing process 
the company s products include various types of storage tanks  bin lids  refuse containers for automated removal  medical waste containers  agricultural livestock products  kayaks  outdoor polysteel lamp posts  furniture  planters  and other rotonically molded items 
the company purchases resin from six major suppliers in the us and canada 
there are fifteen additional suppliers of lesser significance 
since the majority of the resin used in the manufacturing process is a polyethylene derived from natural gas  resin price is not directly related to the price for petrochemicals  and until recent years  has not generally been subject to volatile fluctuations that are often experienced by the petroleum industry 
the company also incorporates the use of recycled plastic materials  blended with virgin materials in the manufacturing of products  whenever appropriate 
the company holds several patents on storage containers used for pharmaceutical  commercial and residential applications that expire through the year although the company has been able to capture its share of these niche markets and expects to see continued growth  no one patent or groups of patents is considered material to the business as a whole 
competition for the company s products is governed by geography and region  since large capacity tanks and bulky hollow products are expensive to ship long distances and  as such  any prospective competitor is constrained by shipping costs 
there are numerous single location  as well as a growing trend to structure multi location  rotonically molding businesses throughout the united states 
however  each of these businesses still competes in a geographic region  which is determined by customer demand within that region  a constraint inherent to the industry 
due to its nationwide presence  the company has substantially alleviated this constraint 
the company s sales are usually not subject to large seasonal fluctuations as the business typically operates on significant backlogs with a diverse product mix 
peak season is usually experienced in the period from april through june 
historically  the quarter from january through march is the slowest production period of the year 
the company s backlog was  and  as of june  and  respectively 
all of the backlog orders as of june  are expected to be filled during fiscal the company s products are marketed through the in house sales and engineering staff  various distributors and outside commission based sales representatives 
the company continues to build a strong  broad and diverse customer base  which covers a multitude of industries 
since fiscal  no sales to any one single customer represented a material part of the company s business 
research and development expenditures for the company were insignificant for the last three fiscal years 
regulation the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  and does not anticipate any such laws will have material effect on its financial position  capital expenditures  or competitive position 
employees as of june   the company employed a total of individuals 
the company maintains  for its respective employees who are eligible  a medical insurance plan some of which is contributory  a group life insurance plan  an annual bonus plan and a semi annual attendance bonus plan

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction to the extent that this k annual report discusses matters which are not historical  including statements regarding future financial results  information  or expectation about products or markets  or otherwise makes statements about future events  such statements are forward looking and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these include  among others  fluctuations in costs of raw materials and other expenses  costs associated with plant closures  downturns in the markets served by the company  the costs associated with new product introductions  as well as other factors described under the heading item  business  item  legal proceedings  under this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and footnote to financial statements 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our opinion only as of the date of the annual report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements after the date of this document 
you should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us in fiscal operations net sales improved by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the majority of our product groups reflected improvements with the most notable being a increase in refuse products  a increase in contract manufacturing products and a increase in industrial products 
we were pleased to realize such a notable upturn in sales volumes 
during fiscal  we spent  on new equipment  tooling and improvements to further our commitment to increase our sales  improve productivity and continue to improve the quality of our product offerings 
we have met this goal this year and will continue to benefit from these improvements and new product offerings for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we have similar capital expenditure plans slated for fiscal that should further our drive to improve future sales 
we also remain optimistic that our marketplace will continue to strengthen and in turn will provide additional opportunities for growth 
net sales fell to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal fiscal sales volumes continued to mirror our nation s lackluster economy 
our industrial product group reflected the most resilience during these tough conditions  reporting a modest increase in sales 
of the hardest hit sectors  our contract manufacturing group was down in fiscal however  fiscal was also a strong period for contract tooling projects that are expected to help boost future contract manufacturing sales 
we were also in the final stages of placing our state of the art new roto molding machine into service  which will improve our competitive edge in the marketplace 
cost of goods sold was  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  and  or and of net sales  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our sales volumes along with our manufacturing efficiencies and systematic price increases helped mitigate the overall increase material costs along with rising natural gas and workers compensation insurance costs that amounted to approximately  these costs coupled with a  inventory write down in fiscal  ultimately reduced our gross margins by 
we do not foresee any significant relief from these costs  but will remain vigilant in our efforts to offset these rising costs in future periods 
selling general and administrative sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal overall sg a costs decreased  which is primarily attributed to the  one time administrative contractual charge incurred in fiscal we are pleased that we have been able to maintain overall sg a costs in line with current sales volume levels and anticipate holding this trend in the ensuing year 
sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal overall sg a costs have decreased  which is primarily attributed to our cost containment efforts 
these efforts were reflected in reduced marketing costs of  travel costs of  and wage benefit costs of  additional cost savings were also reflected in commission royalty expenses of  due to royalty agreements completed in fiscal and a dip in commission based product sales  and finally  a reduction in bad debt expense of  these costs savings were reduced by a  one time administrative contractual charge during fiscal income from operations was  or of net sales  in fiscal year compared to  and  or and of net sales  in fiscal and  respectively 
we are pleased that our commitment to improving year on year operating results is starting to pay off in spite of ongoing increases in insurance  utility and raw material costs as previously mentioned and we anticipate future improvements 
in addition  fiscal income from operations also benefited from the overall reduction in sg a costs as also outlined above 
the reduction in operating income in fiscal was attributed to the reduction in sales volumes coupled with the increase in cost of goods sold again attributed to unmitigated increases in workers compensation insurance  utilities and raw materials incurred during the period 
total interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  and  in fiscal and respectively 
the decrease is due to the historically low interest rates that we continued to benefit from during the current year along with a more favorable debt structure 
although we anticipate our debt structure to remain fairly consistent in the ensuing months  recent increases in the bank s prime and libor rates may increase future interest costs 
the notable decrease in interest costs during fiscal was attributed to the  reduction in our debt structure during fiscal coupled with more favorable bank interest rates 
income taxes were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
current federal taxes amounted to  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  a notable portion of our tax provision was the deferred tax component  which amounted to  during fiscal this amount was primarily related to the federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward and state net operating loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  we fully utilized our  federal amt credit carry forward 
following the utilization of our amt credit carryforward  we have incurred an increase in our current federal taxes 
fiscal increase income tax expense is also related to the increase in income before taxes compared to fiscal net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill increased  to  or 
per common share  for fiscal compared to  or 
per common share  in fiscal the second half of fiscal offered a renewed vigor in the marketplace  that coupled with our efforts to improve sales volumes through enhanced product offerings and productivity resulted in our increase in fiscal sales volumes 
the significant increase in sales volumes provided the needed base to mitigate the rising raw material  utility and insurance costs that continue to challenge our operations  along with the  fiscal inventory write down 
we successfully recouped a portion of these costs  which coupled with the reduction in sg a and interest costs provided the increase in current years net income 
even though it seems evident that raw materials  natural gas and insurance costs will continue to challenge future periods  we remain optimistic that our strong financial condition and business strategies will help us to respond to current market conditions and allow us to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise 
net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill decreased  to  or 
per common share  for fiscal compared to  or 
per common share  in fiscal although we believe that future market conditions are slowly improving  fiscal was hampered by a sluggish economy  especially in the fourth quarter  which contributed to the drop in sales volumes 
while our cost containment efforts  as reflected in the  reduction in sg a costs  along with lower interest costs  helped to preserve income levels  we still were unable to fully compensate for rising raw material  insurance and utility costs 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill we recorded an adjustment effective july  to reflect the impact of adopting sfas no  amounting to a reduction of intangible assets of  this amount is reflected in net loss for the fiscal year ended june  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill 
the adjustment represents a write down of our net goodwill based on a review of the goodwill for impairment 
under the assessment guidelines of sfas no 
and the sec s guidance that our quoted market price is the most efficient mechanism for estimating fair value  it was determined the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
although the assumptions used to estimate fair value may not be indicative of future results  our goodwill has been reduced to zero and will not require future impairment analysis 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased  to  at june   compared to  at june  the increase is related to the  increase in accounts receivable and inventories consistent with the increase in sales volumes during the current year net of the related increase in accounts payable of  primarily related to the purchase of raw materials again associated with the higher sales volumes and to take advantage of favorable resin pricing 
cash flows from operations decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  for the same period last year 
the decrease is once again attributed to the significant build up in our accounts receivable balance due to the  increase in sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal when compared to the same period last year 
we expended  for property  plant and equipment pp e in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal costs incurred during the current period are related to the completion of our new state of the art roto molding machine that was placed in service at our commerce city  colorado facility and the costs associated with a new roto molding machine installed at our gainesville  texas facility 
the remaining costs incurred are related to new tooling and tooling modifications that we believe enhanced our competitive edge in the market place and in turn helped spur the improved sales volumes in fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures to total approximately million in fiscal that will include the instillation of three new roto molding machines 
net borrowings under the line of credit increased  to  between june  and june  the increase is due to the timing of payments for capital expenditures  raw materials  federal income taxes and common stock repurchases during the year 
due to the timing of such payments  as well as the current build up in accounts receivable  it is not unusual to incur fluctuations in our line of credit borrowings throughout the year 
however  since june   our total debt borrowings have only risen  as a result of these cash outlays 
we anticipate that this trend will continue through fiscal as we balance the timing of cash flows from operations and the funding of these type or cash outlays 
effective october   the bank extended the maturity date on the line of credit to october  in addition  we did not advance on the  term loan commitment that subsequently expired on october  and was not renewed 
all other terms and conditions surrounding our credit facility with the bank remained the same  except that the agreement was also modified to expand our ability to issue letters of credit 
the following is a summary of the company s contractual commitments associated with its debt and lease obligations as of june  for the year ended june  thereafter total principal payments term debt line of credit operating leases total commitments during fiscal  we reinstated our common stock buyback program 
in fiscal  we acquired  shares of common stock at a total cost of  as of june   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
on june   the board declared a dividend of 
per share of common stock payable on july  to stockholders of record on july  this marks the eighth payment of dividends since on our common stock 
the board is committed to annually review a dividend program for our common stock 
cash flows from operations in conjunction with our revolving line of credit are expected to meet our needs for working capital  capital expenditures  common stock repurchases and repayment of long term debt for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen 
fin  as revised  clarifies existing accounting literature regarding the consolidation of entities in which a company holds a controlling financial interest 
a majority voting interest in an entity has generally been considered indicative of a controlling financial interest 
fin specifies other factors variable interest which must be considered when determining whether a company holds controlling financial interest in  and therefore must consolidate  an entity variable interest entities 
the adoption of fin had no impact on the company s overall financial position and results of operations as the company has no variable interest entities 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to sfas no 
in its entirety  or as hybrid instrument with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features 
in addition  sfas no 
clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to derivatives 
this statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
was adopted by the company on july  and did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements 
certain financial and operating restrictions under these agreements are fully disclosed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we make various estimates when applying accounting policies in accordance with gaap that affect our consolidated financial statements 
due to the nature of our business  these estimates generally are not considered highly uncertain at the time of estimation and therefore are not expected to result in a period to period change that would materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we do apply key accounting principles as required by gaap 
these key accounting policies govern accounts receivable  inventory valuation and income taxes 
accounts receivable we make judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are based on a percentage of net sales and a specific review of all significant outstanding receivable balances 
percentages applied may vary based on analysis of historical collection experience or current economic trends 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the results of operations could be affected 
inventory valuation finished goods inventory is valued at cost and management uses historical gross margin trends and other estimates to continually update labor and overhead allocations 
the gross margin percentage reflects our estimate of the cost of  among other things  material  labor and overhead expenditures during the production process 
such costs are capitalized to inventory as products are manufactured 
although it is believed that the estimates are reasonable  it is possible that the actual labor and overhead costs will differ over time from the estimated amounts 
due to the high volume of transactions and the way raw materials are used in product manufacturing  inventory quantities can change rapidly and are impacted by a variety of factors including  production efficiency  obsolescence  scrap  design changes  customer preferences  etc 
as such  the company must regularly count inventories to ensure they are up to date 
the company takes a physical count monthly and reconciles the count to the inventory 
however  given the number of transactions  the number of locations and the large number of inventory items  adjustments to the counts do occur on a regular basis 
although we believe that our inventory counts and values are reasonable the inventory does have some inherit estimates that could impact our balance sheet and results of operations 
income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on the current amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes 
we base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases expectations about future outcomes 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates 
our net operating loss carryforwards  which are available to offset taxable income  are also subject to limitations should a change in ownership as defined in the internal revenue code occur 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in particular  we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income for the period in which such determination is made 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing economic environment that presents numerous risks 
many of these risks are beyond our control and are driven by factors that we cannot predict 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
economic  political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth 
our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for plastic products for commercial  recreational and residential uses 
because our sales are primarily to corporate and government customers  our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
the general weakening of the global economy  the weakening of business conditions in the manufacturing industry  and governmental budgetary constraints have resulted in a decreased demand for our products as we realized during the first half of fiscal if demand for our products weakens again  our revenue growth rates will be adversely affected 
in addition  our country s war on terrorism  as well as federal and state budgetary concerns  have contributed to economic  political and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations 
if economic and market conditions do not remain healthy  our business will be adversely affected 
management has no comparative advantage in forecasting macroeconomic trends and developments relating to general business conditions 
our management is  however  required to make such forecasts in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are in error  because we are either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or of a sector  our performance can suffer because of a failure properly to match corporate strategy with economic conditions 
if we do not successfully manage our operating margins  our business can be negatively impacted 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to forecast revenues accurately and control expenses 
while we can control certain internal factors  our future operating results can be adversely impacted by external factors  such as a slowing in demand for certain of our products 
if there is an unexpected decline in revenues  which is not offset by a decrease in expenses  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
we may be required to change our business practices if there are changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies 
policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  income taxes  facilities consolidation  accounting for acquisitions  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments as to complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under re examination by accounting standards groups and regulators 
these standard groups and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse  changes to our accounting policies 
business disruptions could affect our future operating results 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event  such as terrorist attacks upon the united states 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in  california experienced ongoing power shortages  which resulted in rolling blackouts 
these blackouts  blackouts in other regions or procedures implemented to avert blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of our customers 
such disruptions  particularly at the end of a quarter  could adversely affect quarterly revenues and net income 
our stock price could remain volatile and your investment could lose value 
our stock price has fluctuated widely in the past and could continue to do so in the future
