item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report on form k 
the discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements include the statements below under risk factors 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below under risk factors 
overview introgen therapeutics  inc was incorporated in delaware in we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
we are developing product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers using non integrating gene agents 
these agents are designed to increase production of normal cancer fighting proteins that act to overpower cancerous cells 
our lead product candidate  advexin therapy  combines the p gene with a non replicating  non integrating adenoviral gene delivery system that we have developed and extensively tested 
the p gene is one of the most potent members of a group of naturally occurring tumor suppressor genes  which act to kill cancer cells  arrest cancer cell growth and protect cells from becoming cancerous 
in order to commercialize our product candidates  we must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete clinical trials demonstrating that our product candidates are safe and effective for a particular cancer type or other disease 
since our inception in  we have used our resources primarily to conduct research and development activities for advexin therapy and  to a lesser extent  for other product candidates 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future that may be greater than losses incurred in prior periods 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for operating activities 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses and losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities increase  and as we expand our operations and develop systems to support commercialization of our product candidates  these losses  among other things  have caused and may cause our stockholders equity and working capital to decrease 
currently  we earn revenue or income from federal research grants  contract services and process development activities  the lease of a portion of our facilities to m 
d 
anderson cancer center and interest income on cash placed in short term  investment grade securities 
in order to fund our operating losses  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
in october  we entered into two collaboration agreements with rh ne poulenc rorer pharmaceuticals inc  which ultimately became part of aventis pharma  or aventis  for technology relating to p and k ras pathway inhibition 
aventis funded the clinical trials under these programs 
in june  we and aventis restructured our relationship whereby we assumed responsibility for the worldwide development of all p and k ras products  including funding  control and performance of ongoing clinical trials 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million to selected institutional investors through a private placement pursuant to regulation d promulgated under the securities act of  as amended 
our net proceeds from this transaction  after related fees and expenses  were million 
in connection with this sale  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
these warrants are exercisable at any time by the warrant holders through june beginning in june  we may force the exercise of these warrants if the 
table of contents average closing market price of our common stock during any consecutive trading days is greater than per share 
the shares of common stock issued and issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued in this transaction were registered on a registration statement on form s  effective august  commission file no 

in december  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in a direct equity offering pursuant to a shelf registration for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
our net proceeds from this transaction  after related fees and expenses  were approximately million 
the shares of common stock issued in this transaction were registered pursuant to a registration statement on form s  effective august  commission file no 
registering shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of million 
we may sell additional shares of our common stock pursuant to this registration statement in the future 
summary of significant accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents include investments in short term  investment grade securities  which currently consist primarily of united states federal government obligations 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
at any point in time  amortized costs may be greater or less than fair value 
if investments are sold prior to maturity  we could incur a realized gain or loss based on the fair market value of the investments at the date of sale 
we could incur future losses on investments if the investment issuer becomes impaired or the investment is downgraded 
research and development costs 
in conducting our clinical trials of advexin therapy and other product candidates  we procure services from numerous third party vendors 
the cost of these services constitutes a significant portion of the cost of these trials and of our research and development expenses in general 
these vendors do not necessarily provide us billings for their services on a regular basis and  accordingly  are often not a timely source of information to determine the costs we have incurred relative to their services for any given accounting period 
as a result  we make significant accounting estimates as to the amount of costs we have incurred relative to these vendors in each accounting period 
these estimates are based on numerous factors  including  among others  costs set forth in our contracts with these vendors  the period of time over which the vendor will render the services and the rate of enrollment of patients in our clinical trials 
using these estimates  we record expenses and accrued liabilities in each accounting period that we believe fairly represent our obligations to these vendors 
actual results could differ from these estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the amount of expense recorded and the related accrual 
our experience has been that our estimates have reasonably reflected the expenses we actually incur 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues contract services  grant and other revenue 
we earn contract services revenues from third parties under agreements to provide manufacturing process development services and to produce products for them 
we earned contract research services revenue from aventis pharmaceuticals products  inc  one of our stockholders  under an agreement through which aventis provided funding for the conduct of a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy in breast cancer 
we earn grant revenue under research grants from us government agencies 
total contract services  grant and other revenue was  in and million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the level of our contract manufacturing activity due to the completion of work under services agreements with certain third 
table of contents parties during  which was not replaced with new contract manufacturing work due to our focus during on the preparation of regulatory filings for advexin therapy and development of our other product candidates  and a decrease in contract services revenue earned from aventis as the initial portion of the phase clinical trial of advexin therapy in breast cancer approached completion 
costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in this expense included compensation related to the issuance of stock options of  in and  in this decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to cost control programs implemented during that reduced the rate at which we used cash for operations

general and administrative expenses were million in and were million in this expense included compensation related to the issuance of stock options of million in and  in this decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to cost control programs implemented during that reduced the rate at which we used cash for operations 
compensation related to the issuance of stock options 
compensation related to the issuance of stock options was million in and million in even though compensation expense related to certain stock options granted in previous periods declined due to deferred compensation related to those stock options becoming fully amortized during  total stock option compensation expense was relatively unchanged between years due to stock options granted in to certain members of our board of directors for which some of the options have exercise prices below the market value of our common stock at the date of grant and were fully vested upon issuance  and our corporate secretary  who is not a director or employee and for whom options grants are subject to fair value accounting 
the amount of compensation expense related to stock options to be recorded in future periods may increase if additional options are issued at a price below the market price of common stock at the date of grant or are issued to individuals or entities other than employees or directors and may decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently forfeited or as previously recorded deferred compensation becomes fully amortized 
interest income  interest expense and other income interest income was million in compared to  in  an increase of 
included in the amount is  we received from the settlement of litigation related to a decline in the market value of certain commercial paper we held as an investment in and excluding the amount from this settlement  interest income for was  which decreased compared to interest income for  due to our lower average cash and cash equivalents balances during and declining interest rates 
interest expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of lower principal amounts upon which interest was incurred in compared to as a result of continuing debt service payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations

this revenue was million in and  in this increase was due to a higher level of manufacturing and process development contract services activity for third parties in compared to and funding received from aventis in to support a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy in breast cancer 

table of contents costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in and million in this expense included amortization of deferred stock compensation of  in and  in this increase in research and development expense was primarily due to our assumption in the third quarter of and thereafter of responsibility for conducting  managing and funding the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin therapy under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in and million in this expense included amortization of deferred stock compensation of  in and million in this increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to the additional cost of providing administrative support for our conduct and management of the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin therapy  the responsibility for which we assumed in the third quarter of under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
amortization of deferred compensation

comparison of six month periods ended december  and unaudited revenues revenue from collaborations 
collaborative research and development revenues from aventis were zero for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in our not receiving payments from aventis subsequent to december  for early stage research and development related to p based gene therapy products 
prior to this restructuring  we earned revenue for the early stage research and development we performed under our collaboration agreements with aventis 
revenue from product sales to affiliate 
revenues from product sales to aventis were zero for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in no product sales subsequent to december  the restructuring eliminated our product sales to aventis since we are using the product internally for the future development of advexin therapy 
other revenue 
other revenue was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to a decline in amounts earned under research grants from us government agencies and contract manufacturing work for third parties 
costs and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was zero for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to the 
table of contents restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in no product sales subsequent to december   thereby eliminating our cost of product sales

research and development expenses were million for the six month period ended december   and million for the six month period ended december  this expense included amortization of deferred stock compensation of  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to our assumption of responsibility for conducting  managing and funding the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin therapy under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in and million in this expense included amortization of deferred stock compensation of  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase in general and administrative expense in was due primarily to the additional  ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company  subsequent to our initial public offering in october  and the cost of providing administrative support for our conduct and management of the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin therapy  the responsibility for which we assumed under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
amortization of deferred compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase in was due primarily to deferred compensation arising from the issuance to an officer in april of an option to purchase shares of our common stock 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances in on which interest was earned as a result of our initial public offering in october interest expense was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher balances under notes payable in compared to as a result of borrowings to finance tenant improvements to our facility related to our sublease of space to m

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since our inception  and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
from inception through december   we have financed our operations using million of collaborative research and development payments from aventis  million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in october  million of private equity sales to aventis  million of private equity sales  net of offering costs  to others including million from the private sale of our common stock in june  million of equity sales in a registered direct offering under a shelf registration in december  million of sales of advexin therapy product to aventis for use in later stage clinical trials  million in mortgage financing from banks for our facilities  million in leases from commercial leasing companies to acquire equipment pledged as collateral for those leases and million from contract services  grants  interest and other income 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared with million at december  this increase was primarily a result of the use of million of cash to fund our operations offset by the sale of million shares of our common stock in june and december for net proceeds of million 
for at least the next two years  we expect to focus our activities primarily on 
table of contents conducting phase and other clinical trials  conducting data analysis  preparing regulatory documentation submissions to the fda and conducting pre marketing activities for advexin therapy 
we also expect to continue our research and development of various other gene based technologies 
the majority of our expenditures over this two year period will most likely relate to the clinical trials of advexin therapy and the preparation of regulatory filings for advexin therapy 
these activities may increase the rate at which we use cash in the future as compared to the cash we used for operating activities during we believe our existing working capital can fund our operations for the next to months  although unforeseen events could shorten that time period 
our existing resources may not be sufficient to support the commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
in order to fund our operating losses  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in in general  this decrease was primarily due to cost control programs implemented during that reduced the rate at which we used cash for operations 
specifically  the decrease in cash used was primarily the result of a lower net loss in compared to  after considering adjustments for depreciation and compensation related to the issuance of stock options  further affected by a larger decrease in other assets in compared to primarily due to an increased use of previously prepaid expenses to fund operations  a smaller increase in accounts payable in compared to and a decrease in accrued liabilities in compared to an increase in accrued liabilities in  both as a result of cost control programs implemented in resulting in a lower level of obligations to vendors and services providers  and a smaller increase in deferred revenue in compared to due to funding received in for contract manufacturing process development and contract research that was subsequently earned and not replaced by additional funding for similar services 
net cash used in investing activities was  in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the absence of activity related to short term investments in as compared to was due to our not having any short term investments in our purchases of property and equipment in compared to was relatively unchanged as our need for additional property and equipment did not vary significantly between the periods 
while we have no obligations at this time to purchase significant amounts of additional property or equipment  our needs may change 
it may be necessary for us to purchase larger amounts of property and equipment to support our clinical programs and other research  development and manufacturing activities 
we may need to obtain debt or lease financing to facilitate such purchases 
if that financing is not available  we may need to use our existing resources to fund those purchases  which could result in a reduction in the cash and cash equivalents available to fund operating activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in the amount includes million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock in june and million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock in december excluding the proceeds from those sales of common stock  the remaining use of million for financing activities in is lower than the comparable amount for due to the receipt of proceeds under a lease line of credit during for which there was no similar activity in  offset by higher principal payments on notes payable and capital leases as those obligations continue to amortize 
we have an agreement with virrx  inc virrx that began in to purchase  of virrx series a preferred stock on the first day of each quarter through january  we purchased  and  of this stock for cash in and  respectively 
we record these purchases as research and development expense 
virrx is required to use the proceeds from these stock sales in accordance with the terms of a collaboration and license agreement between virrx and us for the development of virrx s technologies 
we may unilaterally terminate this collaboration and license agreement with days prior notice  which would also terminate our requirement to make any additional stock purchases 
provided the collaboration and license agreement remains in place  we are required to make additional milestone stock 
table of contents purchases  either for cash or through the issuance of our common stock  upon the completion of phase  phase and phase clinical trials involving technologies licensed under this agreement and we are required to make a million cash milestone payment to virrx  for which we receive no virrx stock  upon fda approval of a biologics license application involving these technologies 
to the extent we have already made cash milestone payments  we may receive a credit of of the phase clinical trial milestone payments and of the phase clinical trial milestone payments against this million cash milestone payment 
the additional milestone stock purchases and cash payment are not anticipated to be required in the near future 
we have an option to purchase all outstanding shares of virrx at any time until march we have fixed debt service and lease payment obligations under notes payable and capital leases for which the liability is reflected on our balance sheet 
we used the proceeds from these notes payable and leases to finance facilities and equipment 
aggregate payments due under these obligations are as follows in thousands total debt service and lease payments due during the year ending december thereafter total debt service and lease payments less portion representing interest total principal balance at december  principal balance presented on the december  balance sheet as liabilities in these categories current portion of obligations under capital leases and notes payable capital lease obligations  net of current portion notes payable  net of current portion total principal balance at december  we have a fixed rent obligation under a ground lease for the land on which we built our facilities 
since this is an operating lease  there is no liability reflected on our balance sheet for this item  which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we make total annual rent payments of  under this lease which will continue until the expiration of the initial term of this lease in september we have other operating leases expiring in with significantly smaller rent payments that we also account for as operating leases 
future annual rental payments due under all operating leases are as follows in thousands year ending december  thereafter total minimum lease payments under operating leases in the normal course of business  we enter into various long term agreements with vendors to provide services to us 
some of these agreements require up front payment prior to services being rendered  some require periodic monthly payments and some provide for the vendor to bill us for their services as they are 
table of contents rendered 
in substantially all cases  we may cancel these agreements at any time with minimal or no penalty and pay the vendor only for services actually rendered 
regardless of the timing of the payments under these agreements  we record the expenses incurred in the periods in which the services are rendered 
pursuant to a consulting agreement  we pay consulting fees of approximately  per annum to ej financial enterprises  inc  a company owned by the chairman of our board of directors and that formerly employed one of our directors 
ej financial enterprises  inc provides us guidance on strategic product development  business development and marketing activities 
we are obligated to continue paying this fee until we terminate the services of that company at our option

comparison of years ended december  and unaudited at december   we had cash and short term investments of million  compared with million at december  this decrease was primarily a result of the use of cash to fund our operations 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  in general  this increase in cash used was due to our having responsibility for conducting the phase and phase clinical trials for advexin therapy throughout whereas we did not have this responsibility in until june of that year 
specifically  the increase in cash used was primarily the result of a higher net loss in compared to  after considering adjustments for depreciation and compensation related to the issuance of stock options  offset primarily by a decrease in receivables and inventory that was smaller in than in due to the primary activity in these accounts in being related to the restructuring of the aventis collaboration in  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in compared to an increase in these accounts in because the increase included million related to expenses we agreed to pay aventis in connection with the restructuring of the aventis collaboration in  and an increase in deferred revenue in compared to a decrease in this amount in due to a the deferral of the recognition of income under the lease of space to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  which was in effect for the entire period but for only a portion of the period and b a decrease in deferred revenue in relating to the earning of revenue on sales of inventory to aventis  an activity that no longer exists due to the restructuring of the aventis collaboration in june net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change in the amounts of purchases and maturities of short term investments compared to was due to a significant portion of our investment activity in the period being in short term investments  followed by a period subsequent to september   during which we concentrated our investments in cash and cash equivalents  which was then followed in the period by more investments in short term securities 
the costs associated with purchases of property and equipment declined in compared to 
table of contents because included costs related to the completion of tenant improvements to the space leased to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  for which there were no similar costs in net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  this change between periods is due to the period including the receipt of proceeds from the purchase of preferred stock by aventis in connection with the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with them and a note payable used to finance tenant improvements for the lease of space to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  whereas there were no similar events in offsetting these items were higher principal payments under notes payable and capital lease obligations in compared to due to debt service payments on the note payable for tenant improvements being made for all of  but for only a portion of  and a larger portion of debt service payments on all mortgage notes and capital lease obligations applying to principal as the principal balances under these obligations continue to be amortized 
comparison of six month periods ended december  and unaudited at december   we had cash and short term investments of approximately million  compared with million at december  net cash used by operating activities was million and million for the six month period ended december  and the six month period ended december   respectively 
this increase in cash used by operating activities was primarily due to a higher net loss from operations and payment of accrued liabilities  offset partially by a smaller increase in accounts receivable and the absence of a decrease in inventory during as compared to the payment of accrued liabilities was higher due to the increased level of activity associates with our phase clinical trials of advexin therapy 
the smaller increase in accounts receivable and the absence of the decrease in inventory was due to the elimination of sales of advexin therapy to aventis as a result of the restructuring of our collaboration with them 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the six month period ended december   and net cash used in investing activities was million for the six month period ended december  during the six month period ended december   we invested a portion of our cash in short term investments with maturities in excess of days 
during the six month period ended december   we modified our investment policy and concentrated our investing activities in instruments with maturities shorter than days 
this change in policy resulted in a decrease in cash used by investing activities 
we also purchased less property and equipment in the period compared to the period since the period included our activities related to the finish out of a portion of our facilities for lease to m 
d 
anderson cancer center 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decline was primarily due to the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in october being greater than the proceeds from our sale of preferred stock to aventis in july  and a decline in the amount of new notes payable in compared to due to the leasehold improvements related to our sublease of space to m

our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability depends in large part on our ability to commence  execute and complete clinical programs and obtain regulatory approvals for advexin therapy and other drug candidates 
in particular  our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend in large part on our ability to commercialize advexin for the treatment of head and neck cancer in the united states 
we cannot assure you that we will receive approval for advexin for the treatment of head and neck cancer or other types of cancer or indications in the united states or in other countries or if approved that we will achieve significant level of sales 
if we are unable to do so  our business will be harmed 

table of contents if we fail to comply with fda requirements or encounter delays or difficulties in clinical trials for our product candidates  we may not obtain regulatory approval of some or all of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
in order to commercialize our product candidates  we must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete clinical trials demonstrating that our product candidates are safe and effective for a particular cancer type or other disease 
regulatory approval of a new drug is never guaranteed 
the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process 
despite the time and experience exerted  failure can occur at any stage  and we could encounter problems that could cause us to abandon clinical trials 
we have completed three phase clinical trials and are conducting two phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate  advexin therapy  for the treatment of head and neck cancer 
in addition  we have completed a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer and are conducting a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy for the treatment of breast cancer 
we also are conducting or have conducted several phase and phase clinical trials of advexin therapy for other types of cancer 
current or future clinical trials may demonstrate that advexin therapy is neither safe nor effective 
while we have completed enrollment in a phase early phase clinical trial of ingn  a product candidate based on the mda gene  our most significant clinical trial activity and experience has been with advexin therapy 
we will need to continue conducting significant research and animal testing  referred to as pre clinical testing  to support performing clinical trials for our other product candidates 
it will take us many years to complete pre clinical testing and clinical trials  and failure could occur at any stage of testing 
current or future clinical trials may demonstrate that ingn or our other product candidates are neither safe nor effective 
any delays or difficulties we encounter in our pre clinical research and clinical trials  in particular the phase clinical trials of advexin therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer  may delay or preclude regulatory approval 
our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or regulatory approvals or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned 
any delay or preclusion could also delay or preclude the commercialization of advexin therapy or any other product candidates 
in addition  we or the fda might delay or halt any of our clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons  including the product candidate is less effective and or more toxic than current therapies  the presence of unforeseen adverse side effects of a product candidate  including its delivery system  a longer than expected time required to determine whether or not a product candidate is effective  the death of patients during a clinical trial  even if the product candidate did not cause those deaths  the failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials  the inability to produce sufficient quantities of a product candidate to complete the trials  or the inability to commit the necessary resources to fund the clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that the results we observed in our pre clinical testing will be confirmed in clinical trials or that the results of any of our clinical trials will support fda approval 
pre clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in many different ways  and fda officials could interpret data that we consider promising differently  which could halt or delay our clinical trials or prevent regulatory approval 
despite the fda s designation of advexin therapy as a fast track product  we may encounter delays in the regulatory approval process due to additional information requirements from the fda  unintentional omissions in our biologics license application for advexin therapy  or other delays in the fda s review 
table of contents process 
we may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
even if our products are approved by regulatory authorities  if we fail to comply with on going regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market 
any product for which we obtain marketing approval  along with the manufacturing processes  post approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product  will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by fda and other regulatory bodies 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or certain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products  including unanticipated adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturer or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements  may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of the products from the market  voluntary or mandatory recall  fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product seizures or detention  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs could prevent us from selling our products in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 
for marketing drugs and biologics outside the united states  the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require additional testing 
the time required to obtain approvals outside the united states may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approval on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the fda 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or to obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop these markets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have a history of operating losses  expect to incur significant additional operating losses and may never become profitable 
we have generated operating losses since we began operations in june as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses and losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities increase 
as we expand our operations and develop systems to support commercialization of our product candidates  these losses  among other things  have had  and are expected to continue to have  an adverse impact on our total assets  stockholders equity and working capital 
we have no products that have generated any commercial revenue 
presently  we earn minimal revenue from contract services activities  grants  interest income and rent from the lease of a portion of our facilities to the university of texas m 
d 
anderson cancer center 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future  and we may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of products 
if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than we anticipate and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to advance our development program and complete our clinical trials 
developing a new drug and conducting clinical trials is expensive 
our product development efforts may not lead to commercial products  either because our product candidates fail to be found safe or effective in 
table of contents clinical trials or because we lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to pursue our programs through commercialization 
our capital and future revenues may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations  the development of commercial infrastructure and the conduct of our clinical trials and pre clinical research 
we expect that we will fund our operations over approximately the next to months with our current working capital  which we accumulated primarily from sale of equity securities  income from contract services and research grants  debt financing of equipment acquisitions  the lease of a portion of our facilities to m

anderson cancer center and interest on invested funds 
we may need to raise additional capital sooner  however  under various circumstances  including if we experience an acceleration of the number  size or complexity of our clinical trials  slower than expected progress in developing advexin therapy  ingn or other product candidates  higher than expected costs to obtain regulatory approvals  higher than expected costs to pursue our intellectual property strategy  higher than expected costs to further develop and scale up our manufacturing capability  higher than expected costs to develop our sales and marketing capability  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development and clinical trial activities  the amount and timing of milestone payments we receive from collaborators  the costs of preparing an application for fda approval of advexin therapy  the costs of developing the processes and systems to support fda approval of advexin therapy  our timetable and costs for the development of marketing operations and other activities related to the commercialization of advexin therapy and our other product candidates  our degree of success in our phase clinical trial of advexin therapy and in the clinical trials of our other products  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  and changes in or terminations of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we may need to raise any necessary funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
if we raise funds through debt financings  we may become subject to restrictive covenants 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may have to delay  reduce or eliminate our clinical trials and our development programs 
if we cannot maintain our existing corporate and academic arrangements and enter into new arrangements  we may be unable to develop products effectively  or at all 
our strategy for the research  development and commercialization of our product candidates may result in our entering into contractual arrangements with corporate collaborators  academic institutions and others 
we have entered into sponsored research  license and or collaborative arrangements with several entities  including m 
d 
anderson cancer center  the national cancer institute  chiba university in japan  virrx and corixa corporation  as well as numerous other institutions that conduct clinical trials work for us 
our success depends upon our collaborative partners performing their responsibilities under these arrangements 
table of contents and complying with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborative partners devote to our research and testing programs or product candidates  or their compliance with regulatory requirements which can vary because of factors unrelated to such programs or product candidates 
these relationships may in some cases be terminated at the discretion of our collaborative partners with only limited notice to us 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements  enter into new arrangements or negotiate current or new arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
some of our collaborative partners may also be researching competing technologies independently from us to treat the diseases targeted by our collaborative programs 
if we are not able to create effective collaborative marketing relationships  we may be unable to market advexin therapy successfully or in a cost effective manner 
to effectively market our products  we will need to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
in order to develop or otherwise obtain these capabilities  we may have to enter into marketing  distribution or other similar arrangements with third parties in order to sell  market and distribute our products successfully 
to the extent that we enter into any such arrangements with third parties  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties 
we have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capability 
we may be unable to develop sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize our products successfully 
serious and unexpected side effects attributable to gene therapy may result in governmental authorities imposing additional regulatory requirements or a negative public perception of our products 
advexin therapy and our other product candidates under development could be broadly described as gene therapies 
a number of clinical trials are being conducted by other pharmaceutical companies involving gene therapy  including compounds similar to  or competitive with  our product candidates 
the announcement of adverse results from these clinical trials  such as serious unwanted and unexpected side effects attributable to treatment  any response by the fda to such clinical trials  may impede the timing of our clinical trials  delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or negatively influence public perception of our product candidates  which could harm our business and results of operations and depress the value of our stock 
for example  in  the fda placed a clinical hold on gene therapy clinical trials using retroviral vectors to transduce hematopoietic stem cells after two participants in such a trial for the x linked form of severe combined immune deficiency disease x scid  being conducted in europe  developed what appeared to be a leukemia like illness 
this clinical hold requires a case by case review of the use of retroviral vectors in these european trials before consideration of the removal of this clinical hold for these trials 
we do not use retroviral vectors in our ongoing clinical trials and are not developing products using the production process used in those clinical trials 
we have received no communications from the fda to indicate this clinical hold will affect our clinical trials  and we anticipate no future negative effects on our clinical trials from this event but we cannot assure you that the fda or any other regulatory authority will not issue a clinical hold with respect to any of our clinical trials in the future 
in accordance with our pharmacovigilance procedures and regulatory procedures  we monitor every patient in our clinical trials for safety and report all side effects to the fda and the national institutes of health  or nih 
the united states senate has held hearings concerning the adequacy of regulatory oversight of gene therapy clinical trials  as well as the adequacy of research subject education and protection in clinical research in general  and to determine whether additional legislation is required to protect healthy volunteers and patients who participate in such clinical trials 
the recombinant dna advisory committee  or rac  which acts as an advisory body to the nih has expanded its public role in evaluating important public and ethical issues in gene therapy clinical trials 
implementation of any additional review and reporting procedures or other additional regulatory measures could increase the costs of or prolong our product development efforts or clinical trials 

table of contents we report to the fda and other regulatory agencies serious adverse events  including those that we believe may be reasonably related to the treatments administered in our clinical trials 
such serious adverse events  whether treatment related or not  could result in negative public perception of our treatments and require additional regulatory review or measures  which could increase the cost of or prolong our clinical trials 
to date the fda has not approved any gene therapy product or gene induced product for sale in the united states 
the commercial success of our products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapy products or gene induced products  which are a new type of disease treatment for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene therapy products or gene induced products are unsafe  and these treatment methodologies may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 
negative public reaction to gene therapy products or gene induced products could also result in greater government regulation and stricter clinical trial oversight 
we cannot predict the safety profile of the use of advexin therapy when used in combination with other therapeutics 
many of our trials involve the use of advexin therapy in combination with other drugs or therapies 
while the data we have evaluated to date suggest that advexin therapy does not increase the adverse effects of other therapies  we cannot predict if this will continue to be true or whether possible adverse side effects not directly attributable to the other drugs will compromise the safety profile of advexin therapy when used in certain combination therapies 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing drugs 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and other technologies and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges 
our patent position  like that of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is highly uncertain 
one uncertainty is that the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  or the courts  may deny or significantly narrow claims made under patents issued to us or patent applications we file 
this is particularly true for patent applications or patents that concern biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies  such as ours  since the pto and the courts often consider these technologies to involve unpredictable sciences 
another uncertainty is that any patents that may be issued or licensed to us may not provide any competitive advantage to us because they may not effectively preclude others from developing and marketing products like ours 
also  our patents may be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made significant investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our potential products either in the united states or in international markets 
our ability to develop and protect a competitive position based on our biotechnological innovations  innovations involving genes  gene induced therapeutic protein agents  viruses for delivering the genes to cells  formulations  gene therapy delivery systems that do not involve viruses  and the like  is particularly uncertain 
due to the unpredictability of the biotechnological sciences  the pto  as well as patent offices in other jurisdictions  has often required that patent applications concerning biotechnology related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application  thereby limiting their scope of protection against competitive challenges 
similarly  courts have invalidated or significantly narrowed many key patents in the biotechnology industry 
thus  even if we are able to obtain patents that cover commercially significant innovations  our patents may not be upheld or our patents may be substantially narrowed 
through our exclusive license from the university of texas system for technology developed at m 
d 
anderson cancer center  we have obtained and are currently seeking further patent protection for adenoviral p  including advexin therapy  and its use in cancer therapy 
further  the pto issued us a united states patent for our adenovirus production technology 
we also control  through licensing arrangements  four issued united states patents for combination therapy involving the p gene and conventional chemotherapy or 
table of contents radiation  one issued united states patent covering the use of adenoviral p in cancer therapy  one issued united states patent covering adenoviral p as a product and an issued united states patent covering the core dna of adenoviral p we have recently been notified by the pto that additional applications relating to our adenoviral p  purified adenoviral composition and mda technology have been allowed 
we cannot assure you these allowed applications will actually issue as united states patents 
our competitors may challenge the validity of one or more of our patents in the courts or through an administrative procedure known as an interference  in which the pto determines the priority of invention where two or more parties are claiming the same invention 
the courts or the pto may not uphold the validity of our patents  we may not prevail in such interference proceedings regarding our patents and none of our patents may give us a competitive advantage 
in this regard  we have recently been notified by the pto that an unidentified third party is attempting to provoke an interference with one of our patents directed to adenoviral p therapy 
we do not at present know the identity of this party  and cannot assess the likelihood that an interference will actually be declared 
should that party prevail in an interference proceeding  a patent may issue to that party that is infringed by  and therefore potentially preclude our commercialization of  products like advexin therapy that are used for adenoviral p therapy 
schering plough has filed with the european patent office  or epo  an opposition against our european patent directed to combination therapy with p and conventional chemotherapy and or radiation 
an opposition is an administrative proceeding instituted by a third party and conducted by the epo to determine whether a patent should be maintained or revoked in part or in whole  based on evidence brought forth by the party opposing the patent 
the epo held an initial oral proceeding on october  and determined that our patent should be maintained as amended 
schering plough can appeal this decision 
resolution of such an appeal  if taken  will require that we expend time  effort and money 
if schering plough ultimately prevails in having our european patent revoked on appeal  then the scope of our protection for our product in europe will be reduced 
we would not expect  however  such a result to have a significant impact on our commercialization efforts in europe 
third party claims of infringement of intellectual property could require us to spend time and money to address the claims and could limit our intellectual property rights 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are aware of a number of issued patents and patent applications that relate to gene therapy  the treatment of cancer and the use of the p and other tumor suppressor genes 
schering plough corporation  including its subsidiary canji  inc  controls various united states patent applications and a european patent and applications  some of which are directed to therapy using the p gene  and others to adenoviruses that contain the p gene  or adenoviral p  and to methods for carrying out therapy using adenoviral p adenoviral p technology underlies our advexin therapy product candidate 
in addition  canji controls an issued united states patent and its international counterparts  including a european patent  involving a method of treating mammalian cancer cells lacking normal p protein by introducing a p gene into the cancer cell 
furthermore  we are aware of a united states patent directed to replication deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors apparently controlled by transgene sa 
while we believe that the claims of the canji p patents or the transgene adenoviral vector patent are invalid or not infringed by our products  transgene  canji or schering plough could assert a claim against us 
one of the foregoing patent applications directed to p therapy  which we understand is owned by the johns hopkins university and controlled by schering plough  is involved in a pto interference proceeding with a patent owned by canji 
we further understand that this johns hopkins application is the united states counterpart to the european patent that was recently revoked in its entirety by the epo see below 
we have now learned that priority of invention in this interference has been awarded by the pto to the johns hopkins application  and the canji patent has been found unpatentable 
we cannot at present assess whether any patent might ultimately issue on the johns hopkins application or the potential impact  if any  of this pto ruling on our business 
if this application issues as a patent  schering plough or johns hopkins may assert that our advexin therapy  which uses p therapy  infringes the claims of such patent 
while we believe 
table of contents that we would have an invalidity defense against such an assertion  in the united states an issued patent enjoys a presumption of validity  which can be overcome only through clear and convincing evidence 
we cannot assure you that such a defense would prevail 
we may also become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of other patents and pending applications of our competitors  if they issue  or additional interference proceedings declared by the pto to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  pto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents  to protect our trade secrets and know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities  require us to obtain licenses from third parties  or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets 
although patent and intellectual property disputes are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in particular  if we were found to infringe a valid claim of the transgene adenoviral vector united states patent  canji p issued united states patent or a claim that may issue from a currently pending application  such as the johns hopkins application discussed above or other patents that might issue with similar claims  our business could be materially harmed 
we are currently involved in opposing three european patents in proceedings before the epo  in which we are seeking to have the epo revoke three different european patents owned or controlled by canji schering plough 
these european patents relate to the use of a p gene  or the use of tumor suppressor genes  in the preparation of therapeutic products 
in one opposition involving a european patent directed to the use of a tumor suppressor gene  the epo revoked the european patent in its entirety 
canji has appealed this revocation 
a hearing to determine the outcome of this appeal is scheduled for late april in the second opposition  involving a patent that is directed to therapeutic and other applications of the p gene and that is owned by johns hopkins and  we understand  controlled by schering plough  the epo recently revoked the patent in its entirety 
the patent owner has appealed this decision 
in a third case involving the use of a p gene  the european patent at issue was upheld following an initial hearing 
a second hearing to determine whether this patent should be revoked will be held in late april if we do not ultimately prevail in one or more of these oppositions  our competitors could seek to assert by means of litigation any patent surviving opposition against european commercial activities involving our potential products 
if our competitors are successful in any such litigation  it could have a significant detrimental effect on our ability to commercialize our potential commercial products in europe 
we may be subject to litigation and infringement claims that may be costly  divert management s attention  and materially harm our business 
extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights has been common in the biopharmaceutical industry 
litigation may be necessary to assert infringement claims  enforce patent rights  protect trade secrets or know how and determine the enforceability  scope and validity of certain proprietary rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits  pto interference proceedings  and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue and their outcome is uncertain 
regardless of merit or outcome  our involvement in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings could cause us to incur substantial expense and could significantly divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may include substantial cost and ongoing royalties 
licenses may not be available from third parties  or may not be obtainable on satisfactory terms 
an adverse determination or a failure to obtain necessary licenses may restrict or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  if any 
these outcomes could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements  we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends 
our business depends in part on patents licensed from third parties 
those third party license agreements impose obligations on us  such as payment obligations and obligations to diligently pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents 
if a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement  the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights  which could lead to costly and time consuming litigation and  potentially  a loss of the licensed rights 
during the period of any such litigation  our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of products candidates could be significantly and negatively affected 
if our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost  our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform would be severely adversely affected 
competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete 
we compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including canji  inc and genvec  inc  which are pursuing forms of treatment similar to ours for the diseases advexin therapy and our other product candidates target 
we are aware that canji  with its parent schering plough corporation  has in the past been involved in research and or development of adenoviral p products and has numerous patents and patent applications relating to adenoviral p therapy 
we understand that schering plough has stopped its adenoviral p clinical trials  and it is unknown whether these parties are continuing their adenoviral p research and or development efforts 
we are also aware that a chinese pharmaceutical company  sibiono genetech  inc  has recently announced that it has received regulatory approval from the chinese drug regulatory agency to market an adenoviral p product in china 
we control an issued chinese patent covering adenoviral p  and a number of pending chinese applications directed to p therapy and adenoviral production 
we do not at present know whether sibiono s adenoviral p product is covered by patent protection or whether it infringes our chinese patent or pending applications 
we understand that enforcement of patents in china is unpredictable and we do not know if monetary damages could be recovered from sibiono genetech if its product infringes our patent or patent applications 
patent enforcement and respect of international patent standards  rules and laws have not historically been a key characteristic of the chinese government and patent system 
further  geopolitical developments  including trade and tariff disputes that are currently ongoing between the government of china and the united states department of commerce could add additional uncertainty to any effort to enforce patents  recover damages  if any  or engage in the sales and marketing of patented products in china 
we also may face competition from companies that may develop internally or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions 
as these companies develop their technologies  they may develop competitive positions that may prevent or limit our product commercialization efforts 
some of our competitors are established companies with greater financial and other resources than ours 
other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do  obtaining fda approval for products more rapidly than we do or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates 
while we will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive  research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or non competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us 
even if we receive regulatory approval to market advexin therapy  ingn  ingn or other product candidates  we may not be able to commercialize them profitably 
our profitability will depend on the market s acceptance of advexin therapy  ingn  ingn  if approved  and our other product candidates 
the commercial success of our product candidates will depend on whether they are more effective than alternative treatments  their side effects are acceptable to patients and doctors  
table of contents insurers and other third party healthcare payers will provide adequate reimbursement for them  we produce and sell them at a profit  and we market advexin therapy  ingn  ingn and other product candidates effectively 
because the target patient populations for the primary indication of advexin therapy  our lead product candidate  are small  we must achieve significant market share and obtain high per patient prices for our products to achieve profitability 
advexin therapy  our lead product candidate for the treatment of recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck  targets diseases with small patient populations 
as a result  our per patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development costs and achieve profitability 
we estimate that the annual incidence for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is  patients in the united states 
we believe that we will need to market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration 
in addition  we are developing other drug candidates to treat cancers with small patient populations 
due to the expected costs of treatment for advexin therapy  we may be unable to obtain sufficient market share for our drug products at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts 
if we are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or obtain regulatory approvals for our manufacturing facility  or if our manufacturing process is found to infringe a valid patented process of another company  then we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
to complete our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates  if approved  we will need access to  or development of  facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates 
we have used a manufacturing facility in houston  texas  which we constructed and own  to manufacture advexin therapy  ingn and other product candidates for currently planned clinical trials 
we anticipate that this facility is suitable for the initial commercial launch of advexin therapy 
we have no experience manufacturing advexin therapy  ingn or any other product candidates in the volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in clinical or  when necessary  commercial quantities  then we will need to rely on third party manufacturers to produce our products for clinical and commercial purposes 
these third party manufacturers must receive fda approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial product 
our products may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give other products greater priority than ours 
in addition  we may not be able to enter into any necessary third party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms 
there are very limited contract manufacturers who currently have the capability to produce advexin therapy  ingn or our other product candidates  and the inability of any of these contract manufacturers to deliver our required quantities of product candidates timely and at commercially reasonable prices would negatively affect our operations 
before we can begin commercially manufacturing advexin therapy  ingn or any other product candidate  we must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facility and process 
manufacturing of our product candidates for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices requirements  commonly known as cgmp requirements  and foreign regulatory requirements 
the cgmp requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures 
in complying with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements  we will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
we must also pass a pre approval inspection prior to fda approval 
our current manufacturing facilities have not yet been subject to an fda or other regulatory dossier related inspection 
failure to pass a pre approval inspection may significantly delay fda approval of our products 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products 
further  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to perform unannounced periodic inspections of our manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements 
our facility in houston  texas is our only manufacturing facility 
if this facility were to incur significant damage or 
table of contents destruction  then our ability to manufacture advexin therapy  ingn or any other product candidates would be significantly hampered  and our pre clinical testing  clinical trials and commercialization efforts would be delayed 
in order to produce our products in the quantities that we believe will be required to meet anticipated market demand  if our products are approved  we will need to increase  or scale up  our production process 
if we are unable to do so  or if the cost of this scale up is not economically viable to us  we may not be able to produce our products in a sufficient quantity to meet the requirements of future demand 
canji controls a united states patent and the corresponding international applications  including a european counterpart  relating to the purification of viral or adenoviral compositions 
while we believe that our manufacturing process does not infringe this patent  canji could still assert a claim against us 
we may also become subject to infringement claims or litigation if our manufacturing process infringes upon other patents 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue  and their outcome is uncertain 
we rely on only one supplier for some of our manufacturing materials 
any problems experienced by any such supplier could negatively affect our operations 
we rely on third party suppliers for most of the equipment  materials and supplies used in the manufacturing of advexin therapy  ingn and our other product candidates 
some items critical to the manufacture of these product candidates are available from only one supplier or vendor 
we do not have supply agreements with these key suppliers 
to mitigate the related supply risk  we maintain inventories of these items 
any significant problem that one of our sole source suppliers experiences could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until that supplier cures the problem or until we locate an alternative source of supply 
such problems would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations or could require a significant modification to our manufacturing process  which could impair our ability to manufacture our product candidates in a timely manner and negatively affect our operations 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial damages and demand for our product candidates may be reduced 
the testing and marketing of medical products is subject to an inherent risk of product liability claims 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation and significant media attention  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  substantial delay in fda approval  costs of litigation  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage of million per occurrence with a million annual aggregate limit 
this coverage may not be sufficient to protect us fully against product liability claims 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage beyond clinical trials to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against product liability claims could prevent or limit the commercialization of our products 
we use hazardous materials in our business  and any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could harm our business 
our business involves the use of a broad range of hazardous chemicals and materials 
environmental laws impose stringent civil and criminal penalties for improper handling  disposal and storage of these materials 
in 
table of contents addition  in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials  we could be subject to civil damages due to personal injury or property damage caused by the release or exposure 
a failure to comply with environmental laws could result in fines and the revocation of environmental permits  which could prevent us from conducting our business 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially 
the market price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors  including progress and results of our pre clinical and clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations by us or our competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patent and litigation matters  publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to products under development by us or by our competitors  regulatory developments  the announcement of new products by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
any acquisition we might make may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert management resources or dilute stockholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we may acquire assets or businesses principally relating to or complementary to our current operations  and we have in the past evaluated and discussed such opportunities with interested parties 
any acquisitions that we undertake will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in business acquisitions 
these risks include  among other things potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  the difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  diversion of management time and attention and other resources  loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management  the incurrence of amortization expenses  and possible dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  geographic distances may make the integration of businesses more difficult 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 
if we do not progress in our programs as anticipated  our stock price could decrease 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of a variety of clinical  regulatory and other milestones  such as when a certain product candidate will enter clinical development  when a clinical trial will be completed or when an application for regulatory approval will be filed 
some of our estimates are included in this prospectus supplement 
our estimates are based on present facts and a variety of assumptions 
many of 
table of contents the underlying assumptions are outside of our control 
if milestones are not achieved when we expect them to be  investors could be disappointed  and our stock price may decrease 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional  highly skilled personnel required to develop our products or obtain new collaborations  our business will suffer 
we depend  to a significant extent  on the efforts of our key employees  including senior management and senior scientific  clinical  regulatory and other personnel 
the development of new therapeutic products requires expertise from a number of different disciplines  some of which are not widely available 
we depend upon our scientific staff to discover new product candidates and to develop and conduct pre clinical studies of those new potential products 
our clinical and regulatory staff is responsible for the design and execution of clinical trials in accordance with fda requirements and for the advancement of our product candidates toward fda approval 
the quality and reputation of our scientific  clinical and regulatory staff  especially the senior staff  and their success in performing their responsibilities  are a basis on which we attract potential funding sources and collaborators 
in addition  our chief executive officer and other executive officers are involved in a broad range of critical activities  including providing strategic and operational guidance 
the loss of these individuals  or our inability to retain or recruit other key management and scientific  clinical  regulatory and other personnel  may delay or prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we face intense competition for personnel from other companies  universities  public and private research institutions  government entities and other organizations 
some of our insiders are parties to transactions with us that may cause conflicting obligations 
dr 
john n 
kapoor  the chairman of our board of directors  is also associated with ej financial enterprises  inc  a health care investment firm which is wholly owned by him  and therefore may have conflicts of interest in allocating his time among us and his other business activities  and he may have legal obligations to multiple entities 
we have entered into a consulting agreement with ej financial 
the consulting agreement provides that we will pay ej financial  per year for certain management consulting services  which is based on anticipated time spent by ej financial personnel on the company s affairs 
ej financial is also involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
in addition  ej financial is involved with other companies in the cancer field 
although these companies are pursuing different therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer  discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
david parker  phd  phd  our vice president  intellectual property  is a partner with the law firm fulbright jaworski llp  which provides legal services to us as our primary outside counsel for intellectual property matters 
we are in negotiations with dr 
robert sobol  our senior vice president  medical and scientific affairs  to acquire a company of which he is the sole shareholder 
the terms of the proposed transaction have not been determined  but the purchase price is likely to be between million and million and to be paid in shares of our common stock 
we believe the technology which is owned by dr 
sobol s company will be a valuable addition to our intellectual property portfolio 
we have endeavored to conduct the negotiations at arms length  and any transaction would be subject to the approval of the independent members of our board of directors 
in addition  we have relationships with jack a 
roth  md  and the university of texas md anderson cancer center  both of whom are affiliated with the board of regents of the university of texas system  one of our stockholders 
for more information concerning these relationships  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the foregoing transactions with insiders were and are in our best interests  however  the transactions may cause conflicts of interest with respect to those insiders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our fixed rate long term debt and short term investments in investment grade securities  which consist primarily of federal and state government obligations  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized costs 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in the interest rates of our investments at the investment balances as of december  would decrease our interest income by approximately  at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt approximated its carrying value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market prices
