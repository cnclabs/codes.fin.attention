overview the company reported net revenue of  in fiscal  slightly lower than fiscal net revenue of  consolidated net revenue included revenue from th europe of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal this increase from the prior year included approximately  resulting from the translation of the stronger euro in fiscal fiscal net revenue increased slightly from fiscal net revenue of  the decrease in net revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to a decrease in net revenue of the wholesale segment offset  in part  by an increase in net revenue of the retail segment 
within the wholesale segment  a decline in net revenue in the childrenswear component was partially offset by increases in net revenue in the menswear and womenswear components driven by growth in th europe 
within the retail segment  as further described below  net revenue from stores opened since march  was offset  partially  by a decrease in net revenue due to the closing of the us specialty stores mentioned above and declining sales in existing stores in the company s us outlet division 
licensing segment net revenue in fiscal remained essentially unchanged compared to fiscal as higher royalty income on various licensed products  as well as international licenses  offset the loss of royalty revenue associated with the men s underwear business which was taken in house on june  the fluctuations in net revenue in each of these segments were primarily volume related and are further described below in the segment operations section 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to an increase in net revenue of the retail and licensing segments  offset  in part  by a decrease in the wholesale segment net revenue 
net revenue by segment after elimination of intersegment revenue was as follows fiscal year ended march  wholesale retail licensing total gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement in gross margin was mainly due to an improvement in the gross margin of the company s wholesale segment 
gross margin in the wholesale segment benefited from improved gross margins of  and a higher contribution from  th europe in fiscal as compared to fiscal th europe generates a higher gross margin than the company s domestic components 
during fiscal  the us wholesale division continued its efforts to bring supply and demand into balance 
as part of this process  the company reevaluated the level of price adjustments it previously provided for its retailers and reduced its estimated accrual for such price adjustments  increasing gross profit by approximately  during the first quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these improvements was a slightly lower gross margin in the retail segment  reflecting higher markdowns in the united states  compared to last year 
the company s gross margins may not be directly comparable to those of its competitors  as income statement classifications of certain expenses may vary by company 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement was due to an improvement in the gross margin of the company s wholesale segment  due to a higher contribution of th europe in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as well as a higher contribution of the retail segment  which generates a

excluding these special items  operating expenses increased to  or of net revenue  in fiscal compared to  or of net revenue  in fiscal the company believes that results before special items provide a more meaningful comparison of the company s ongoing operating expenses 
the overall increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as the increase as a percentage of net revenue is due to increased expenses of the wholesale segment partially offset by a decrease in the company s retail segment 
the increase in the wholesale segment operating expenses was mainly due to the increased expenses in the europe wholesale division incurred to support its growth and from the translation of the stronger euro in fiscal  partially offset by reduced expenses in the us wholesale division 
the decrease in the retail segment operating expenses was primarily due to closing us specialty stores since march  offset  in part  by increased expenses in the company s us outlet  european and canadian retail divisions incurred to support growth and  in the case of the european subsidiary  from the translation of the stronger euro in fiscal operating expenses increased to  or of net revenue  in fiscal from  or of net revenue  in fiscal this increase was principally due to the impairment of goodwill of  recorded in fiscal and the special items recorded in operating expenses of  related to the closure of the specialty stores  both of which are described above 
excluding these special items  operating expenses increased to  or of net revenue  in fiscal compared to  or of net revenue  in fiscal also contributing to the increase was an increase in operating expenses of the wholesale segment due to the increased expenses in the europe wholesale division incurred to support its growth and its operations for the entire fiscal year as compared to nine months in fiscal  and the retail segment  partially offset by a decrease in the company s corporate division operating expenses  as well as the elimination of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization of  interest and other expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  after increasing from  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the repayment  upon maturity  in june  of  principal amount of the notes which matured on june  the notes and a lower average level of debt in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to interest expense associated with the issuance of  principal amount of senior bonds due december  the bonds 
the bonds were issued on december  and were outstanding for the entire fiscal year as opposed to four months in fiscal year  partially offset by the lower interest expense due to the repurchase  prior to maturity  of  principal amount of the notes

the company believes that results before special items provide a more meaningful comparison of the company s effective tax rate  particularly because of the loss before income taxes reported in fiscal the provision for taxes increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the effective tax rate for all periods is primarily attributable to the relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which the company s earnings are subject as well as changes in tax laws affecting the company s operations

the lower average unit prices accounted for approximately of the decrease while lower volume accounted for the remaining of the decrease 
the lower average unit prices were driven by a change in the mix between the company s normal off price channels and major us department store customers 
also  the mens underwear division which was brought in house in fiscal  has a lower average unit price than the overall us wholesale component 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of  in net revenue of th europe  which benefited from growth in each of its components  particularly menswear and womenswear  and the effect of currency translation

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies employed by the company  including the use of estimates  are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in item critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are uncertain at the time and where different estimates that management reasonably could have used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company s most critical accounting estimates relate to the following adjustments to revenue  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes and goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets  as discussed 
table of contents below 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these critical estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates and such differences could be material 
adjustments to revenue net revenue from wholesale product sales is recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of ownership to customers 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of discounts  as well as provisions for estimated returns  allowances and doubtful accounts 
on a seasonal basis  the company negotiates price adjustments with retailers as sales incentives or to partially reimburse them for the cost of certain promotions 
the company estimates the cost of such adjustments on an ongoing basis considering historical trends  projected seasonal results and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
these costs are recorded as a reduction to net revenue 
the company s estimates of these costs have historically been reasonably accurate 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain retail store customers 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historic trends and an evaluation of economic conditions 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
substantially all inventories are comprised of finished goods 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
the market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
income taxes the company has recorded its provision for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company evaluates the probability of realizing its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
this evaluation includes estimating the company s future taxable income in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates as well as the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
the company is required to provide a valuation allowance if it is determined to be more likely than not that the company will not be able to realize certain of its deferred tax assets 
for certain of the company s deferred tax assets  the company had previously determined that it was not more likely than not that these assets will be realized and recorded the appropriate valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize certain of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
conversely  if the company should determine that an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance is required  such an adjustment would be charged to income tax expense in the period such conclusion was reached 
the company does not record a provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of tommy hilfiger canada  inc  which it does not expect to repatriate in the foreseeable future 

table of contents goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets effective april   the company adopted sfas sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
before adopting the provisions of sfas  the company amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
beginning in fiscal  consistent with the requirements of sfas  the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill annually for impairment 
in addition  trademarks that have been deemed to have indefinite lives  are reviewed at least annually for potential value impairment 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of other long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company reviews long lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
seasonality the company s business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
the company s wholesale revenue  particularly that from its european operations  is generally highest during the second and fourth fiscal quarters  while the company s retail segment generally contributes its highest levels of revenue during the third fiscal quarter 
as the timing of wholesale product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter might not be indicative of results for the full year 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its net revenue or profitability in recent years 
exchange rates the company received united states dollars for approximately of its product sales during fiscal substantially all inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are also denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
the company does  however  seek to protect against adverse movements in currency exchange rates which might affect certain firm commitments or transactions 
these include the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures  collection of foreign royalty payments and certain intercompany commitments 
the company enters into forward contracts  generally with maturities up to months  to sell or purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against such risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at march   the company had contracts to exchange foreign currencies  principally  the japanese yen  the euro and the canadian dollar  having a total notional amount of  no significant gain or loss was inherent in such contracts at march  gains or losses on such forward contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income on a mark to market basis and  ultimately  in earnings at the time the underlying hedge transaction is completed or recognized in earnings 
while a hypothetical adverse change in all of the relevant exchange rates would potentially cause a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately  the company would experience an offsetting benefit in the underlying transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
sab expands previously issued guidance on the subject of revenue recognition and provides specific criteria which must be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from transactions 
the company does not expect the issuance of sab to have any effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
