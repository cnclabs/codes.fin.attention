segment information pharmaceutical distribution segment pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of billion for the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from billion in the prior fiscal year 
the company s change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of reducing operating revenue growth by for the fiscal year ended september  during the fiscal year ended september   of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail 
in comparison with prior year results  sales to institutional customers increased in fiscal primarily due to the above market rate growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals  which was offset in part by the discontinuance of servicing the united states department of veterans affairs va during the fiscal year ended september  as a result of losing a competitive bid process 
the va contract was terminated in may and contributed and of the segment s operating revenue in the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
in march  caremark rx  inc acquired advance pcs  one of the company s largest customers 
as a result  the company s contract with advance pcs was terminated in august advance pcs accounted for approximately and of the segment s operating revenue in the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
sales to retail customers increased over the prior fiscal year 
the independent retail sector experienced strong double digit sales growth while sales in the chain retail sector decreased by due to sales declines experienced by certain large regional retail chain customers 
additionally  retail sales in the first half of fiscal were adversely impacted by the prior fiscal year loss of a large customer 
this segment s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
the segment s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry growth rates  as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc  are expected to be from to over the next three years 
future operating revenue growth will continue to be driven by industry growth trends  competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing policies  and potential changes in federal government rules and regulations 
the company s specialty group has been growing at rates significantly in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth 
the majority of this group s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  such as oncology  nephrology  and rheumatology 
additionally  the specialty group distributes vaccines and blood plasma 
the specialty group s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the specialty group s most significant contributor to revenue growth 
as early as january  the specialty group s business may be adversely impacted by proposed changes in the reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  including oncology drugs 
the reimbursement changes recently proposed by the us department of health and human services pursuant to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare modernization act  or that may be proposed in the future  may have the effect of reducing the amount of medications administered by physicians in their offices  which may force patients to other healthcare providers 
this may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the specialty group 
although the specialty group is preparing contingency plans to enable it to retain its distribution volume  there can be no assurance that the specialty group will retain all of the distribution volume currently going through the physician channel 

table of contents pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of  million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects a decrease of from  million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the result of a reduction in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases  the va contract loss  the continuing competitive environment  which has led to a number of contract renewals with reduced profitability  and the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional  mail order and chain accounts 
downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin  including increases derived from manufacturer price increases  negotiated deals and alternate source market opportunities  will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline of the sell side margin 
the company expects that buy side purchasing opportunities will continue to decrease in the future as pharmaceutical manufacturers increasingly seek to control the supply channel through product allocations that limit the inventory the company can purchase and through the imposition of inventory management and other agreements that prohibit or restrict the company s right to purchase inventory from alternate source suppliers 
although the company seeks in any such agreements to obtain appropriate compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for foregoing buy side purchasing opportunities  there can be no assurance that the agreements will function as intended and replace any or all lost profit opportunities 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s payments under current pharmaceutical manufacturer agreements are triggered by pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases 
these may lead to significant earnings volatility 
although the company is negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers to change the payment trigger and lessen its dependence on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in transforming its relationships to a fee for service structure from their current structure

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects a decrease of from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline over the prior year percentage was due to a reduction in gross margins in excess of the declines in the operating expense ratios 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will offset possible declines in gross margins 
pharmerica segment pharmerica operating revenue of  million for the fiscal year ended september  reflects a decrease of from  million in the prior fiscal year 
pharmerica s decline in operating revenue is primarily due to the loss of two significant customers in the workers compensation business  the discontinuance of the sale of healthcare products within the long term care business and the loss of a long term care business customer because it was acquired by a customer of a competitor 
the future operating revenue growth rate may be impacted by competitive pressures  changes in the regulatory environment including reimbursement changes arising from the medicare modernization act and the pharmaceutical inflation rate

pharmerica operating income of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased by from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio  which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins
