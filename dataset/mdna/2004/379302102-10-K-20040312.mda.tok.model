we own  lease  manage and develop a portfolio of retail properties consisting of enclosed regional and super regional malls and community shopping centers 
as of december   we owned interests in and managed properties  consisting of mall properties and community centers including four single tenant retail properties located in states 
the properties contain an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gla of which approximately was occupied at december our primary business objective is to achieve growth in net income and funds from operations  or ffo  by developing and acquiring retail properties  by improving the operating performance and value of our existing portfolio through selective expansion and renovation of our properties and by maintaining high occupancy rates  increasing minimum rents per square foot of gla and aggressively controlling costs 
key elements of our growth strategies and operating policies are to increase property values by aggressively marketing available gla and renewing existing leases negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents capitalize on management s long standing relationships with national and regional retailers and extensive experience in marketing to local retailers  as well as exploit the leverage inherent in a larger portfolio of properties in order to lease available space utilize our team oriented management approach to increase productivity and efficiency acquire strategically located malls hold properties for long term investment and emphasize regular maintenance  periodic renovation and capital improvements to preserve and maximize value selectively dispose of assets we believe have achieved long term investment potential and re deploy the proceeds control operating costs by utilizing our employees to perform management  leasing  marketing  finance  accounting  construction supervision  legal and information technology services renovate  reconfigure or expand properties and utilize existing land available for expansion and development of outparcels to meet the needs of existing or new tenants utilize our development capabilities to develop quality properties at low costs 
our strategy is to be a leading reit focusing on enclosed malls located primarily in the top metropolitan statistical areas by population 
we intend to continue investing in our existing mall properties and disposing of certain community centers as the marketplace creates favorable opportunities to do so 
we expect to continue investing in select development opportunities and in strategic acquisitions of mall properties that provide growth potential 
our goal is to have our mall properties eventually comprise over of our annualized minimum rents 
as of december   the mall properties comprise of our annualized minimum rents 
we expect to finance acquisition transactions with cash on hand  borrowings under credit facilities  proceeds from asset dispositions  proceeds from secured mortgage financing  proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of trustees 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy relating to minimum rents does not require use of estimates 
percentage rents  tenant reimbursements and the component of other revenue associated with outparcel sales include estimates 
the tenant reimbursement estimates are discussed in the accounts receivable section below 
percentage rents the recognition of percentage rents income requires management to make certain estimates with regard to tenants sales levels 
the majority of the company s tenants report sales on a monthly basis  which provides the company with a reasonable basis upon which to record this income 
the monthly sales amounts  however  are unaudited and subject to change when the tenant reports its final sales after the end of the lease year 
in addition  leases sometimes permit the exclusion of certain types of sales or services from the calculation of percentage rent due 
outparcel sales the company sells outparcels at its various properties 
the estimated cost used to calculate the margin from these sales involves a number of estimates 
the estimates made are based either upon assigning a proportionate cost  based upon historical cost paid for the total parcel  to the portion of the parcel that is sold or by incorporating the sales value method 
the proportionate share of actual cost is derived through consideration of numerous factors 
these factors include items such as ease of access to the parcel  visibility from high traffic areas and other factors that may differentiate the desirability of the particular section of the parcel that is sold 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used to establish cost reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate tax and insurance tenant accounts receivable  and for accounts receivable reserves 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and variations in computations between properties and tenants exists 
adjustments are also made throughout the year to these receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected 
the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write offs 
based on its analysis  the company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the company s estimate of the amounts of the recorded accounts receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
the company reviews specific tenant balances  if the financial condition of the company s tenants deteriorates as a result of operating difficulties or tenants operating under bankruptcy protection  additional provisions may be required 
investment in real estate the company maintains a diverse portfolio of real estate assets 
the portfolio holdings have increased as a result of both acquisitions and the development of new properties and have been reduced by selected sales of assets 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of acquisition and developments and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on the application of accounting standards that may require estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the company allocates the cost of the acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its recent acquisitions 
the valuation of the fair value of the intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions  probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in place leases 
this market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant s industry  location within the property and competition in the specific geography in which the property operates 
differences in the amount attributed to the intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in real estate assets to be held and used and records an impairment charge when there is an indicator of impairment and the undiscounted projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property 
the estimated cash flows used for the impairment analysis and to determine estimated fair value are based on the company s plans for the respective assets and the company s views of market and economic conditions 
the estimates consider matters such as current and historical rental rates  occupancies for the respective properties and comparable properties and recent sales data for comparable properties 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the company s plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses which  under the applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
the sale of real estate assets may also involve the application of judgments in determining whether the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer and that a sale has been completed for purposes of recognizing a gain on the sale 
although the company has  from time to time  entered into negotiations or contracts that cover the sale of individual assets  the asset sales have not been part of a plan to dispose of specific holdings 
the determination of whether specific assets are classified as held for sale or maintained as operating assets which continue to be depreciated  reflects management s judgment and future intent with respect to the properties 
depreciation expense for real estate assets is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets forty years for buildings and improvements and five to ten years for equipment and fixtures 
expenditures for leasehold improvements and construction allowances paid to tenants are capitalized and amortized over the term of each lease 
derivatives the company has used interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure and interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and all contracts are intended to be effective as hedges of specific interest rate risk exposures 
in connection with the determination of the effectiveness of these hedges and the recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on these contracts  the company computes the fair value of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
the company at times employs an external  third party to perform an independent assessment of the fair value of the derivatives portfolio 
the aggregate fair value of the company s derivative instruments was million and million at december  and  respectively 
funds from operations the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company has also indicated that ffo is a key measure of financial performance 
ffo is an important and widely used financial measure of operating performance in its industry  which the company believes provides important information to investors and a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
management believes that ffo is an appropriate and valuable measure of the company s operating performance because real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains a residual value to a much greater extent than personal property and  accordingly  reductions for real estate depreciation and amortization charges are not meaningful in evaluating the operating results of the properties 
ffo  as defined by nareit defined fully in item is used by the real estate industry and investment community as a supplemental measure of the performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the company s ffo may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo and the reconciliation of ffo to net income available to common shareholders for the years ending december   and in thousands for the years ended december  net income available to common shareholders    add back less real estate depreciation and amortization    share of joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization 
   minority interest in operating partnership   discontinued operations loss gain on sales of properties   gain loss on sales of properties  cumulative effect of accounting change funds from operations    ffo increased by or million for the year ended december  from december  this increase can be attributed to an increase in net income from continuing operations

malls mall store occupancy decreased slightly to at december  from at december  due to lower store occupancy at the newly acquired malls  westshore plaza mall and eastland ohio 
comparable store occupancy increased to from at december  anchor occupancy in the malls remained unchanged at december  and held at during comparable mall anchor occupancy dropped from to  excluding the anchor occupancy at westshore plaza mall and eastland ohio 
the drop in anchors is related to three new vacancies totaling approximately  in gla oshman s supersports usa at the great mall  montgomery ward at northtown a previously vacated anchor the company acquired control of in the second quarter and kmart at southside mall 
this reduction in leased anchor gla was partially offset by four new anchors totaling approximately  of gla 
the new anchors are three steve and barry s stores at grand central mall  northtown mall  river valley mall and phil s shoes at northwest mall 
in october  a plan was finalized to add approximately  of gla to the mfc 
the expansion plans to include a new sporting goods retailer  galyan s

the new community center anchors were hobby lobby at clarksville plaza in clarksville  indiana and rooms of furniture at middletown plaza in middletown  ohio 
this was offset by  square feet of new vacancies due to wal mart closings during in cumberland crossing in jackson  tennessee and newberry square in newberry  south carolina 
community center anchor occupancy improved to on december  compared to at december  due to the sale of three centers with vacant anchors and the sale of a vacant anchor store to home depot resulting in reduced community center vacant anchor gla of  square feet 
the company continues to work with various prospects to lease the remaining vacant space

accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of sfas no

and rescission of fin 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no

the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  the recognition provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  there was no material impact on the company s financial position as a result of this new pronouncement at december  effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas no

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company reported losses from the early extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items 
during the year ended december   the company recorded  thousand in extraordinary items from operations and  thousand in extraordinary items from discontinued operations that resulted from the early extinguishment of debt 
in  these charges were reclassified to interest expense and income from discontinued operations  respectively  to comply with sfas no 
these reclassifications had no impact on reported net income

 consolidation of variable interests entities an interpretation of arb no 
the effective date of the interpretation has been postponed by fasb staff position no 
fin and will be effective the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the interpretation focuses on identifying entities for which a controlling financial interest is achieved through means other than voting rights 
the potential impact of fin has been evaluated regarding potential impact to the company s joint venture interests 
based upon the analysis  the company does not anticipate that fin will have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the company has no immediate impact as a result of this pronouncement 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  there was no material impact on the company s financial position as a result of this new pronouncement at december  risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents the company files with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and other public statements made 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risks inherent in owning real estate investments real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
if the company s properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses and other required expenditures  the company s ability to make dividend distributions will be adversely affected 
the company s income may be adversely affected by the general economic climate  local economic conditions and other local conditions 
examples of other local conditions that could adversely affect income include oversupply of space or reduced demand for rental space and newly developed properties  the attractiveness of the company s properties compared to other space  ability to provide adequate maintenance  and fluctuation in real estate taxes  insurance and other operating costs 
the company is covered under its all risk property insurance policies in the amount of million per incident for acts of terrorism on its consolidated real estate assets through january  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain terrorism insurance on its properties after that date or  if it can  that the premiums for the insurance will be reasonable 
income and real estate values may also be adversely affected by applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
in addition  real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  the company s ability to sell its properties quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions will be limited 
in certain areas of the country there may be an oversupply of retail space 
the company cannot be sure that it will be able to lease space as tenants move out or as to the rents it may be able to charge the new tenants at such space 
reliance on major tenants at december   the three largest tenants were the limited brands  inc  gap  inc  and saks  inc  representing  and of annualized minimum rents  respectively 
no other tenant represented more than of the aggregate annualized minimum rents of the properties as of such date 
the company s financial position and ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the bankruptcy  insolvency or general downturn in the business of any such tenant  or in the event any such tenant does not renew its lease as it expires 
bankruptcy of tenants or downturns in tenants businesses may reduce cash flow since the company derives almost all of its income from rental payments  its cash available for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants were unable to meet their obligations  or if the company was unable to lease vacant space in its properties on economically favorable terms 
at any time  a tenant may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of that tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the cash available for distribution 
if a tenant files for bankruptcy  the company cannot be sure that it will affirm its lease and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
some rents are based on a percentage of the tenant s sales 
a downturn in a tenant s business may weaken its financial condition and result in a reduction in the percentage rent paid by that tenant or in the failure to make rent payments when due 
furthermore  certain of its tenants  including anchor tenants  hold the right under their leases to terminate their leases or reduce their rental rate if certain occupancy conditions are not met  if certain anchor tenants are closed  if certain sales levels or profit margins are not achieved or if an exclusive use provision is violated  all of which may adversely affect operating results 
results of operations for the properties depend on the economic conditions of the regions of the united states in which they are located results of operations and distributions to shareholders will be subject generally to economic conditions in the regions in which the company s properties are located 
for the year ended december   approximately of annualized minimum rents came from properties in ohio 
on january   the company acquired the remaining interests in polaris mall  llc  the owner of polaris fashion place  and polaris center  llc  the owner of polaris towne center  a community center  both located in columbus  ohio 
if the two polaris properties were included as of december   the percentage of annualized minimum rents from properties in ohio would have been 
inability to successfully develop properties or operate developed properties the company intends to selectively pursue development projects 
however  as a result of economic and other conditions  development projects may not be pursued or may be completed later or with higher costs than anticipated 
these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  which the company cannot be sure it will receive 
development activities involving significant risks include the expenditure of funds on and devotion of time to projects which may not come to fruition  the risk that construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project uneconomical  the risk that the company may not be able to obtain construction financing and permanent financing and the risk that such financing terms may not be favorable  and the risk that occupancy rates and rents at a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable 
in the event of an unsuccessful development project  the loss could exceed the investment in the project 
certain limitations on property sales and conflicts of interest gplp may not enter into certain transactions  including the sale of all or substantially all of its assets  without consent from the holders of a majority of the units of partnership interest in gplp excluding glimcher realty trust 
this majority vote requirement effectively means that any such transaction must be approved by herbert glimcher and his sons  david glimcher and michael glimcher  because  together with their spouses  they own approximately of the units in glimcher properties limited partnership which constitutes a majority of the units in gplp other than those owned by glimcher realty trust outstanding as of january  this veto right may limit the company s ability to enter into a liquidating transaction that may be in the shareholders interest 
as a result of herbert glimcher s  david glimcher s and michael glimcher s status as holders of both common shares and units  they have interests that conflict with shareholders with respect to business decisions affecting glimcher realty trust and glimcher properties limited partnership 
in particular  as holders of units  they may suffer different and or more adverse tax consequences than glimcher realty trust upon the sale or refinancing of some of the company s properties due to unrealized gains attributable to these properties 
therefore  glimcher realty trust may have objectives different from herbert glimcher  david glimcher and michael glimcher regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale or refinancing of certain of the company s properties 
although the company through a wholly owned subsidiary  as the sole general partner of glimcher properties limited partnership  has the exclusive authority as to whether and on what terms to sell  refinance or seek to purchase an interest in an individual property  herbert glimcher  david glimcher and michael glimcher might seek to influence decisions with respect to these actions  even though those actions might otherwise be financially advantageous or adverse to glimcher realty trust 
they also may seek to influence management to refinance a property with a higher level of debt than would be in glimcher realty trust s best interests 
significant costs related to environmental issues may be incurred under some environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of on real property  may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating these substances on or under the property 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act  as amended  and similar state laws  impose liability on a joint and several basis  regardless of whether the owner  operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the presence of such hazardous substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of its properties  the company could be liable for such costs in the future 
the costs of any required remediation and liability therefore as to any property could be substantial under these enactments and could exceed the value of the property and or its aggregate assets 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  also may adversely affect the company s ability to sell or rent a property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which the company uses its properties or operates its business  and these restrictions may require expenditures for compliance 
the company does not believe that it currently is subject to any material environmental remediation obligations 
however  it cannot provide assurance that a material environmental claim or compliance obligation will not arise in the future 
the costs of defending against any claims of liability  of remediating a contaminated property or of complying with future environmental requirements could be material and affect operating results 
significant costs complying with the american with disabilities act and similar laws may be incurred under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
the company may incur additional costs of complying with the americans with disabilities act in the future 
additional federal  state and local laws also may require modifications to properties  or restrict the company s ability to renovate its properties 
the company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws 
if substantial costs are incurred to comply with this statute and any other legislation  the financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the common share value and ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected 
failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequence the company believes that it qualifies as a reit under the federal internal revenue code since  but cannot be sure that it will remain so qualified 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions  of which there are only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations  and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company s control and may impact the company s ability to qualify as a reit under the code 
in addition  the company cannot be sure that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws relating to reits  or the federal income tax consequences of reit qualification 
congress has proposed legislation to modify certain tax rules concerning reits 
it is not known whether these or other laws will be enacted in the future and  if enacted  what impact they will have on its ability to operate as a reit 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit  it will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates 
in addition  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  it will also be disqualified from electing to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification is lost 
that would reduce net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability imposed for the year or years involved 
in addition  the company would no longer be required by the code to make any dividend distributions as a condition to reit qualification 
to the extent that dividend distributions to shareholders may have been made in anticipation of qualifying as a reit  the company might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate certain of its investments to pay the applicable tax 
ownership interests in certain partnerships and other ventures are subject to certain tax risks all of the company s property interests and other investments are made or held through glimcher properties limited partnership or partnerships  limited liability companies or other ventures in which glimcher properties limited partnership has an interest the subsidiary partnerships 
the ownership of these interests may involve special tax risks for us 
these risks include possible challenge by the internal revenue service irs of allocations of income and expense items which could affect the computation of the company s taxable income  or a challenge to the status of gplp or the subsidiary partnerships as partnerships as opposed to associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes  as well as the possibility of action being taken by  gplp or the subsidiary partnerships that could adversely affect qualification as a reit  for example  by requiring the sale of a property 
the company believes that gplp and each of the subsidiary partnerships have been and will be treated for tax purposes as partnerships and not treated as associations taxable as corporations 
if the ownership interest in any entity taxable as a corporation exceeded in terms of vote or value of such entity s outstanding securities unless such entity were a taxable reit subsidiary  or a qualified reit subsidiary  as those terms are defined in the code or the value of interest in any such entity exceeded of the value of the company s assets  the company would cease to qualify as a reit  distributions from any of these entities would be treated as dividends  to the extent of earnings and profits  and the company would not be able to deduct its share of losses  if any  generated by such entity in computing its taxable income 
ability to access other sources of funds in order to meet reit distribution requirements in order to qualify to be taxed as a reit  the company must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least of the reit s taxable income determined by excluding any net capital gain 
the amount available for distribution will be affected by a number of factors  including cash flow generated by its properties  distributions received from its subsidiaries  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
the company has sold a number of non core assets and intends in the future to sell additional selected non core assets 
the loss of rental income associated with the properties sold will in turn affect net income and ffo 
in order to maintain reit status  the company may be required to make distributions in excess of net income and ffo 
in such case  it may be necessary to arrange for short term or possibly long term borrowings  or to issue preferred or other securities  to raise funds 
there are limits on the ownership of common shares and limits on changes in control resulting from a staggered board and ability to issue preferred shares in order to maintain the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of the outstanding common shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of the taxable year 
to ensure that the company will not fail to qualify as a reit under this test  the company s organizational documents authorize the trustees to take such action as may be required to preserve qualification as a reit and to limit any person  other than herbert glimcher  david glimcher and any of the trustees  employees and other persons approved by the trustees  to direct or indirect ownership of i of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding common shares and ii of the lesser of the number or value of the total series g preferred shares outstanding 
the trustees may not grant exemptions from these ownership limitations if it would cause the status as a reit to terminate for federal income tax purposes 
herbert glimcher and david glimcher are limited to an aggregate of direct or indirect ownership of the company s common shares 
the trustees have also granted an exemption to cohen steers capital management  inc permitting them to own  directly or indirectly  of record or beneficially i up to  series f preferred shares and ii up to of the lesser of the number or values of the outstanding shares of any other class of the company s equity securities 
however  in no event  shall they be permitted to own  directly or indirectly  of record or beneficially  more than of the lesser of the number or value of all outstanding shares of the company s equity securities 
despite these provisions  the company cannot be sure that there will not be five or fewer individuals who will own more that in value of its outstanding common shares  thereby causing the company to fail to qualify as a reit 
the ownership limits may also discourage a change of control of the company 
the company s board of trustees is divided into three classes 
the terms of class i  class ii and class iii trustees currently expire in  and  respectively 
trustees for each class will be chosen for a three year term upon the expiration of their current term and each year one class of trustees will be elected by the shareholders 
the staggered terms for trustees may affect the ability of the shareholders to change control of the company even if a change of control were in the interests of the shareholders 
certain financing arrangements contain limitations on the amount of debt the company may incur the company s credit facility is the most restrictive of its financing arrangements  and as of december   the total borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were million  and the additional amount that may be borrowed from this facility or other sources based upon the restrictive covenants in the credit facility is million as of december  the ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was as of december  as used herein  total market capitalization means the sum of the outstanding amount of all indebtedness  the total liquidation preference of all preferred shares and the total market value of common shares and units of partnership interest of glimcher properties limited partnership based on the closing price of shares as of december  
the variable rate of debt obligations may impede the company s operating performance and create a competitive disadvantage required repayments of debt and related interest can adversely affect the company s operating performance 
as of december   approximately million of its indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate 
after taking into account the million outstanding letters of credit and the company has the ability to borrow up to an additional million under its existing credit facility  which bears interest at a variable rate 
an increase in interest rates on existing indebtedness would increase interest expense  which could adversely affect cash flow and ability to pay distributions 
for example  if market rates of interest on variable rate debt outstanding as of december   increased by basis points  the increase in interest expense on existing variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
financial condition and distributions could be adversely affected by financial covenants the company s mortgage indebtedness and credit facility impose certain financial and operating restrictions on its properties and also impose restrictions on subordinated financing secured by such properties and financings of other assets and properties 
these restrictions include restrictions on borrowings  prepayments and distributions 
additionally  the credit facility requires certain financial tests to be met and some of the mortgage indebtedness provides for prepayment penalties  each of which could restrict financial flexibility 
risks associated with information systems the company is continuing to implement new information systems and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with the company s operations 
the company has successfully completed the first phase of its enterprise resource planning erp software implementation and is in the process of implementing the second phase of the conversion to erp to replace the lease administration  recoveries accounting  budgeting and treasury management systems 
the company may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
although the company believes that it has identified  to a large extent  potential problems that could be associated with the implementation  unexpected problems could arise that have not been foreseen 
as the company continues implementation and enhancing functionality  the operations could be further disrupted 
such disruptions could adversely impact the ability to invoice tenants  process cash receipts and generate key management reports and financial statements 
the failure to fully recover from tenants cost reimbursements for cam  taxes and insurance could adversely affect the company s operating result the computation of cost reimbursements from tenants for cam  insurance and real estate taxes is complex and involves numerous judgments including interpretation of terms and other tenant lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are variations in computations dealing with such matters as which costs are includable or not includable for reimbursement  what is the square footage of the overall property space to determine the pro rata percentages and the applicability of cost limitation provisions  among other things 
most tenants make monthly fixed payments of cam  real estate taxes and other cost reimbursements items 
the company records these payments as income each month 
the company also makes adjustments  positive or negative  to adjust the recorded amounts to the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to cost reimbursements 
after the end of the calendar year  the company computes each tenant s final cost reimbursements and issues a bill or credit for the full amount  after considering amounts paid by the tenants during the year 
the differences between the amounts billed  less previously received payments and the accrual adjustments  are recorded as increases or decreases to cost recovery income when the final bills are prepared  usually beginning in march and completed by june 
final adjustments for the year ended december  have not yet been determined 
at december  the company had recorded in accounts receivables million of costs expected to be recovered from tenants during the first six months of any amounts of this outstanding receivable balance written off will be charged to bad debt expense at the end of the first six months of significant competition exists which may decrease the occupancy and rental rates of the company s properties the company competes with many commercial developers  real estate companies and major retailers 
some of these entities develop or own malls  value oriented retail properties and community shopping centers that compete for tenants 
the company faces competition for prime locations and for tenants 
new regional malls or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal 
in addition  many traditional retailers compete for the same consumers 
furthermore  retailers at the properties may face increasing competition from e commerce  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  catalog companies  direct mail  telemarketing and home shopping networks 
operations could be affected if the company loses key management personnel the executive officers of the company have substantial experience in owning  operating  managing  acquiring and developing shopping centers 
success depends in large part upon the efforts of these executives  and the company cannot guarantee that they will remain with the company 
the loss of key management personnel in leasing  finance  legal and operations could have a negative impact on operations 
in addition  there are no restrictions on the ability of these executives to compete with the company after termination of their employment 
debt financing could adversely affect performance the company had billion of combined mortgage indebtedness and credit facility borrowings outstanding as of december  of the outstanding debt  million matures during as of december   the company has borrowed million from its million secured credit facility which matures on october  a number of outstanding loans will require lump sum or balloon payments for the outstanding principal balance at maturity  and the company may finance future investments that may be structured in the same manner 
the ability to repay indebtedness at maturity or otherwise may depend on its ability either to refinance such indebtedness or to sell its properties 
if the company is unable to repay any of its debt at or before maturity  it may have to borrow against properties that are not encumbered or under its credit facility  to the extent it has availability thereunder  to make such repayments 
in addition  a lender could foreclose on the property or properties securing its debt 
this could cause the company to lose part or all of its investment  which could reduce the value of common shares and the distributions payable 
fourteen of the company s properties are pledged as security for repayment of mortgage indebtedness or indebtedness under its credit facility 
the company s board of trustees has unlimited authority to increase the amount of debt the company may incur the board of trustees determines financing objectives and the amount of the indebtedness the company may incur and makes revisions at any time without a shareholder s vote 
although the trustees have no present intention to change these objectives  revisions could result in a more highly leveraged company with an increased risk of default on indebtedness and an increase in debt service charges 
the company may also  without shareholder vote  continue to use leverage through borrowing under its credit facility and on its unencumbered properties to increase the number and size of its investments 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents in the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of cam  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company uses interest rate protection agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with long term  floating rate debt 
at december  and approximately and  respectively  of the company s debt  after giving effect to interest rate protection agreements  bore interest at fixed rates with weighted average maturity of years and years  respectively  and weighted average interest rates of approximately and  respectively 
the remainder of the company s debt at december  and  bears interest at variable rates with weighted average interest rates of approximately and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt excluding its credit facility was  million and  million  respectively  compared to its carrying amounts of  million and million  respectively 
the company s combined future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  primarily libor 
based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december  and  a basis points increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million and million  respectively  and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million and million  at the respective balance sheet dates 
a basis points decrease in the market rates of interest would increase future earnings and cash flows by million and million  respectively  and increase the fair value of debt by approximately million and million  at the respective balance sheet dates 
the company has entered into certain cap and floor agreements  which impact this analysis at certain libor rate levels see notes and to the consolidated financial statements
