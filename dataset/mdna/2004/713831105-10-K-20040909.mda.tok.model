item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act if  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including any statements regarding projections of earnings  revenues  gross margins or other financial items  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future purchases of capital equipment  future expenditures  potential acquisitions  proposed new products or services and their development schedule  industry  technological or market trends  our ability to address the need for application specific logic products  our ability to respond rapidly to customer needs  expanding product sales  future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward looking statements will prove to be correct  and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein under the heading risk factors factors that may affect operating results in item of this report and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgements and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
estimated costs for sales returns  price protection  stock rotation and other allowances are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the period that sales are recognized 
domestic and international distributors are permitted to return up to of their net purchases once every six months 
approximately of our sales are to distributors 
we have agreements for price adjustment and stock rotation programs with our distributors 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgements and estimates 
our estimates are based on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period 
table of contents of time 
actual market conditions in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially impacting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
investments 
pericom adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for its fiscal year beginning july  accordingly  we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value of  and annual amortization of  that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually 
we determined that no impairment of this goodwill existed in fiscal  and we will continue to evaluate such goodwill at least annually 
other than the saronix acquisition  we did not make investments in fiscal investments are included in other long term assets in our balance sheet and are carried at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
overview pericom semiconductor corporation was incorporated in june we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and frequency control products used for the transfer  routing  and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
since then we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  volt bit logic circuits and bit digital switches  in fiscal  clock generators  volt clock synthesizers and buffers  and high speed interface products for the networking industry in fiscal in fiscal  bit logic  bit digital switches and pentium  k modem and laser printer clock synthesizers  in fiscal  an analog switch family  mixed voltage logic and a family of clock generators  in fiscal  a family of advanced volt cmos logic  timing devices for pentium and pentium ii mobile computers  a complete solution for the pc memory module standard  and a volt bus switch family offering the fastest bus switches on the market  in fiscal  three families of volt zero delay clock drivers for the networking and telecommunications markets  a family of application specific bus switches and integrated clock generators to support the latest intel processors and a complete interface solution for the pc memory module standard  in fiscal  a crossbar switch for backplane applications like server clusters  networking  industrial computing and storage area networks  a family of drivers  receivers  and transceivers supporting the low voltage differential signaling interface standard  the superclock programmable skew timing product family targeting networking  telecommunications and storage area network applications  a complete interface solution for the new double data rate ddr sdram memory standard  a family of lvds cross point switches to route signals in oc networks  and the avc family of high speed interface logic  in fiscal  a volt switch products and complementary complete timing interface solution for use in double data rate ddr synchronous dram modules  lvds products for the networking market including both dual and quad crosspoint switches for both point to point and bus communications  
table of contents several hot plug switches that support the growing demand for operations  expansion of the volt avc family  and low voltage bus switch products that provide volt to volt and volt to volt level translation  in fiscal  advanced avc products that allow voltage shifting between volts and volts and i o translation from hstl to lvttl commonly needed between the latest state of the art asics and other legacy products  enhancements to our ddr memory module solutions  active termination clamp that help to clean up signaling overshoot common at fast clock rates  additional family of seven analog multiplexers and switches with improved performance  which are used in a wide range of space constrained mobile and handheld computing applications  and a family of single  dual  and triple gate logic devices in extremely small packaging that address a very broad range of applications and systems requirements  and in fiscal  a family of intel compatible pci bridge products that offer higher margins  v low r on ohm general purpose switches  support for ddr i at mhz and mhz plus our first ddr ii products  gigabit lan switch used in notebook computers  vcxo for set top boxes and dsl products  and we expanded our standard logic product line 
in fiscal  the company expanded its bridge product line to include enhanced features  higher performance and to support the pci x bus 
it brought to market low voltage analog switches with r on of ohms 
application specific nd generation gigibit lan switches and usb switches were introduced to the customer base 
supervisory products including watchdog timers and reset circuits premiered from pericom 
during the year  saronix was acquired bringing high performance frequency control products to our comprehensive product portfolio 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
we seek to increase unit sales volume through increased wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualification of new foundries  increased number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improved yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
chartered semiconductor manufacturing manufactured approximately   and of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we qualified tsmc in fiscal  hyundai hynix in fiscal and smic in fiscal declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economies of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing  and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss comparison of fiscal  and net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net revenues was due to the october  saronix acquisition that contributed million to the year over year gain and the general semiconductor industry recovery during the period resulting in an increased volume of units shipped 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues resulted primarily from a rapid decline in weighted average selling prices and continued reductions of inventory levels in the distribution and contract manufacturing sales channels as a result of the ongoing worldwide semiconductor industry downturn 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to improved semiconductor product mix and revenue growth and the october  saronix acquisition 
the increase in gross margin percentage was due to improvements in the mix of semiconductor products sold and cost reductions  partially offset by saronix margins that are somewhat lower than the ic margins 
fiscal gross profit and gross margin also benefited from the sale of previously written off inventory totaling  gross profit decreased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a revenue decrease offset by significant nonrecurring inventory write downs recorded in fiscal that were not repeated in fiscal excluding the inventory write down in fiscal  product margins actually declined from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to declines in weighted average selling prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was due to million of expenses relating to the acquired operations of saronix and  was due to growth at pericom taiwan limited 
as a percentage of revenues research and development expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to our increase in net revenues and to the october  saronix acquisition offset in part by increased research and development activity at pericom taiwan limited 
research and development expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the reduction in net revenues 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to million of expenses relating to the acquired operations of saronix 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the increase in our net revenues and offset by expenses added by the october  saronix acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal but increased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the expense decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels and the percent decrease was due to the reduction in net revenues in fiscal the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods over the long term due to increased staffing levels  particularly in sales and marketing  as well as increased commission expense to the extent the company achieves higher sales levels 
in the short term  the company intends to continue to focus on controlling costs until business conditions significantly improve 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our goals  the company may implement further cost cutting actions 
restructuring charge 
in fiscal there was a restructuring charge of  related to an unused leased facility 
in fiscal there was a restructuring charge of million related to another unused leased facility 
we believe that these restructuring charges  along with those recorded previously  are sufficient to cover the costs of these facilities through the terms of their leases 
there were no restructuring charges in fiscal other income  net 
other income  net includes interest income and expense  investment write offs and recovery and our allocated portion of the net income loss of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china 
pti was formed by pericom and certain pericom shareholders in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries see note of notes to financial statements 
other income  net  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a pti profit increase and a lack of investment write offs  as offset by a decrease in interest income 
interest income declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to declines in short term interest rates 
our share of the net profits or losses of pti increased to a profit of  in fiscal from a loss of  in fiscal as the market conditions in china continued to improve 
we had no investment write offs in fiscal  while we wrote off investments totaling million in fiscal other income  net increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to declines in short term interest rates 
our share of the net losses of pti decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal as the market conditions in china have improved 
in addition  we wrote off investments totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared with a benefit of million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower net operating losses in fiscal partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal the income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared with a benefit of million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower net operating losses 
the provision for income taxes differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the utilization of research and development tax credits and a change in the deferred asset valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million as compared with million as of june  the company s net cash used in operating activities of  in fiscal was primarily due to net losses of million  a million increase in deferred income taxes and a million increase in inventories partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million and an increase to accounts 
table of contents payable of million 
these are net of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of saronix llc described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to the growth in our operation 
the company s cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to net losses of million offset by depreciation and amortization of million  and other than temporary decline in the value of investments of million and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the company s cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to net losses of million and a million increase in deferred income taxes partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million  other than temporary decline in the value of investments of million  equity in net loss of pericom technology  inc of million  a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable and increase to inventory was due to the significant decline of our revenue in fiscal while inventory purchases were based on sales expectations that were higher than what was achieved 
the company s cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases by million partially offset by loans to saronix of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
the company s cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to million of purchases of property and equipment  loans provided to saronix of million and an investment of approximately million increase in other assets which was partially offset by maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases by million 
the company s cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was due to purchases of short term investment exceeding maturities by million  purchases of property and equipment of million and investments in the common stock of private companies of million 
the company s cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to the sale of common stock from the company s employee stock plans 
the company s cash used in financing activities in fiscal of  due to the repurchase of common stock by the company of million  which was offset by proceeds received from the sale of common stock from the company s employee stock plans of million 
the company s cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was due to the sale of common stock from the company s employee stock plans 
the company s board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
as of june   the company has repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
no shares were repurchased during fiscal as of august   the company had repurchased  shares at an approximate cost of million 
the company intends to continue repurchasing shares under this program over time depending upon price and share availability 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
management believes that existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund necessary purchases of capital equipment and to provide working capital at least through the next twelve months 
however  future events may require the company to seek additional capital sooner 
if the company determines that it needs to seek additional capital  the company may not be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to it

on the our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at june   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
