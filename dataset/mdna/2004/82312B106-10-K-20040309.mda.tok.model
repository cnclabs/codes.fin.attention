for additional information on the company s business segments  see note to audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the company participates in the telecommunications industry  which requires substantial investment in fixed assets or plant 
this significant capital requirement may preclude profitability during the initial years of operation 
the strategy of the company is to grow and diversify the business by adding services and geographic areas that can leverage the existing plant  but to do so within the opportunities and constraints presented by the industry 
for many years the company focused on reducing reliance on the regulated telephone operation  which up until was the primary business within the company 
this initial diversification was concentrated in other wireline businesses  such as the cable television and regional fiber facility businesses  but in the company made its first significant investment in the wireless sector through its former investment in the virginia rsa limited partnership 
by  revenues of the regulated telephone operation had decreased to of total revenues 
in that same year more than of the company s total revenue was generated by wireline operations  and initiatives were already underway to make wireless a more significant contributor to total revenues 
during the s significant investments were made in the cellular and pcs wireless businesses 
the va rsa cellular operation  in which the company held a interest and was the general partner  experienced rapid revenue growth and excellent margins in the late s 
the cellular operation covered only six counties  and became increasingly dependent on roaming revenues 
management believed the roaming revenues and associated margins would be unsustainable as other wireless providers increasingly offered nationally branded services with significantly reduced usage charges 
to position it to participate in the newer  more advanced  digital wireless services  in the company entered the pcs business through an affiliation with american personal communications apc  initiating service along the interstate corridor from harrisonburg  virginia to chambersburg  pennsylvania 
this territory was a very close match to the company s fiber network  thereby providing economic integration that might not be available to other wireless carriers 
in  the company entered a new affiliation arrangement with sprint  the successor to apc which introduced the company to a nationally branded wireless service and expanded the pcs footprint further into central pennsylvania 
the company s combined capital investment in and in the pcs operation was million 
the wireless industry in the late s became increasingly competitive and the company was not immune to these industry issues 
the clear paysm program  introduced by sprint as a no deposit offering in  attracted high credit risk customers in the company s markets 
as the results began to materialize  the company implemented deposits on this program mid april  and experienced high levels of customer turnover churn and uncollectable accounts 
the write offs of uncollectable accounts peaked in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of there was some evidence that the strengthened credit policy was having a favorable impact 
nonetheless  the net loss in the pcs operation was million  as compared to million in despite the disappointing financial results for  the pcs customer base grew by over 
while the pcs operation was adding customers  the cellular operation continued to lose its local customer base 
the growing belief that national branding was critical to our wireless operations  the expectation that roaming revenues from our analog cellular operation would not continue to grow  and the increase in the number of wireless competitors in our markets  prompted the company to exit the cellular business in order to focus on our pcs operations 
the company entered into an agreement on november   to sell its ownership interest in the virginia rsa cellular operation which was classified as a discontinued operation 
the closing occurred february  the company received million in proceeds  including million in escrow for two years and million for working capital 
in many respects  was a successful year 
churn and levels of uncollectable accounts in the pcs operation returned to more acceptable levels 
pcs revenues reached million  and total revenues reached million 
the pcs operation recognized a small profit for the year  including favorable adjustments associated with settlement of disputed items with sprint 
excluding the favorable adjustments  the pcs operation recognized a profit in the fourth quarter 
with improved operating cash flow and reduced capital spending in  the company prepaid million in debt  selecting those notes with nominal prepayment penalties 
additionally  after receiving the cash and paying taxes on the gain of the sale of the virginia partnership interest  the company invested the remaining proceeds in liquid financial instruments  available for future deployment 
additionally  the company has been successful at decreasing its dependency on wireline revenues 
wireline revenues  at million in compared to million in  were of total revenues in compared to in entering  the company is pleased with the milestone of a profitable quarter in the pcs operation  but recognizes that much work remains to ultimately earn a reasonable return on this investment 
the recently announced signing of an addendum to the management and services agreements with sprint is expected to lead to cost savings and greater certainty in fees paid to sprint 
however  the consolidation predicted for the wireless industry in recent years  including the recently announced cingular att deal and anticipated improvements in the overall economics of wireless services  has not yet materialized 
future sprint marketing efforts  designed to meet the competition  could potentially have an unfavorable impact on the company and lead to additional losses 
the risks associated with the sprint pcs affiliation are described in further detail elsewhere in this document 
the company is now reviewing alternatives for other businesses to further diversify our revenue base  from either a services platform or a geographic concentration

on a normalized basis  the th quarter pcs travel revenue per subscriber would be and pcs ccpu would be approximately taking into account the adjustments and true ups recorded in december significant transactions the company had several significant transactions during the largest was the sale of its interest in the virginia rsa cellular operation  as described above 
the company originally entered into the agreement with verizon wireless in november the company was the general partner of the limited partnership which operated an analog cellular network in the six county area of northwestern virginia  including clarke  frederick  page  rappahannock  shenandoah  and warren counties  and the city of winchester 
the sales price was million plus the company s share of the partnership s working capital  which was approximately million 
the company was required to do a working capital true up following the closing  from which the company recorded a charge for thousand after taxes 
in the fourth quarter the company recorded an additional charge for taxes of million to reflect the consolidated effective tax rate based on the final operating results for the year 
the sale of this business is reflected in the discontinued operations section of the income statement along with the results of operations for the two months of that the operation remained a part of the company 
reflected in the results are several unusual items  which should be noted in understanding the financial results of the company for certain access revenue rate elements billed by the company to interexchange carriers were disputed and subsequently refunded to the carriers 
during  the company recorded a reduction in access revenue of million from interexchange customers related to the disputed access revenue the company previously billed for switching facilities and the local exchange network 
the disputes cover a two year period beginning in through and including the second quarter of the total amount of the reduction related to was million 
the company changed its employee vacation policy so that employees now earn and use their vacation benefits in the same year 
previously  vacation benefits were earned in the year prior to the year the benefits were available to the employee 
as a result of this change in employee benefit policy  the company did not accrue employee vacation expense for in  thereby reducing its benefit expenses by million for the year 
the company adjusted its estimate of deferred revenue for the pcs operation in the fourth quarter of the adjustment decreased deferred revenue by million and increased revenue in by the same amount 
the company received a reimbursement from sprint of million related to for its portion of the e surcharge collected from pcs subscribers 
the reimbursement is to offset the company s portion of handset costs incurred to make the customers phones e compliant 
this entry decreased cost of goods expenses 
on january   the company  a pcs affiliate of sprint  signed agreements with sprint that resolved disputed items and documented changes in the management and operating agreements between the two companies related to the operations of the nationwide sprint pcs network 
the agreements provide the company with the ability to better estimate the future costs of certain operating expenses and in the company s opinion improve the contract between sprint and itself 
under the agreements sprint agreed to compensate the company for lost travel revenue related to usage by sprint customers in the company s territory for the period prior to  and change the method of allocating certain software maintenance fees between sprint and its affiliates for fees recorded in and these items had the effect of increasing operating income by million in the th quarter of the method used to price certain services performed by sprint on behalf of the company was simplified 
the ccpu cash cost per user rate for the periods through was set at per user per month 
this fee covers customer service  billing  collections  network operations and other costs to support the customer 
however  sprint may discontinue such services if sprint is discontinuing such services to all other sprint pcs affiliates and sprint s own end users 
it is estimated that this rate will decrease the amount the company will pay sprint compared to payments under the previous method by approximately  per month in there will be a maximum until the year  on the non direct costs per gross additions cpga at the greater of of the sprint published cpga rate or with the volatility of cpga  the company cannot determine the amount of potential savings  but the change does provide more certainty in estimating future costs 
for the period through  the travel and reseller rates between the company and sprint were set at per minute for voice and per kilobyte for data 
without this agreement the voice travel rate for would have decreased to 
since the company is in a net receivable position related to travel with sprint  the impact on net travel and reseller revenue would have been a reduction of million had the rate been in effect in beginning in  the sprint travel and reseller rate will be changed annually to equal of sprint s retail yield from the prior year 
sprint s retail yield will be determined based on sprint s average revenue per pcs user for voice services divided by the average minutes of use per user 
sprint and the company will agree on a service level agreement related to the provision of customer services by december  if sprint does not reach the stated goals  the company will have the opportunity to either provide the services itself or contract with a third party  beginning in through  a methodology is provided to determine if the company is required to make certain capital expenditures and participate in sprint national marketing programs 
effective january   the method of cash settlement provided for under the agreement changed from sprint distributing cash from customers based on collected revenue to billed revenue 
the absolute amount of cash received by the company should remain the same  but the company should receive cash on a more timely basis 
the company is entitled to a most favored nations clause 
during the period through  the company will have the opportunity to adopt any addendum to the management and or service agreements that sprint signs with another pcs affiliate 
in may  the board of directors of the company adopted a nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp benefit for named executives 
the plan was established to provide benefits beyond the pension plan that covers all employees 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in november  the company commenced a management reorganization that will be ongoing into the reorganization was in recognition of the company s growth and changes in the telecom industry 
the company shifted from an organization structure that was focused on lines of business to a plan that organizes on function 
the company plans to expand the senior staff and corresponding departments as needed to better position itself for future opportunities 
this reorganization did not require a charge to the operation  as there were no positions lost or values impaired as a result of the reorganization 
on november   federal regulations went into effect whereby customers in the largest metropolitan areas were able to change wireless carriers and keep their phone numbers 
this is referred to as wireless local number portability wlnp 
on the same date in those markets  wireline customers could transfer their wireline number to a wireless phone 
on may   local number portability lnp will be available to wireless and wireline subscribers throughout the united states 
to date  the impact of lnp wlnp on the company has been insignificant 
summary the company s three major lines of business are wireless  wireline and other businesses 
each of the three areas has unique issues and challenges that are critical to the understanding of the operations of the company 
the wireless business is made up of two different operations  the pcs operation and the tower business 
the wireline business is made up of traditional telephone operations  a cable tv operation  fiber network leasing and a company that resells long distance 
other business includes the company s internet operation  the interstate corridor travel project and the sales and service of telecommunications systems 
the pcs operation must be understood within the context of the company s relationship with sprint and its pcs affiliates 
the company operates its pcs wireless network as an affiliate of sprint 
the company receives revenues from sprint for subscribers that obtain service in the company s network coverage area and those subscribers using the company s network when they travel 
the company relies on sprint to provide timely  accurate and complete information for the company to record the appropriate revenue and expenses for the periods reflected 
the company s pcs business has operated in a net travel receivable position for several years 
the company received million in net travel in  compared to million in  and million in this relationship could change due to service plan changes  subscriber travel habit changes and other changes beyond the control of the company 
through sprint  the company began receiving revenue from wholesale resellers of wireless pcs service in late these resellers pay a flat rate per minute of use for all traffic their subscribers generate on the company s network 
the company s cost to handle this traffic is the incremental cost to provide the necessary network capacity 
the company faces vigorous competition in the wireless business as numerous national carriers are aggressively marketing their services in the company s markets 
the competitive landscape could change significantly depending on the marketing initiatives of our competitors  or in the event of consolidation in the wireless industry 
the wireline business is made up of traditional telephony  cable tv  fiber network operations and the company s long distance resale business 
these businesses operate in a defined geographic area 
the company s primary service area for the telephone  cable tv and long distance business is shenandoah county  virginia 
the county is a rural area in northwestern virginia  with a population of approximately  inhabitants  which has increased by approximately  since the potential for significant numbers of additional customers in the current operating area is limited 
the company s telephone subscriber count declined in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter of migration to wireless and dsl services are believed to be driving this change 
based on industry experience  the company anticipates this trend may continue for the foreseeable future 
other revenues include internet services  both dial up and dsl high speed service 
the company has seen a decline in dial up subscriptions over the last year 
the dsl service has grown over in the last year driven by customer desire for faster internet connections 
the company is facing competition for revenues it generates in the other lines of business  which will require the company to differentiate itself from other providers through its service levels and evolving technologies that are more reliable and cost effective for the customer 
critical accounting policies the company relies on the use of estimates and makes assumptions that impact its financial condition and results 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results and trends as well as the company s forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
several of the most critical accounting policies that materially impact the company s results of operations include allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policies  and the analysis of the accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these estimates  the company compares historical write offs in relation to the estimated period in which the subscriber was originally billed 
the company also looks at the historical average length of time that elapses between the original billing date and the date of write off and the financial position of its larger customers in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
from this information  the company assigns specific amounts to the aging categories 
the company provides an allowance for substantially all receivables over days old 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance as of december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts is not adequate  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
the company also reviews current trends in the credit quality of the subscriber bases in its various businesses and periodically changes its credit policies 
as of december   the sprint pcs subscriber base in the company s market area consisted of sub prime credit quality subscribers compared to at december  sprint manages the accounts receivable function related to all of the company s sprint pcs wireless customers  therefore limiting the amount of control the company has in setting credit policy parameters 
the remainder of the company s receivables are associated with services provided on a more localized basis  where the company exercises total control in setting credit policy parameters 
historically there have been limited losses generated from the non pcs revenue streams 
prior to  the company had not faced significant write offs of inter carrier accounts  but due to the telecommunication industry down turn of the last few years  the company experienced write offs in this area of the business totaling million in  due to bankruptcy filings of several significant telecommunications companies 
in  the inter carrier segment of the business improved and the company recovered thousand of bad debt from the sale of certain accounts that were previously written off 
bad debt expense summary  net of recoveries for the three years ended december in thousands pcs subscribers    interexchange carriers other subscribers and entities total bad debt expense    revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s revenue recognition polices are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  and the emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
effective july  the company adopted eitf the eitf guidance addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve multiple revenue generating activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
in applying this guidance  separate contracts with the same party  entered into at or near the same time  will be presumed to be a bundled transaction  and the consideration will be measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values 
the consensus guidance was applicable to new pcs service agreements entered into for quarters beginning july  the adoption of eitf required evaluation of each arrangement entered into by the company for each sales channel 
the company will continue to monitor arrangements with its sales channels to determine if any changes in revenue recognition will need to be made in the future 
the adoption of eitf has resulted in substantially all of the pcs activation fee revenue generated through company owned retail stores and associated direct costs being recognized at the time the related wireless handset is sold and it is classified as equipment revenue and cost of equipment  respectively 
upon adoption of eitf  previously deferred pcs revenue and costs will continue to be amortized over the remaining estimated life of a subscriber  not to exceed months 
pcs revenue and costs for activations at other retail locations and through other sales channels will continue to be deferred and amortized over their estimated lives as prescribed by sab the adoption of eitf had the effect of increasing equipment revenue by thousand and increasing costs of equipment by thousand  which otherwise would have been deferred and amortized 
the company records equipment revenue from the sale of handsets and accessories to subscribers in its retail stores and to local distributors in its territories upon delivery 
the company does not record equipment revenue on handsets and accessories purchased from national third party retailers  those purchased though the company s business to business sales force  or directly from sprint by subscribers in its territories 
the company believes the equipment revenue and related cost of equipment associated with the sale of wireless handsets and accessories is a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services to subscribers 
for competitive marketing reasons  the company sells wireless handsets at prices lower than the cost 
in certain instances the company may offer larger handset discounts as an incentive for the customer to agree to a multi year service contract 
the company also sells wireless handsets to existing customers at a loss in handset sales and the corresponding cost in cost of goods  and accounts for these transactions separately from agreements to provide customers wireless service 
these transactions are viewed as a cost to retain the existing customers and deter churn 
for the company s wireless customers that purchase and activate their service through a channel not covered by eitf  the wireless customers generally pay an activation fee to the company when they initiate service 
the company defers the activation fee revenue except when a special promotion reduces or waives the fee over the average life of its subscribers  which is estimated to be months 
the company recognizes service revenue from its subscribers as they use the service 
the company provides a reduction of recorded revenue for billing adjustments and the portion of revenue that is retained by sprint 
the company also reduces recorded revenue for rebates and discounts given to subscribers on wireless handset sales in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a subscriber including a reseller of the vendor s products 
the company participates in the sprint national and regional distribution programs in which national retailers sell sprint wireless products and services 
in order to facilitate the sale of sprint wireless products and services  national retailers purchase wireless handsets from sprint for resale and receive compensation from sprint for sprint wireless products and services sold 
for industry competitive reasons  sprint subsidizes the price of these handsets by selling the handsets at a price below cost 
under the company s agreements with sprint  when a national retailer sells a handset purchased from sprint to a subscriber in the company s territories  the company is obligated to reimburse sprint for the handset subsidy 
the company does not receive any revenues from the sale of handsets and accessories by national retailers 
the company classifies these handset subsidy charges as a cost of goods expense 
through december   the agreement provided that sprint retains of collected service revenues from subscribers based in the company s markets and from non sprint wholesale subscribers who roam onto the company s network 
the amount of revenue retained by sprint is recorded as an offset to the revenues recorded 
all revenue derived from the sale of handsets and accessories by the company and from certain roaming services outbound roaming and travel revenues from sprint and its pcs affiliate subscribers are retained by the company 
the company defers direct subscriber activation costs on subscribers whose activation falls within the sab guidelines 
the activation costs are deferred when incurred  and then amortized using the straight line method over months  which is the estimated average life of a subscriber 
direct subscriber activation costs also include the activation charge from sprint  and credit check fees 
these fees are charged to the company by sprint at approximate per subscriber 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company evaluates the recoverability of tax assets generated on a state by state basis from net operating losses apportioned to that state 
management uses a more likely than not threshold to make that determination and has established a valuation allowance against the tax assets  in case they are not recoverable 
for  the company added an additional reserve of million to its valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the net operating loss carry forwards in certain states 
the valuation allowance now stands at million as of december  management will evaluate the effective rate of taxes based on apportionment factors  the company s operating results  and the various state income tax rates 
currently  management anticipates the normalized effective income tax rate to be approximately 
other the company does not have any unrecorded off balance sheet transactions or arrangements  however  the company has commitments under operating leases and is subject to certain capital calls under one of its investments 
results of continuing operations compared to total revenue was million in  an increase of million or 
total revenues included million of wireless revenues  an increase of million or  wireline revenues of million  an increase of million or  and other revenues of million  an increase of million or 
within wireless revenues  the pcs operation contributed million  an increase of million  or 
pcs service revenues were million  an increase of million or 
service revenue growth was driven by the increase in subscribers  totaling  at december   an increase of  or  compared to  subscribers at year end the company had churn of in compared to in the decline in the churn rate is the result of tightening the credit screening for new subscribers as well as continued efforts to improve the after sales support 
competition in the wireless industry continues to have a significant impact on the results of the company s pcs operation 
pcs travel revenue  including reseller revenue  which is compensation between sprint and its pcs affiliates for use of the other party s network  was million  an increase of million or 
travel revenue is impacted by the geographic size of the company s network service area  the overall number of sprint wireless customers  their travel patterns and the travel exchange rate 
the rate received on travel was per minute in  compared to per minute in as a part of the amended management agreement signed on january   sprint and the company agreed to maintain the travel rate at per minute through december  pcs equipment sales were million  an increase of million or 
the equipment sales are net of million of rebates and discounts given at the time of sale 
rebates and discounts continue to be required to meet significant industry competition for subscriber additions and subscriber retention 
these discounts and rebates are primarily transacted in the form of instant rebates  providing a second phone free when a customer purchases one  or providing free phones if the subscriber signs up for a specific contract term and a specific service plan 
in accordance with sprint s requirements  the company launched third generation g x wireless service in august g x is the first of a four stage migration path that will enable additional voice capacity and increased data speeds for subscribers 
the network upgrades completed in were software changes  channel card upgrades  and some new network elements required for packet data 
the company s base stations were outfitted with network card enhancements  thereby allowing the company to provide g x service without wholesale change outs of base stations 
g x is backwards compatible with the existing g network  thereby allowing continued use of current customer handsets 
the impact of g x network enhancements on revenues became more pronounced in  as use of new g services and features generated approximately million for the year  compared to million in the growth in g revenue is the result of more subscribers on g plans and the increase in popularity of camera phones during wireless revenues included tower leases of million  an increase of million or 
the increase was the result of other wireless carriers executing additional leases to use space on the company s portfolio of towers 
of the towers and poles owned by the company as of december   towers have one or more external tenants  compared to towers with external tenants at the end of wireless revenues from the company s paging operation were million  a decrease of million as the customer base increasingly chose alternative wireless services 
paging service subscribers declined by in from  subscribers to  subscribers 
the paging operation continues to decline as more areas are covered by wireless voice services  which have features that surpass those of paging technologies 
the company anticipates that its paging customer base will continue to decline in the future 
within wireline revenues  the telephone operation contributed million  an increase of million  or 
telephone access revenues were million  an increase of million or 
during  the company recorded a million reduction to access revenue  of which million was related to  resolving disputes with interexchange carriers on the rating of long distance calls transiting the telephone switching network for termination on wireless networks 
originating access revenue increased in due in part to a shift from interstate to intrastate traffic 
on similar traffic volume in both years  the company generated an additional million due to a favorable rate differential of per minute on the increase in the mix of intrastate traffic 
the company s increased access revenue was also a result of the benefit gained through terminating more minutes through the switch  which increased million minutes or over the rates for terminating traffic were similar in both years  although the percentage of terminating traffic to total traffic increased from in to in the shift in originating traffic is the result of implementing software capable of identifying actual interstate and intrastate traffic specifically delivered to the wireline switch  where previously usage was allocated between interstate and intrastate traffic types by the interexchange carriers 
the following table shows the access traffic minutes of use for the two years of and minutes of use in thousands net of intercompany usage originating terminating originating terminating interstate     intrastate     total     access revenue in thousands net of intercompany usage as reported pro forma as reported pro forma traffic sensitive     special access revenues     carrier common line settlement     total     traffic sensitive revenue has been normalized in the proforma column to remove the impact of the access billing dispute adjustment and the impact of the neca settlement adjustments 
facility lease revenue contributed million to wireline revenues  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily the result of the prolonged decline of lease rates associated with competitive pricing pressures and the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry 
during the company completed a second  diverse fiber route to its existing interconnection point in the dulles airport area of northern virginia 
this fiber route provides increased reliability for customers in the event of fiber cuts or breaks  and extends the availability of the company s fiber network to additional market locations but to date has not added additional revenue to the company s operation 
billing and collection services and other revenues contributed million to wireline revenues  which was the same as results 
revenues from this service had declined in recent years  with interexchange carriers now issuing a greater proportion of their bills directly to their customers 
wireline revenues from cable television services were million  an increase of million or 
the number of subscribers and service plan prices remained relatively constant during other revenues  primarily consisting of internet and virginia service revenues were million in  an increase of million or 
the company had  dial up internet subscribers at december   compared to  at the end of the previous year 
during  the company s dsl high speed internet access subscriber count increased to  from total internet service revenue was million  an increase of million or 
the virginia contract with the virginia department of transportation contributed million to other revenues  an increase of million or 
telecommunications equipment sales  services and lease revenues were million  which reflects a million decrease from results 
total operating expenses were million  an increase of million or 
the primary driver in the increase in operating expenses is continued growth in the pcs operation somewhat offset by a significant decline in bad debt expense compared to late in  the company made an employee benefits policy change  which eliminated the requirement for the company to accrue a vacation liability in advance of the year in which the benefit was used 
the result of this change was a reduction of benefit expense of million for the year compared to benefit expenses impact all operating departments based on the amount of direct labor charged to the department 
the change has a one time impact on the financial statements of the company 
the benefits policy now provides that employees earn and use their paid time off in the same period 
in the future  under this policy  unused hours can be banked but only used for extended illness  not carried over for use as vacation 
cost of goods and services was million  an increase of million or 
the pcs cost of goods sold was million  an increase of million or 
this change is due primarily to higher volumes of handsets sold through company owned stores and pcs handset subsidies paid to third party retailers 
in  the company recorded approximately million in handset costs related to existing subscribers upgrading their handsets 
prior to  the company did not track the specific costs related to subsidizing new handsets to existing customers 
the cost of handset up grades sold to existing customers is expected to increase as the customer base matures and handset manufacturers introduce new technologies in new handsets 
the cable television programming cost of service expense was million  an increase of million or 
the company has seen continuing upward pressure on the cost of cable tv programming by cable tv program providers 
network operating costs were million  an increase of million or 
the largest item in network operating costs is travel expense 
these costs made up and of the total network and other costs in and  respectively 
travel expense is the cost of minutes used by the company s pcs subscribers on sprint or other sprint affiliates networks

in  the company anticipates taking advantage of a conversion feature on its rural telephone bank stock

the range of the dividend has been between and over the last years 
the rate in the two most recent years was 
this transaction is estimated to provide the company with approximately million in dividend income each year  based on the dividend rate of and assuming we had converted the stock at the beginning of financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company has four principal sources of funds available to meet the financing needs of its operations  capital projects  debt service  investments and potential dividends 
these sources include cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents  the liquidation of investments and borrowings 
management routinely considers the alternatives available to determine what mix of sources are best suited for the long term benefit of the company 
during the year  with the closing of the sale of the virginia rsa limited partnership interest  the company evaluated its capital requirements  and as a result eliminated its million revolving line of credit with cobank in may the company had paid off the outstanding balance in early  and did not borrow on it during the remaining time the facility was in place 
in light of the million balance in cash equivalent investments  management determined additional debt capacity is not necessary for the near term 
the term debt loan agreements with cobank have three financial covenants 
these are measured on a trailing month basis and are calculated on continuing operations 
the first of the covenants is the total leverage ratio  which is total debt to operating cash flow 
this ratio must remain below  and as of december  it was the second measure is equity to total assets  which must be or higher 
at december  the ratio was 
the third measure is the debt service coverage ratio  which is operating cash flow to scheduled debt service  which must exceed at december  this measure was management believes the company will meet these covenant measures for the coming year 
the company has pledged all of its affiliates capital stock as collateral for the cobank loans 
the company s covenants on the rus rtb debt require the pledge of all current and future assets of the telephone subsidiary until the debt is retired 
another external source of funding is a million unsecured  variable rate revolving line of credit with suntrust bank 
this facility is in place to allow the company to better manage its daily cash balances 
the facility expires may  management anticipates renewing this facility with suntrust bank under similar terms and conditions 
at december  there were no balances outstanding under this facility 
due to make whole provisions in the company s debt agreements it is currently uneconomical for the company to prepay any debt 
the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts it has entered into  including amounts pursuant to its various long term debt facilities  and non cancelable operating lease agreements for retail space  tower space and cell sites 
expected future minimum contractual cash obligations for the next five years and in the aggregate at december   are as follows payments due by periods less than unaudited in thousands total year years years after years long term debt principal      interest on long term debt      operating leases      capital calls on investments   purchase obligations total obligations      the million placed in escrow  as part of the sales agreement on the virginia rsa limited partnership  should be released after february  there are no known claims that have been filed against the amount in escrow

the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements and has not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
capital expenditures budgeted for total approximately million  including approximately million for additional pcs base stations  additional towers  and switch upgrades to enhance the pcs network 
improvements and replacements of approximately million are planned for the telephone operation 
the remaining million covers building renovations  vehicles  office equipment  and other miscellaneous capital needs 
the company anticipates using funds from operations  to the extent they are available to fund the capital expenditures and the payment of debt and interest 
due to lower than expected tax expenses in  the company will apply the tax receivable to the year tax liability 
it is anticipated by no later than second quarter of  additional federal tax payments will be due based on anticipated profits expected to be generated in the operation 
management anticipates its operations will generate similar operating cash flows in  compared to those of continuing operations in  although there are events outside the control of the company that could have an adverse impact on cash flows from operations 
the events that could adversely impact operating cash flow results include  but are not limited to  changes in overall economic conditions  regulatory requirements  changes in technologies  availability of labor resources and capital  and other conditions 
the pcs subsidiary s operations are dependent upon sprint s ability to execute certain functions such as billing  customer care  and collections  their ability to develop and implement successful marketing programs and new products and services  and their ability to effectively and economically manage other operating activities under the company s agreements with sprint 
additionally  the company s ability to attract and maintain a sufficient customer base is critical to maintaining a positive cash flow from operations 
these items individually and or collectively could impact the company s results 
the company expects to generate adequate cash to meet its short term and long term cash needs  including working capital requirements  capital projects and debt payments  and to fund potential dividend payments from cash on hand  operating cash flow  and amounts expected to be available under the company s existing financing facilities and its anticipated financing facilities discussed above 
the company may  at its election  liquidate some of its investments to generate additional cash for its capital needs as market conditions allow 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
the company is evaluating the impact of applying fin r to existing vies in which it has variable interests and does not believe the application will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

the company is dependent on sprint for the reporting of a significant majority of pcs revenues  particularly travel and service revenue 
controls and processes are continually refined  so the company can monitor  review  test  and validate information being reported to the company by sprint 
it is the company s policy to estimate and reflect the information supplied by sprint in the financial statements in the respective periods 
corrections  if any  are made no earlier than the period in which the parties agree to the corrections and as noted in these financial statements  there are several dispute settlements  true ups of estimates and corrections which are recorded in the period the issue has been resolved 
the company is at risk for reporting errors that may be made by sprint 
the net balance of pcs travel revenue and expense could change significantly due to changes in service plan offerings  changes in the travel settlement rate  changes in travel habits by the subscribers in the company s market areas or other sprint subscribers and numerous other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is continuing to monitor the financial strength of the other pcs affiliates of sprint  as to their ability to maintain their segment of the sprint network may impact the ability of the company to add new subscribers 
two other sprint pcs affiliates are currently operating under bankruptcy protection 
wireless local number portability wlnp permits a subscriber to change wireless service providers in the same market area while retaining their existing telephone number 
this federal communications commission mandate was effective november  in the largest metropolitan areas and will be effective in all areas of the united states on may  although the initial impact of wlnp appears to be insignificant  there may be a significant future impact to the company s operation 
as a result of wlnp  portions of the pcs subscriber base may migrate to other wireless providers  thereby contributing to increased churn 
alternatively  the implementation of wlnp may allow the company to attract additional subscribers from other wireless providers 
the company has limited control over the service plans and marketing promotions offered to sprint customers in the competitive wireless telecommunications industry 
sprint controls the marketing plans  advertising message and market promotions offered in the company s market area 
as a result  the plans and promotions offered may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company relies on sprint for the development of new products and services to remain competitive in the wireless industry 
examples of these services are text messaging  video  and push to talk walkie talkie features 
if these services do not work properly or if sprint should not continue to develop new competitive products  the results could have a material adverse impact on the results of the company 
the company is required to participate in national and regional third party distribution programs formulated and negotiated by sprint 
sprint has entered into reseller agreements which may impact the company 
these distribution and reseller programs may have an adverse effect on the results of the company 
the company s pcs network is part of sprint s nationwide wireless network

the current competitive nature of the wireless industry may prompt major wireless providers to strive for financial improvements through industry consolidation 
such consolidation could include sprint

the company s access revenue may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory actions that decrease access rates or exempt certain traffic from paying access to the company s regulated telephone network 
the federal communications commission is currently reviewing the issue of voice over internet protocol voip as it relates to access charges 
an unfavorable finding may have an adverse effect on the company s telephone operations 
there has been a trend for incumbent local exchange carriers to see a decrease in access lines due to the effect of wireless and wireline competition  a slow down in the economy  and the elimination of a second line dedicated to dial up internet as customers migrate to broadband connections 
although the company has not seen a material reduction in its number of access lines to date  it experienced line decreases in each of the last two quarters 
there is a significant risk that this trend could have a material adverse effect on the company s telephone operations in the future 
on may   local number portability lnp will be required in the company s local wireline service area 
the company s customers will be able to retain their existing wireline phone number and use it to obtain service from a competing wireline or wireless provider in the service area 
at this time  the company cannot estimate the potential impact on its telephone operations 
if a significant number of customers disconnect the company s service  it will have an adverse impact on the company s telephone operating results 
the company s revenue from fiber leases may be adversely impacted by further erosion in demand or in price competition for these facilities 
there is also the potential for additional bankruptcies of the company s customers 
the company monitors each of its fiber lease customers closely to minimize the risk related to this business

the company may not be able to utilize all of its net operating loss carry forwards for taxes in certain states before they expire  resulting in the company writing off some of its deferred tax assets and impacting its cash position 
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
as of the end of the period covered by this report  december  the evaluation date  we carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
based upon that evaluation  the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 
under our agreements with sprint  sprint provides us with billing  collections  customer care  certain network operations and other back office services 
as a result  sprint remits to the company approximately of the company s total revenues 
in addition  approximately of the expenses reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements relate to charges by or through sprint for expenses such as billing  collections and customer care  roaming expense  long distance  and travel 
due to this relationship  the company necessarily relies on sprint to provide accurate  timely and sufficient data and information to properly record our revenues  expenses and accounts receivable  which underlie a substantial portion of our periodic financial statements and other financial disclosures 
information provided by sprint includes reports regarding the subscriber accounts receivable in our markets 
sprint provides us monthly accounts receivable  billing and cash receipts information on a market level  rather than a subscriber level 
we review these various reports to identify discrepancies or errors 
however  under our agreements with sprint  we are entitled to only a portion of the receipts  net of items such as taxes  government surcharges  certain allocable write offs and the of revenue retained by sprint 
because of our reliance on sprint for financial information  we must depend on sprint to design adequate internal controls with respect to the processes established to provide this data and information to the company and sprint s other network partners 
to address this issue  sprint engages its independent auditors to perform a periodic evaluation of these controls and to provide a report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for affiliates under guidance provided in statement of auditing standards no 
sas reports 
the report is provided to us annually and covers a twelve month period from october  to september  this report did not indicate there were issues which would adversely impact the information used to support the recording of the revenues and expenses provided by sprint related to our relationship with them 
we believe the processes we have put into place over the course of the year have steadily improved our ability to identify material errors in sprint financial information on a timely basis 
as a result of the improved processes and procedures we are continuing to develop and define  the company is committed to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its improvements in controls related to information provided by sprint and to continue to improve these processes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates on instruments held for other than trading purposes 
our interest rate risk involves three components  although only one is of any significance at this time 
the first component is outstanding debt with variable rates 
as of december   the company s variable rate debt balance was zero 
the company has a variable rate line of credit totaling million with suntrust banks 
the company s remaining debt has fixed rates through its maturity 
a decline in interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million  while the estimated current fair value of the fixed rate debt is approximately million 
the second component of interest rate risk is temporary excess cash  primarily invested in overnight repurchase agreements and short term certificates of deposit and money market funds 
the company currently has approximately million of cash equivalents in money market funds  which are earning rates of approximately per year 
the cash is currently in short term investment vehicles that have limited interest rate risk 
management continues to evaluate the most beneficial use of these funds 
the third component of interest rate risk is marked increases in interest rates which may adversely impact the rate at which the company may borrow funds for growth in the future 
although this risk is real  it is not significant at this time as the company has adequate cash for operations  payment of debt and near term capital projects 
management does not view market risk as having a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although future results could be adversely impacted if interest rates were to escalate markedly and the company required external financing 
since the company does not currently have significant investments in publicly traded stock  currently there is limited risk related to the company s available for sale securities 
general economic conditions impacted by regulatory changes  competition or other external influences may play a higher risk to the company s overall results 
as of december   the company has million invested in privately held companies directly or through investments with portfolio managers 
most of the companies are early stage and significant increases in interest rates could have an adverse impact on their results  ability to raise capital and viability 
the company s market risk is limited to the funds previously invested and an additional million committed under contracts the company has signed with portfolio managers
