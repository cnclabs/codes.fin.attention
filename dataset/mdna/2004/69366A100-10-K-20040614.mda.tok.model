the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations by reviewing the customer s current financial information 
a credit review is performed on new customers in the physician business and an annual credit review is performed on all major customers in the elder care business 
at a minimum  each elder care customer account is reviewed annually 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted which will impact general and administrative expenses and accounts receivable 
two events took place during the three months ended december  which caused the elder care business to review the method for establishing its allowance for doubtful accounts 
first  changes to medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates became effective 
refer to risk factors for a discussion of the recent reimbursement changes 
these changes are expected to positively impact the financial condition of elder care providers and the financial strength of the elder care industry 
second  management analyzed the past two years of accounts receivable collection and write off history and the current projected bad debt write offs for its elder care customers 
based on the results of this analysis  combined with the changes to the reimbursement rates  management concluded that the current methodology for establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts resulted in  and would continue to result in  an overstatement of the reserve requirement 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  management revised the estimates used to establish the allowance for doubtful accounts for the elder care business 
this change in estimate reduced the reserve percentages applied to various aging categories of accounts receivable  to more closely reflect actual collection and write off history that the company has experienced and expects to experience in the future 
the impact of reducing the reserve percentages was approximately million  net of the benefit for income taxes  or basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended april  no changes were made to the methodology subsequent to december  
table of contents inventory valuation inventories  which primarily consist of medical products and supplies and diagnostic equipment  are valued at the lower of cost  or market on a first in  first out basis 
as part of this valuation process  excess and slow moving inventories are reduced to estimated net realizable value 
the company s accounting for excess and slow moving inventory contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate when the inventory will be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
when preparing these estimates  management considers and reviews historical results  inventory quantities on hand  current operating trends  sales forecasts  and slow movement reports 
these estimates can be affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  supply interruption by a manufacturer  and other factors affecting demand for the company s inventory 
any adjustments to the valuation of inventory will impact cost of goods sold and inventory 
during fiscal year  the physician business recorded a million charge to cost of goods sold for a discontinued product line 
during fiscal year  candela corporation candela terminated a distribution agreement between the two companies and the company filed an arbitration proceeding with the american arbitration association against candela pss world medical  inc d b a physician sales service  claimant  v 
candela corporation  respondent for breach of contract  promissory estoppel  intentional interference with contractual advantageous relations  and violation of the massachusetts unfair business practices act 
candela filed counterclaims in the arbitration for breach of contract  seeking payment of million in outstanding invoices  which was recorded in accounts payable at the time of purchase  and alleged trademark infringement and violation of the massachusetts unfair business practices act 
the arbitrators ruled in favor of candela on may  due to the termination of the distribution agreement  including termination of manufacturer support  installation services  and warranty coverage  the physician business recorded an additional million charge to cost of goods sold during fiscal year estimating accruals for vendor rebates the company receives transaction based and performance based rebates from third party vendors 
such rebates are classified as either i a reduction to cost of goods sold  ii a reduction of the cost incurred  or iii an increase to net sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
performance based rebates are typically measured against inventory purchases from the manufacturer or sales volume levels and are received from the vendors at the time certain performance measures are achieved 
performance based rebates for contracts entered into subsequent to november  are recognized based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the company toward earning the rebate or refund  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimatable 
therefore  management uses judgment and estimates to determine the amount of performance based rebates to recognize each period 
if the amounts are not probable and reasonably estimable  rebate income is recognized upon achieving the performance measure 
prior to november   rebate income was recognized in the period in which the performance measure was achieved 
vendor rebates are recognized in income only if the related inventory has been sold 
therefore  management estimates the amount of vendor rebate income related to inventory not sold and establishes a reserve on a quarterly basis 
if the facts and circumstances used by management to assess whether the performance targets will be achieved by the company or the amount of inventory that has been sold change  the financial condition and the results of operations could materially change period to period 
estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets the liability method is used for determining income taxes  under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely 
table of contents than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers and makes judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets generally depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
the company s tax filings are subjected to audit by the irs 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
management believes that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of tax law 
resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  i the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by federal  state  and local tax authorities  ii the willingness of federal  state  and local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  and iii the impartiality of the federal  state  and local courts 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
during fiscal year  the company sold the international business which generated a capital loss carryforward 
at the time of sale  management believed it was more likely than not that the company would be unable to use the capital loss before its expiration in fiscal year therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded 
however  based on recent tax court rulings  the company has subsequently filed a refund claim during the three months ended december  with the irs to report an ordinary worthless stock deduction on the sale of the international business 
the filing reflects a reclassification of the nondeductible capital loss to a tax deductible ordinary loss 
this claim has been formally denied by the irs as part of the audit of fiscal years ended march  and march   therefore  the valuation allowance related to this item remains unchanged at april  the claim has been combined with the formal protest to the results of the audit and has been received by the appeals office of the irs 
the company is currently waiting notification of the initial meeting with the irs 
if the company is successful in defending its claim filed with the irs in appeals  the valuation allowance would be reversed against the provision for income taxes  which will reduce the provision for income taxes by approximately million during the year in which the final ruling is obtained 
estimating useful lives of property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives 
useful life equipment to years computer hardware and software to years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives 
management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model  or changes in the company s business strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of property and equipment could also result in shortened useful lives 
during fiscal years   and  the company revised the useful lives of certain assets in accordance with apb and recorded accelerated depreciation of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
currently  management does not expect accelerated depreciation during fiscal year to be material 

table of contents legal contingencies as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimatable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
management  with the assistance of outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and whether the amount of potential loss is estimatable 
the determination is based upon potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe the outstanding legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions related to the anticipated or actual outcome of the outstanding legal proceedings 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on march  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit annually on the last day of each fiscal year  which is the friday closest to march the physician business and the elder care business are separate reporting units 
goodwill was not impaired during fiscal years and as a result of adopting sfas  the imaging business recorded an impairment charge during fiscal year of million  net of a benefit for income taxes of million  which is included in the total loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
the impairment and disposal of long lived assets is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and iii significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable during fiscal year business combinations the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the company obtains valuations from an independent third party to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing acquired intangible assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from 
table of contents existing customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates  or other actual results 
accounting for discontinued operations on september   the company s board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of the imaging business  reflecting a strategic decision by management to focus the company s efforts on its physician and elder care businesses  which offer attractive opportunities for growth and profitability 
on november   the company completed the sale of di to imaging acquisition corporation the buyer  a wholly owned subsidiary of platinum equity  llc  a private equity firm platinum 
the sale was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated as of october   among the company  the buyer  and platinum  as amended on november  the stock purchase agreement 
under the stock purchase agreement  the purchase price was million less i an adjustment for any change in net asset value from the initial net asset value target date and ii an adjustment for any change in the net cash from the initial net cash target date purchase price 
the cash proceeds received during fiscal year  net of these adjustments  received from the buyer were approximately million 
the estimated loss on disposal is subject to change based on the final purchase price adjustments that will be recorded in the period in which they become known 
the results of operations of the imaging business and the estimated loss on disposal have been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the accompanying financial statements have been restated to conform to discontinued operations treatment for all historical periods presented 
on march   the company received a letter from the buyer claiming a purchase price adjustment of million 
the claimed purchase price adjustment is based on an accounting of the net asset statement as of the closing date  which was delivered to the buyer in january pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement  the matter has been referred to an independent accounting firm of national reputation for binding resolution 
subsequent to march   the buyer has provided an adjusted claim to the arbitrator claiming a purchase price adjustment of million 
the company is currently in the process of responding to information requests from the arbitrator 
the company intends to defend vigorously against these claims  however  there can be no assurance that this claim will be ultimately resolved on terms that are favorable to the company 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors the company s net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of many factors  including fluctuating demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new products and services by the company and competitors  seasonal vaccine sales  acquisitions  dispositions or investments  changes in manufacturers pricing policies and or terms  changes in manufacturers strategy to utilize distribution  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in estimates used by management  
table of contents product supply shortages  product recalls by manufacturers  inventory valuation adjustments  changes in product mix  general competitive and economic conditions  inclement weather  changes in accounting principles  disruptions resulting from the implementation of the strategic business plan  disruptions resulting from the implementation of the enterprise resource planning systems  and changes by the government in reimbursement rates 
accordingly  management believes that period to period comparisons of the results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in certain future periods the results of operations may be below analysts and investors expectations 
this could materially and adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock 
pricing and customer credit quality pressures due to reduced spending budgets by healthcare providers may affect net sales  the collectability of accounts receivable  and earnings 
a significant portion of medical care costs in the united states of america are funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid  and corporate health insurance plans 
in recent years  government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals  physicians  and other healthcare providers have significantly impacted spending budgets in certain markets within the medical products industry 
in particular  changes in the medicare program have limited payments to providers in the long term care industry  the principal customers of the elder care business 
beginning july   medicare s prospective pay system pps was applied to the long term care industry  which limited government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
under pps  the customers of the elder care business received reimbursements that were substantially less than they received under the previous cost based reimbursement system 
as a result of reimbursement cuts and adjustments  a substantial portion of the national as well as the regional and independent nursing home facilities entered into bankruptcy 
the united states federal government recently enacted changes to pps that became effective october  the recent changes to medicare resulted in an approximate million addition to reimbursement funding for providers of elder care services that are part of the federal medicare annual budget 
in addition  the united states federal government also increased state medicaid funding by billion for providers of elder care services 
as a result of the recent medicare and medicaid changes  providers of elder care services and the elder care industry are anticipated to receive increased reimbursement from these sources 
future changes in government reimbursement rates  rules of the pps  and other regulatory changes may negatively impact the elder care business operations 
additionally  any reduction in the reimbursements available to physicians under medicare and medicaid may lead to a corresponding reduction in the spending budgets of physicians  the principal customers of the physician business 
the company s business is dependent on sophisticated data processing systems that may impair business operations if they fail to operate properly or not as anticipated 
the success of the company s business relies on the ability to obtain  process  analyze  maintain  and manage data 
in addition  data processing capabilities are continually maintained and upgraded 
the company has recently become more reliant on its information systems due to its consolidation and centralization of certain administrative functions 
management relies on this capability because rebates are received from manufacturers when certain products are sold and sophisticated systems to track  apply  and collect such rebates are used  
table of contents product cost information  net of rebates  is needed by the sales force in a timely manner to conduct business  customer orders must be received and shipped on a timely basis  billings and collections for all customers must be managed efficiently  the purchasing and distribution of over  inventory items from full service distribution centers must be managed  data and information systems must be converted after acquisitions and during operating system conversions  product reporting and tracking for vendors and vendor incentives is a requirement  sales representative compensation is based on gross margin by product and by customer  regulatory compliance on certain products requires proper tracking and reporting  and gpos and customers require sophisticated reporting 
the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if  among other things data processing capabilities are interrupted or fail for any extended length of time  data services are not kept current  the data processing system becomes unable to support expanded business  or data is lost or unable to be stored or processed 
the elder care business implementation of the jd edwards distribution module may temporarily disrupt its operations 
the elder care business currently operates the prologic enterprise resource planning system at of the distribution centers and the jde general ledger  accounts receivable  and accounts payable modules for its centralized functions 
currently  the elder care business is in the process of converting its distribution centers from prologic to the jde platform 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of the jde distribution modules at the remaining elder care business distribution centers will be successfully completed without disrupting the operations of the business 
there also can be no assurance that the implementation will be completed within the time frame projected by management 
the company s strategy for growth may not result in additional revenue or operating income and may have an adverse effect on working capital  operating cash flow  and earnings 
a key component of the company s business strategy is to increase sales to both existing and new customers  including large chains  independent operators  and provider groups 
the company intends to accomplish this by expanding its product offerings  developing innovative marketing and distribution programs  hiring additional direct sales or other personnel  increasing the national sales efforts  expanding e commerce initiatives and development  improving distribution capability and efficiency through systems development and implementation  finalizing the rationalization of the distribution network  and improving supply chain efficiency through centralization and systems implementation 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts or that these efforts will result in additional revenues or operating income 
the operating costs of the company s delivery fleet could increase due to commodity price fluctuations 
the physician and elder care businesses currently operate a delivery fleet of over vehicles 
management considers the deployment of this fleet to be one of the company s competitive advantages 
approximately of consolidated shipments are delivered via the fleet 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to pass along any unanticipated increases in fuel costs to its customers due to medicare reimbursement pressures 

table of contents the company may face competitive pricing pressures as it focuses on increasing sales to large chains and consolidating provider groups 
the company is expanding its business with large chains and consolidating provider groups  especially in the long term care market 
this may result in competitive pricing pressures due to additional negotiating leverage of large  regional and national chains  vendor agreements containing volume discounts  customer volume specifications  service specifications  negotiating favorable customer contracts  maintaining existing customer contracts  and predicting activity of competitors 
the company depends heavily on superior and unique distributorship agreements and the termination of any agreements could reduce revenues and earnings 
the company distributes over  medical products manufactured by approximately  vendors 
the company relies on these vendors to manufacture and supply these products 
during the fiscal years ended april  and march   no vendors accounted for more than of the company s consolidated inventory purchases 
the ability to maintain good relations with vendors affects the company s profitability 
currently  the company relies on vendors to provide field sales representatives technical and selling support  agreeable purchasing and delivery terms  sales performance incentives  financial support of sales and marketing programs  promotional materials  acceptable pricing and terms  and product availability 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain good relations with its vendors 
the elder care business depends on a limited number of large customers 
the elder care business depends on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of its net sales 
the elder care business has long term contracts with each of its largest customers 
the consolidation or divestiture of a large nursing home facility  whereby the elder care business were to lose a significant  large customer or portion thereof  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in prior years  the elder care business experienced failure to collect accounts receivable from some of its largest customers and an adverse change in the financial condition of its customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents acquisitions may decrease shareholders percentage ownership in the company and require the company to incur additional debt 
future acquisitions or investments may be financed by the issuance of equity securities that could be dilutive to shareholders 
additionally  the company may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets 
this additional debt and amortization expense may significantly reduce profitability and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any goodwill recorded in connection with future or existing acquisitions will require an annual impairment test which compares the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit under sfas if the company cannot integrate acquired companies within the business  profitability may be adversely affected 
although additional companies may be acquired in the future  the company may be unable to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated economic  operational  and other benefits in a timely manner 
integration of an acquired business is especially difficult when the acquired business is in a market in which the company has limited or no expertise  or has a different corporate culture 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses substantial costs and delays may be incurred  operational  technical or financial problems may be experienced  management s attention and other resources may be diverted  and relationships with key customers and employees may be damaged 
the company s indebtedness may limit the ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may limit the flexibility to react to industry or economic conditions 
the company has a revolving line of credit with maximum availability of borrowings of million 
availability of borrowings under the revolving line of credit depends upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of eligible accounts receivable  and upon satisfaction of certain requirements  eligible inventory 
any deterioration in the realizability of these assets could reduce the amount available under the revolving line of credit 
at april   the company had sufficient assets based on eligible inventories and accounts receivable to borrow up to million under the million revolving line of credit of which million was outstanding 
on march   the company sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes which mature on march  as a result  the company s total indebtedness was million as of april  the level of the company s indebtedness could limit the ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  limit the ability to make capital expenditures  limit acquisition activity  limit the company s flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions in general  and adversely affect the company s liquidity because a substantial portion of cash flow must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes 
management believes that cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings  is sufficient to meet operating expenses and service debt requirements in the future 
this belief assumes  among other things  that the business strategy will be successfully implemented and that there will be no material adverse developments in the business  liquidity  or capital requirements 
however  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness  the company will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include the following options reduce or delay acquisitions and capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure or refinance the indebtedness  and seek additional equity capital 

table of contents the company faces litigation and liability exposure for existing and potential claims 
the company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business  which are described in note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the outcomes of such proceedings or claims that are unasserted  pending  or known to be threatened could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  or results of operations 
the company must retain the services of senior management 
the company s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of senior management  particularly the president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of such individuals may adversely affect the company s business 
because of the decentralized operating infrastructure  the company is also dependent upon the operations and sales managers at each distribution center  and other key corporate officers 
the company must hire and retain qualified sales representatives to continue the sales growth 
the company s ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers is dependent upon hiring and developing new sales representatives  adding experienced sales representatives  and retaining those sales representatives 
an inability to adequately hire or retain sales representatives could limit the company s ability to expand the business and grow sales 
if a representative ceases employment  the company faces the risk of losing the representative s customers due to the relationships developed between the company s representatives and their customers 
this is particularly a risk where the representative goes to work as a representative for a competitor 
the company generally requires sales representatives to execute a noncompetition agreement as a condition of employment 
however  these agreements have not been obtained from all of these employees 
in addition  certain courts do not enforce the terms of noncompetition agreements  therefore  the company may not always be able to enforce a noncompetition agreement if an employee were to accept employment with a competitor of the company 
to mitigate this risk  the company regularly updates its noncompetition agreements in an effort to enhance the likelihood of enforcement 
the company may not be able to continue to compete successfully with other medical supply companies and direct manufacturers 
the medical supply distribution market is very competitive 
the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected if competitors lower prices of products similar to those distributed by the company  which would require the company to match the competitive pricing 
principal competitors of the company include full line and full service multimarket medical distributors and direct manufacturers  many of which have a national presence 
many of these competitors have sales representatives competing directly with the company  are substantially larger in size  have substantially greater financial resources than the company  have lower product costs  and have lower operating costs 

table of contents the company also faces significant competition from regional and local dealers and mail order firms 
several mail order competitors distribute medical supplies on a national  regional or local basis and have less operating costs including less or no sales tax charges to customers 
continued consolidation within the healthcare industry may lead to increased competition 
consolidation within the healthcare industry has resulted in increased competition by direct manufacturers  large national distributors  and drug wholesalers 
in response to competitive pressures  the company has lowered and may continue to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase its market share 
these lower selling prices have resulted  and may continue to result  in lower gross margins 
the company could face additional competition because many manufacturers are capable of directly marketing to the company s customers  many products can be readily obtained by competitors from various suppliers  competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market a product  national hospital distributors  drug wholesale distributors  and healthcare manufacturers could begin focusing their efforts more directly on the company s markets  hospitals that form alliances with long term care facilities to create integrated healthcare networks may look to hospital distributors and manufacturers to supply their long term care affiliates  and provider networks created through consolidation among physician provider groups  long term care facilities and other alternate site providers may shift purchasing decisions to people with whom the company has no selling relationship 
therefore  management cannot assure that the company will be able to maintain customer relationships in such circumstances  maintain operating margins if provider consolidations occur  and avoid increased competition and significant pricing pressure in the future 
the significant investment in inventory may be exposed to risk of product obsolescence or market valuation 
in order to provide prompt and complete service to customers  the company maintains a significant investment in inventory at the full service and strategic distribution centers 
although there are inventory control procedures and policies in place to monitor the risk of product obsolescence or declining market prices  management cannot assure that such procedures and policies will continue to be effective  the demand for certain product lines will continue  unforeseen product development or price changes will not occur  or the write off of any unsold inventory in the future will not be significant 
in addition  acquired inventory may include different product lines that are not normally distributed by the company 
these product lines may be difficult to sell and  therefore  result in a write off if such inventory is not saleable in the future 
any inventory write offs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s business  marketing activities  and pricing are subject to review by federal or state agencies 
because government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  often reimburse the cost of the company s products  the company s business  marketing activities  and pricing are subject to review by federal or state agencies  including the united states department of health and human services  the department of justice  and the food and drug administration 
although the company attempts to comply with law and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of medical products and supplies  such standards are rapidly developing and often subject to multiple interpretations 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on the company 

table of contents during fiscal year  the company acquired a company that provides billing services to the long term care industry 
as a result  the company is directly subject to medicare laws and regulations regarding billing  coding  claim submission  and coverage 
failure to comply with the regulations governing medicare reimbursement or financial reporting  or otherwise committing healthcare fraud  could subject the company to delays or loss of reimbursement  recoupment of amounts previously paid  substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in any federal health care program 
the government is actively involved in investigation of allegations of health care fraud 
in addition  the federal false claims act creates a financial incentive for private individuals  called whistleblowers  to bring suit on behalf of the government to recover funds paid pursuant to a false claim  which may include failure to comply with technical requirements for claim submission  coding  and billing 
an adverse determination regarding the company s compliance with medicare s billing  coding  claim submission  and coverage requirements  brought by either the government or a private individual  could have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the expansion of the two tiered pricing structure may place pssi at a competitive disadvantage 
the medical products industry is subject to a two tiered pricing structure 
under this structure  certain institutions  originally limited to nonprofit hospitals  can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than the company 
the two tiered pricing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power demand more favorable pricing terms 
although the company is seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers  management cannot assure that such terms will be obtained 
if such pricing structure persists  pssi may be at a competitive disadvantage 
the articles of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement  and florida law may inhibit a takeover of the company 
the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may delay  deter  or inhibit a future acquisition 
this could occur even if shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares of common stock or if a substantial number or even a majority of the company s shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with any transaction 
a staggered board of directors  the state of florida s affiliated transaction statute  or the state of florida s control share acquisition statute could delay  deter  or inhibit potential offers to acquire the company 
in addition  the rights of holders of the company s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future and that may be senior to the rights of holders of common stock 
on april   the board of directors approved a shareholder protection rights agreement that provides for one preferred stock purchase right in respect of each share of common stock 
these rights become exercisable upon a person or group of affiliated persons acquiring or more of the company s then outstanding common stock by all persons other than an existing shareholder 
this rights agreement also could discourage bids for shares of common stock at a premium and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
if pssi becomes involved in environmental claims  the company could incur substantial liabilities and costs 
the company s operations and properties are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters

the remaining proceeds were available for general corporate purposes 
the repayment of a portion of the outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit eliminated a majority of the company s floating rate debt and replaced it with long term debt with interest at a fixed rate

changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts  commercial paper  and government securities 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of short term investments
