item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that the company s preparation of this annual report on form k requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of its software products  professional consulting  and support and maintenance services 
license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the 
table of contents product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
from time to time the company will enter into extended payment programs with creditworthy customers 
revenue related to extended payment programs is recognized when payment becomes due to the company 
in making its decision to recognize revenue the company must make a determination of the credit worthiness of its customer 
this determination involves management judgment and while management believes that it can make reliable judgments  there is no guarantee that the revenue recognized will be collected 
the credit worthiness of customers is further analyzed in connection with the company s accounts receivable 
the company recognizes revenue under multiple element arrangements using the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
the company has established sufficient vsoe for the value of its consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with consulting  training or other services 
the company s products and the industries in which they compete are not static and the determination of vsoe involves judgment 
management believes that it will continue to be able to use the residual method for recognizing license revenue under multiple element arrangements 
if the company was unable to continue to use the residual method  it could affect the timing of revenue recognition and thus the trends that the company is currently experiencing 
professional services include custom design and development and training 
the company recognizes professional services revenue under software development contracts as services are provided for per diem contracts or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term fixed price contracts 
provisions for any estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses become probable 
the company had no long term contracts in progress as of december  revenue from end user product sales is recognized upon delivery of the software  net of estimated returns and allowances  if collection is probable 
the company estimates returns and allowances based on historical rates and as of december  does not have a reserve as returns and allowances have been negligible 
if and when a reserve is necessary the company would reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of return 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
the company generally warrants that its products will function substantially in accordance with documentation provided to customers for approximately days following initial delivery 
as of december   the company had not incurred any expense related to warranty claims 
the company estimates reserves based on historical rates and accordingly has not recorded a warranty reserve 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
please refer to note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on its revenue recognition policies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tested recorded goodwill attributable to each reporting unit for impairment 
management conducted impairment testing as of december  and determined that the fair value of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values for those units 
though none of the unamortized goodwill was impaired  there can be no assurance that when a future review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
sfas no 
required certain disclosures upon adoption that the company has included in note j in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 

table of contents accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the company s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has experienced in the past 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
the company has fully reserved against its tax asset 
the valuation allowance is due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the determination of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates  which the company cannot guarantee will prove to be accurate

investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
actual performance and results of operations may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements due to certain risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  market acceptance of the company s products  competition and the timely introduction of new products 
additional information concerning certain risks and uncertainties that would cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements is contained in the company s prior filings with the securities and exchange commission  including those risks and uncertainties discussed in the company s final prospectus  dated october   included as part of the company s registration statement on form s  in the section entitled risk factors 
the forward looking statements contained herein represent the company s judgment as of the date of this report  and the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such statements 
management undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document 
the company is subject to risks common to technology based companies  including dependence on key personnel  rapid technological change  competition from alternative product offerings and larger companies  and challenges to the development and marketing of commercial products and services 
we believe that our future results of operations could be affected by various factors  including the following delays in the development or shipment of our new products or new versions of our existing products  the introduction of competitive products by others  general worldwide economic conditions  inability to attract and retain key personnel  intellectual property disputes  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  changes in accounting rules  and unanticipated changes in tax rates and regulations 
the computer software market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and adoption of new industry standards 
as the markets in which the company s products are sold continue to develop and as the company enters new markets  the company expects to continue to face substantial competition from other software developers and anticipates that additional competitors will enter those markets 
many of the company s competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards or changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company 
many of these competitors currently market  or can potentially market  their products directly to the ultimate consumers of such products as part of a broader product offering 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against these entities 
to compete successfully  the company must continue to invest in research and product development and must devote substantial resources to its marketing and sales functions 
there can be no assurance that the company 
table of contents will have the necessary capital resources to fund such investment 
also  if we are unable to consistently introduce new products  services  and enhancements  our revenue and operating results are likely to decrease 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond to new technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products  when first released by the company  may contain undetected errors that  despite quality control measures employed by the company  are discovered only after a product has been integrated into the oem and isv product and used by customers 
such errors may cause delays in product acceptance and may require design modifications which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business may also be affected by general worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate 
adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in and beyond  resulting in reduced demand for some of our products  increased pressure on the prices for our products and services  and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
for example  revenue from our type segment s font and font technology product lines decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the continuing weakness in the economy and aggressive competition among printer manufacturers is contributing to lower average selling prices of printers  which may result in attempts to reduce our royalty arrangements or may cause our printer customers to pursue alternative technologies 
to address this issue  we are pursuing a number of strategies to generate revenue growth  including identifying new markets for our products  developing new applications for our technologies  allocating research and development funding to products with high revenue potential  and strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets 
our investments in our pageflex and thunderhawk technologies reflect our commitment to these strategies 
due to limited resources  we may not be able to continue to successfully implement these strategies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of the company s revenues for the year ended december  this revenue does not include revenue derived from products sold into the international market by the company s domestic oem and isv customers or foreign purchases downloaded from the company s myfonts 
com and bitstream 
com web sites 
the company expects that its international business will continue to account for a significant portion of its future revenues 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive and therefore less competitive in foreign markets 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future revenues and the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s european business is significant and has historically been negatively affected during the three months ended september th due to the summer closing or slowdown of several european customers 
these seasonal factors have affected  and may continue to affect  the company s quarterly results of operations 
the company s performance depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its senior management and key technical employees 
the company s future results will depend upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the software industry is intense 
we rely on competitive compensation packages to recruit and retain highly skilled employees in a competitive environment  but we do not enter into employment agreements with our personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to sustain its business 
failure to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods of protection 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be adequate or that the company s competitors 
table of contents will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer portions of the company s products or otherwise obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of unauthorized use of the company s technologies and products more likely 
we also rely on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been  are currently and may in the future be subject to claims  negotiations or complex  protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  including rights derived from third party licensors 
intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes 
adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from making  using  selling  distributing  or marketing our products and services in the united states or abroad  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
additionally  although we actively pursue software pirates as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we do lose revenue due to illegal use of our software 
if piracy activities increase  it may further harm our business 
the company has previously experienced quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results as a result of a number of factors including the timing of new product introductions  announcements of new products by the company  its competitors or its customers  slower than anticipated growth rates of emerging markets  slower adoption of new products and technologies into which the company s products are incorporated  delays in customer purchases in anticipation of industry developments  and gross margin fluctuations relating to variations in product mix 
furthermore  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in nature and the company may not be able to reduce spending in response to shortfalls or delays in sales 
such shortfalls or delays may result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
moreover  the company does not operate with a significant backlog and often tends to realize a disproportionate share of its revenues in the last few weeks of a fiscal quarter  thereby impairing the company s ability to accurately forecast quarter to quarter sales results 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in one or more future fiscal quarters the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s class a common stock which could have a negative effect on the company s ability to obtain additional funding  if necessary  on terms favorable to the company 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec the public company accounting oversight board the pcaob and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these principles and policies could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
for example  a proposed change to the method for accounting for stock options  if adopted  could result in the company recognizing additional expense upon the grant of such options  which  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
additionally  to avoid the additional expense resulting from having to expense option grants  the company may refrain from granting additional options  which may make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain 
table of contents skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
changes to these rules may have a significant adverse effect on future financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
unanticipated changes in tax rates could adversely affect our future results of operations 
increases in tax rates or changes in how taxes are assessed could increase the company s tax liabilities  which would negatively effect the company s business and financial results
