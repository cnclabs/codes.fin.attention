a variety of business development and marketing channels are used to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars and industry specific articles 
new engagements are sought and won by the company s senior and mid level consultants 
future performance will continue to depend on the consultants ability to win new engagements 
a significant portion of new business arises from prior client engagements 
in addition  the company seeks to leverage the client relationships in one business segment to cross sell existing services provided by the other segment 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary activities 
in addition  on site presence affords the company s consultants the opportunity to become aware of  and to help define  additional project opportunities as they are identified 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees for professional services 
over the last three years  a substantial majority of the company s revenues has been generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
from time to time  the company earns incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billing  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause variations in quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same

many of the company s engagements involve working in conjunction with the legal counsel of our clients 
human capital as of december   the company had  employees  including consultants 
revenues are primarily generated from services performed by the company s consultants  therefore  success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced professionals at all levels

in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  the company has acquired and seeks to acquire consulting businesses to both add highly skilled professionals and expand the services offered by the company 
some of the acquired businesses were direct competitors to the company  while others had been retained as independent contractors to supplement certain engagements 
the company believes that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and consulting capabilities strengthens its platform  market share and overall operating results 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  the company s policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that 
table of contents extend months beyond the employees termination date

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the mspp the company continually monitors and adjusts  if needed  the consultants total compensation  which includes salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  and other cash and equity incentives from certain company programs  to ensure both that the consultants compensation is competitive within the industry and that the company has the opportunity to achieve target profitability levels 
material changes to the company s compensation structure are done with the requisite approval from the compensation committee of the company s board of directors 
the company s bill rates to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and levels of the consulting staff 
the company monitors and adjusts those bill rates according to the supply and demand of the then current market conditions within the various industry segments served by the company 
in addition  the company recently changed its formal compensation program to require certain senior consulting leaders to receive payment of a portion of incentive compensation in restricted stock instead of cash 
competition the market for consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the national accounting firms  and other local  regional  national and international firms 
many of these companies are global in scope and have greater personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that its independence  experience  reputation  industry focus and broad range of professional services will enable it to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace 
d other matters concentration of revenues there were no clients that accounted for more than percent of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  one client from the energy consulting segment accounted for more than percent of the company s total revenues for the years ended december  and revenues earned from the company s top clients amounted to percent  percent and percent of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively

business risks in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
such factors could have a significant impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company relies heavily on its consulting staff and management team 
the company s inability to retain highly skilled professionals  coupled with departures of a significant number of senior employees  could have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents the company s common stock price may fall and any investment in the company may be materially affected 
any long term decline in the common stock would impair the company s ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
the company uses equity based compensation as a portion of senior and mid level consultants overall compensation packages 
equity based compensation is used to help align the interests of its employees and stockholders  but complete alignment is difficult to achieve 
compensation and retention related issues represent a continuing challenge for the company 
specialized systems and processes have been developed by the company and provide a competitive advantage in servicing current clients and obtaining new clients 
this intellectual capital is the property of the company and the unauthorized use could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business 
additionally  many of our service offerings rely on technology that is subject to rapid change 
the company s intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
a new governmental regulation could allow a competitor a significant advantage before the company is able to adapt to new updated service demands 
the company must manage growth from both organically expanding services and the acquisition of complementary consulting firms 
this growth and integration of acquisitions may cause strain on our management team and our systems 
the strain on management from rapid growth or unsuccessful integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on the future profitability of the company 
the company s return of capital may not materialize on certain business acquisitions 
the company also may pay a substantial premium on certain business acquisitions to remain competitive 
the financing of these acquisitions through cash  borrowings  or common stock could impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
the company s engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to its office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
the company s inability to continually replace a significant portion of current engagements with new engagements would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its current and future commitments 
the company maintains a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements from normal operations 
this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  a minimum level of earnings 
poor performance of the company could cause the company to be in default of these existing covenants 
additionally  the company cannot be certain that it will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to execute future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectability would likely be required 
the professional reputation of the company and its consultants is critical to the company s ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the risk of professional liability 
the company s consultants engage in complex analyses in which the exercise of professional judgment is critical 
if services are not performed to the client s satisfaction  a client may threaten or bring a lawsuit against the company  claiming the company performed negligently or breached its obligation to the client 
in certain cases  there is potential that persons other than clients may bring claims against the company 
a claim against the company could exceed the limits of the company s insurance coverage and could damage the company s reputation 

table of contents legislative changes affecting our clients  our competitors  or our staff could have an impact on business 
an example of this is the sarbanes oxley act of  which limits the services that public accounting firms are permitted to provide to their audit clients 
the company is not a public accounting firm and therefore is not subject to such restrictions 
changes to the sarbanes oxley act or rules promulgated thereunder  as well as other legislation could have an impact on the company s business 
international operations the company has an international presence with offices in the united kingdom  mexico and canada
