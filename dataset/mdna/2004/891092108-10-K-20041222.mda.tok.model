overview the toro company is in the business of designing  manufacturing  and marketing professional turf maintenance equipment and services  turf and agricultural irrigation systems  landscaping equipment  and residential yard products worldwide 
our products are sold through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  mass retailers  and over the internet  mainly through internet retailers 
our businesses are organized into three segments professional  residential  and distribution 
a fourth segment called other consists of corporate and financing activities 
our emphasis is to provide well built  dependable  and innovative products supported by an extensive service network 
a significant portion of our revenues has historically been attributable to new and enhanced products 
financial overview fiscal was another record setting year with double digit sales and earnings growth 
our net earnings rose percent compared to fiscal on net sales growth of percent 
in addition  our after tax return on net sales rose to percent from percent for fiscal sales of most of our product lines were up mainly as a result of successful new products introduced within the past two years  favorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar  and overall improving economic conditions that have resulted in strong retail demand in most of our businesses 
the following table sets forth for the fiscal years indicated net sales by segment and the related percent change from the prior fiscal year 
dollars in thousands vs 
fiscal years ended october change professional residential distribution other total net sales our financial condition remains strong with lower average debt levels due to lower average inventory levels and higher earnings compared to the prior fiscal year  offset by only a modest increase in average receivables 
this has allowed us to reinvest in product development  brand building  and new technologies 
we also increased our emphasis on repurchasing shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of million to utilize excess cash and reduce our shares 
table of contents outstanding that also resulted in a benefit of approximately per diluted share in fiscal compared to fiscal overall  fiscal was a strong year and we believe we are in a position for yet another good year in fiscal key drivers for our growth in fiscal will be the continued success of our product innovation  focusing on markets that are underserved by our brands  developing integrated services with our product offering  and adapting to an ever changing competitive marketplace by becoming a solutions provider  while keeping a cautionary eye on the world economies  weather  field inventory levels  commodity prices  and other factors identified under the caption forward looking statements in item of this annual report on form k  which could cause our actual results to differ from our outlook 
initiative accelerating our future fiscal marked the beginning of our next generation initiative called teamwork to the top 
the goals of this initiative are to achieve a consistent after tax return on sales of percent or more and grow revenues at an average annual rate of percent or more over the three year period ending october  the following are the focus areas of this initiative 
lean no waste 
the mindset of driving change and process improvement developed with our prior by five initiative during fiscal years through has continued with this new initiative that is linked to applying lean methods in our manufacturing plants and offices 
throughout the organization  we are rethinking our business and manufacturing processes to improve our efficiency and responsiveness 
employees are engaged in cross functional teams to take a fresh look at their jobs and processes to eliminate waste and unnecessary steps that do not add value while delivering measurable gains in productivity  throughput  and quality 
investing in growth 
at the same time  we recognize the need to drive stronger revenue growth through accelerated investments in innovative products and services  product branding  new technologies  and expansion in current and new markets 
we are redirecting a portion of our lean no waste savings to finding new and better solutions that address customer problems to create market differentiation  generate higher margins  and build strong and unique brands 
as sales increase  we will continue to reinvest in research and development to sustain our legacy of market leadership 
strengthening culture 
we are taking steps to continue to strengthen our long standing cultural values that are designed to maximize our organizational effectiveness and creativity  with particular emphasis on teamwork and partnership  communication  job requirements  and customer responsiveness 
we recognize that the collective contributions  energy  and commitment of our employees are the key factors in our success 
therefore  we will continue to invest in education  surveys  focus groups  and other methods to ensure all employees are engaged in a mindset of continuous improvement that will deliver sustainable results 
leadership transition on october   the board of directors appointed michael j 
hoffman to the position of president and chief operating officer 
this appointment is the latest step in a comprehensive succession plan that the board of directors adopted a number of years ago 
the plan is designed to culminate in the election of a new chief executive officer no later than october   at which time kendrick b 
melrose will step down from his current role as chief executive officer to become executive chairman of the board of directors 
significant transactions and financial trends throughout these financial sections  you will read about significant transactions or events that materially contribute to or reduce our earnings and materially affect financial trends 
during fiscal  we experienced rising costs for steel and other commodity prices that reduced our gross margins and net earnings 
this trend is expected to continue into fiscal as increased worldwide demand and other factors are driving higher prices for steel and other commodities 
to partially offset the higher commodity costs we are experiencing  we have introduced moderate price increases on certain product lines for fiscal we also plan to generate cost savings through ongoing cost reduction efforts as we continue to implement lean methods and processes in our plants 
significant transactions that affected our prior fiscal years operating results included an impairment charge recorded in fiscal for automation equipment that no longer is used  a gain resulting from a legal settlement in fiscal  restructuring and other income expense in fiscal and to a lesser extent in fiscal and fiscal  the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of adopting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in fiscal  a goodwill amortization change effective the beginning of fiscal  and a one time federal tax refund in fiscal these significant transactions result from unique facts and circumstances that likely will not recur with similar materiality or impact on our continuing operations 
while these items are important in understanding and evaluating our financial results and trends  other transactions or events such as those discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis may also have a material impact on financial trends 
a complete understanding of these transactions is necessary in order to estimate the likelihood that financial trends will continue 

table of contents results of operations fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
fiscal net earnings per diluted share were  an increase of percent over per diluted share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings increase were higher sales volumes and improved leveraging of selling  general  and administrative expense 
however  the growth in fiscal net earnings relative to fiscal was somewhat tempered by a decline in other income compared to fiscal fiscal net earnings were million or per diluted share  a significant improvement from fiscal net earnings of million or per diluted share 
results for fiscal included the following three significant items a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that reduced net earnings by million for the goodwill write off related to the adoption of sfas no 
 restructuring and other expense of million million net of tax  and a tax refund that reduced tax expense by million 
other factors contributing to the net earnings increase included higher sales  an increase in gross margin resulting from profit improvement initiatives  and lower interest expense 
this was somewhat offset by higher selling  general  and administrative expense 
the following table summarizes the results of operations as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal years ended october net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense restructuring and other expense interest expense other income  net provision for income taxes earnings before accounting change as we enter fiscal  we anticipate another strong year of growth due to the introduction of new products and anticipated improving economic conditions 
sales are expected to grow at an annual rate of to percent in fiscal and diluted net earnings per share are expected to grow at an annual rate of to percent over fiscal  which includes the impact of adopting sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  discussed later in the section entitled new accounting pronouncements to be adopted 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
sales growth was primarily driven by market acceptance of new products introduced within the past two years across many product lines 
continued increase in demand for landscape contractor equipment as a result of continued market growth and acceptance of new products 
favorable currency rates that contributed approximately percent of the sales growth for fiscal international sales grew percent driven primarily by a weaker us dollar and new product introductions 
disregarding currency effects  international sales were up percent for fiscal higher distribution segment sales as a result of strong demand and improving economic conditions 
somewhat offsetting the factors contributing to our sales growth was a decline in domestic irrigation product sales  mainly domestic residential commercial irrigation products 
looking ahead  we expect sales to grow at an annual rate of to percent in fiscal compared to the sales reported in fiscal  driven primarily by the introduction of new products  expected continuing favorable economic conditions  and strategic marketing activities directed at underserved markets  such as revitalizing the lawn boy brand with new products and accelerating the growth rate in international markets 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly by percentage point from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this improvement was mainly the result of the following factors cost reduction efforts  including ongoing benefits from past and continuing profit improvement initiatives  as well as moving production to facilities with lower operating costs 
lower manufacturing costs from increased plant utilization as a result of reduced excess manufacturing capacity  mainly related to increased demand for our products 
higher international gross margins as a result of the weaker us dollar 
fiscal gross margins were negatively impacted by an impairment charge for automation equipment that was no longer used and subsequently disposed 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors were rising steel and other commodity prices 
increased outbound freight costs due to higher fuel costs and increased demand for transportation 
looking ahead  gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to remain the same in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate benefits from ongoing past and continuing profit improvement initiatives driven by our emphasis on lean manufacturing as well as moderate price increases will be offset by anticipated higher commodity prices 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expense increased percent from fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was due primarily 
table of contents to leveraging fixed sg a costs over higher sales volumes as well as the following other factors a decline in bad debt expense due mainly to a recovery of a previously written off note receivable 
costs for distributor changes in fiscal that did not occur in fiscal reduced warranty expense due mainly to lower claims experience on certain product lines 
lower warehousing expenses due to consolidation and the reduction of the number of warehousing facilities utilized 
somewhat offsetting those decreases were increased investments in engineering  marketing  and information systems as part of our initiative 
higher incentive compensation costs due to the significant improvement in our financial performance  on which incentive compensation is based 
in addition  the increase in toro s stock price during fiscal also contributed to higher compensation expense for our performance share plan 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
looking ahead  sg a expense is expected to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal as we continue to accelerate our investments in engineering and brand marketing as part of our initiative 
however  we expect to continue to leverage sg a costs over higher sales volumes in fiscal restructuring and other income expense 
restructuring and other income for fiscal was million compared to restructuring and other expense of million in fiscal during fiscal  we announced plans to close our two cycle engine manufacturing facility located in oxford  mississippi that resulted in a pre tax restructuring and other expense charge of million 
see item  environmental matters and other governmental regulation section for additional information 
on april   we ceased operations at that facility 
during fiscal  we realized a net benefit of million mainly as a result of selling assets that were previously identified for disposal in connection with the closure of this facility 
we also realized a net benefit of million due to the reversal of an impairment write down for the madera  california facility in anticipation of the sale of that facility  which was sold during the first quarter of fiscal for a gain 
looking ahead  we expect to incur additional  but immaterial ongoing restructuring and other expenses until our oxford  mississippi facility is sold 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal declined percent compared to fiscal due primarily to lower average debt levels as we continued to use earnings to finance operating activities and pay down debt 
looking ahead  interest expense is expected to increase as a result of higher interest rates 
we also anticipate average debt levels to increase due to the use of our excess cash for significant purchases of our common stock during fiscal and anticipated purchases of our common stock in fiscal other income  net 
other income  net consists mainly of interest income  financing income  royalty income  litigation settlements and recovery  currency exchange rate gains and losses  and equity losses from investments 
other income  net for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was due mainly to the following factors litigation expense incurred in fiscal however  during fiscal  we received proceeds from a legal settlement and insurance recoveries 
equity losses incurred from an investment and a loss recognized for the sale of a business in fiscal those negative factors were somewhat offset by higher interest income and finance charge revenue 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the increase was due mainly to an increase in tax reserves for certain state and international issues  partially offset by a reduction in the tax on international operations 
looking ahead  the tax rate for fiscal is expected to slightly increase 
legislation has been enacted to repeal certain foreign export tax incentives that we have qualified for in the past fiscal year 
this legislation also includes provisions that allows for a deduction from qualified production activities 
while the implication of these provisions varies based on the transition rules and the longer term mix of income  we expect the provisions  after fully phased in  to have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
sales growth was primarily driven by market acceptance of new product introductions across many product lines 
favorable currency rates that contributed approximately percent of the sales growth for fiscal international sales grew percent driven primarily by a weaker us dollar  making our products less expensive in foreign currencies 
disregarding currency effects  international sales were up percent for fiscal principally due to new product introductions 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this increase was mainly the result of cost reduction efforts that included reducing raw material costs and moving production to facilities with lower operating costs 

table of contents lower manufacturing costs from increased plant utilization due to reduced excess manufacturing capacity  mainly related to the closure of three facilities and increased demand for our products 
a reduction of the gross profit elimination percentage due to a change in estimate applied to the ending toro inventory value at our company owned distributors 
higher international gross margins as a result of the weaker us dollar 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors were higher inbound freight costs as we moved some of our production to juarez  mexico 
an impairment charge for automation equipment no longer used and subsequently disposed 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expense increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal these increases were due primarily to the following factors higher administrative expenses  mainly from increased investments in information systems and distributor changes 
increased marketing expense tied to higher sales 
higher incentive compensation costs due to successful achievement of financial goals  on which incentive compensation is based 
higher warranty expense due to higher sales volumes and changes in estimates 
restructuring and other expense 
restructuring and other expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we announced plans to close our two cycle engine manufacturing facility located in oxford  mississippi that resulted in a pre tax restructuring and other expense charge of million 
we also recorded a benefit of million for the reversal of the remaining accrual for closing a facility in australia  which was sold during fiscal during fiscal  we announced the closing of three manufacturing facilities 
these actions were part of our long term strategy to reduce production costs and improve long term competitiveness 
closing these facilities resulted in a pre tax restructuring and other expense charge of million in fiscal we also incurred a million charge for asset impairment related to the write off of patents and non compete agreements in the agricultural irrigation business 
based on our evaluation of the recoverability of some acquired intangible assets  we determined that the acquired patents and non compete agreements in the agricultural irrigation business had no future value due to changes in this business 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal declined percent compared to fiscal due primarily to lower average debt levels as we continued to use earnings to pay down debt 
other income  net 
other income  net for fiscal increased million or percent compared to fiscal this increase was due mainly to proceeds from a legal settlement and insurance recoveries 
these positive factors were somewhat offset by higher levels of currency exchange rate losses  lower levels of finance charge revenue  and reduced royalty income 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal  before a one time federal tax refund of million in fiscal including the one time federal tax refund  the effective tax rate was percent for fiscal the decrease was due mainly to additional federal tax credits received in fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we performed an evaluation of goodwill as of november  the results of this evaluation indicated that goodwill related to the agricultural irrigation reporting unit was impaired 
we therefore recognized a million non cash charge  net of income tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal performance by business segment as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
a fourth reportable segment called other consists of corporate and financing functions 
operating earnings loss for each of our three business segments is defined as earnings loss from operations plus other income  net 
operating losses for our fourth other segment consists of corporate activities  including corporate financing activities  other income  net  and interest expense 
the following information provides perspective on our business segments sales and operating results 
professional professional segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal   and the following table shows the professional segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
table of contents net sales 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal as a result of the following factors worldwide shipments of most product lines were up driven primarily by our success of introducing new products within the past two years 
continued increase in demand for landscape contractor equipment as a result of the growing market and our customers acceptance of new products 
international sales were up significantly due to strong demand and the successful introduction of new products as well as a weaker us dollar 
overall improving economic conditions have resulted in strong retail demand in most of our businesses 
somewhat offsetting those increases were lower domestic residential commercial irrigation product shipments as our customers reduced orders to lower their field inventory levels  and unfavorable weather conditions in key markets 
field inventory levels for most professional segment equipment product lines were higher as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal as a result of lower than anticipated retail demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to unusually strong retail demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  strong orders from our customers also contributed to the increase in field inventory levels due to anticipated strong retail demand in fiscal as a result of our new innovative products and expectations that economic conditions will continue to improve 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal worldwide shipments of most product lines increased due to the successful introduction of new products as well as lower field inventory levels and a stronger order position entering fiscal as compared to those entering fiscal in addition  favorable currency exchange rates contributed to sales growth 
looking ahead  sales for the professional segment are expected to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal because we expect new products to be well received and anticipate economic conditions to continue to improve 
in addition  we introduced price increases for some products that should also contribute to sales growth in fiscal operating earnings 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased to percent compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted professional segment operating earnings lower sg a expense as a percentage of net sales contributed to the operating earnings improvement as we leveraged the fixed portion of sg a costs over higher sales volumes and reduced warranty expense 
gross margin rose slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the same reasons discussed previously in the gross profit section 
somewhat offsetting the operating earnings improvement was lower other income in fiscal as we received a gain from a legal settlement in fiscal operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal however  fiscal operating earnings were reduced by pre tax restructuring and other expense of million 
the operating profit improvement was due mainly to higher gross margins as a result of benefits from our by five initiatives and slightly lower sg a expense as a percentage of net sales due to leveraging the fixed portion of sg a costs over higher sales volumes 
in addition  proceeds from a legal settlement contributed to the profit improvement 
somewhat offsetting the increase in operating earnings was an impairment charge for automation equipment discussed previously 
looking ahead  professional segment earnings are anticipated to improve in fiscal compared to fiscal due to expected sales growth  slight improvement in gross margins  and leveraging of sg a costs 
residential residential segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal   and the following table shows the residential segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal as a result of the following factors snow thrower sales were up due to customer acceptance of new products and strong demand as a result of heavy snowfalls in key markets during the winter season that depleted field inventory levels 
strong shipments of walk power mowers driven by the introduction of new models as well as strong retail demand 
home solutions product shipments increased as a result of additional shelf placement and new product introductions 
riding product sales were slightly higher due to initial stocking shipments of new products sold under a private label 
however  other riding product sales declined due to continued strong competition 

table of contents international sales benefited from a weaker us dollar as well as strong sales of pope products in australia and increased sales of snow throwers  home solutions  and walk power mower products 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal riding product shipments increased due to initial stocking orders and positive customer acceptance for the new line of timecutter z mowers 
however  other riding product lines were down due to strong competition and a shift of sales to the new timecutter riding mowers 
toro walk power mowers were also up due to successful promotional programs and strong retail demand 
snow thrower product sales also increased due mainly to initial stocking orders for our new two stage snow thrower products 
somewhat offsetting this increase was lower electric trimmer and blower shipments due to lost shelf space at a home center customer and poor weather conditions 
looking ahead  residential segment sales are expected to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal led by new product introductions and additional shelf space at a key retailer for some new products 
operating earnings 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins slightly increased to percent compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted residential segment operating earnings lower sg a expense as a percentage of net sales contributed to the operating earnings improvement as we leveraged the fixed portion of sg a costs over higher sales volumes 
somewhat offsetting the operating earnings improvement was lower gross margin as a result of rising steel and other commodity costs and increased freight expense 
in addition  fiscal operating earnings were negatively affected by a restructuring and other expense charge of million mainly related to the closure of our two cycle engine manufacturing facility 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins increased slightly to percent compared to percent in fiscal mainly as a result of higher gross margins 
in addition  fiscal operating earnings were negatively affected by the restructuring and other expense charge of million discussed previously 
looking ahead  residential segment earnings are expected to slightly increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to anticipated higher sales volumes and leveraging sg a costs 
distribution the following table shows the distribution segment net sales and operating earnings loss 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales operating earnings loss net sales 
net sales for the distribution segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal the sales increase was due primarily to strong demand for commercial equipment and irrigation products as a result of improving economic conditions  higher sales of snow thrower products  and the addition of sales from a southeastern based distributorship acquired during fiscal factoring out sales from the acquired distributorship and a distribution company sold effective december   sales increased percent compared to fiscal net sales for the distribution segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal the sales decline was primarily the result of selling one of the previously owned distributorships effective december   somewhat offset by the addition of sales from a southeastern based us distributor acquired during fiscal factoring out sales from the sold distributorship and the acquired distributorship  net sales for the distribution segment were down by percent due mainly to lower snow thrower product sales in the midwestern region as well as a decline in irrigation product sales 
looking ahead  we expect distribution segment sales in fiscal to decrease as a result of the divestiture of our southeastern based distributorship during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the divestiture of our southwestern based distributorship during the first quarter of fiscal therefore  fiscal will only include results from two company owned distributors compared to four during fiscal operating earnings losses 
operating earnings for the distribution segment in fiscal were million compared to operating losses of million in fiscal this favorable change in operating earnings was due mainly to higher sales volumes and operating improvements at the company owned distributorships 
operating losses for the distribution segment in fiscal were million compared to operating earnings of million in fiscal  an unfavorable change of million 
this unfavorable change in operating earnings was due mainly to the divestiture of a previously owned distributorship 
looking ahead  we expect fiscal operating earnings for this segment to be higher than in fiscal as a result of the divestiture in the fourth quarter of fiscal of our unprofitable southeastern based distributorship 

table of contents other net sales 
net sales for the other segment include the elimination of sales from the professional and residential segments to the distribution segment 
professional and residential segment shipments to the company owned distributorships are eliminated in the other segment because consolidated results reflect those sales in the distribution segment after products are sold by the company owned distributorships 
in addition  elimination of the professional and residential segments floor plan interest costs from toro credit company are also included in this segment 
the other segment net sales elimination in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal this increase was driven by higher shipments to the distribution companies as a result of strong retail demand 
the other segment net sales elimination in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal this decline was due to lower shipments to the distribution companies mainly as a result of the divestiture of a distributorship during the first quarter of fiscal this was somewhat offset by the acquisition of a distributorship during the second half of fiscal operating loss 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal was up percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was due mainly to higher incentive compensation costs  increased spending for information systems  higher litigation costs  and the fact that fiscal was favorably impacted by a reduction of the gross profit elimination percentage due to a change in estimate applied to the ending toro inventory at our company owned distributors 
those increases were somewhat offset by lower bad debt expense and costs for distributor changes in fiscal that did not occur in fiscal operating loss for the other segment in fiscal was up percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was due to higher incentive compensation expenses  rising insurance costs  and increased investments in information systems and distributor changes 
somewhat offsetting the operating loss increase was lower interest expense  higher litigation recovery  and a reduction of the gross profit elimination percentage due to a change in estimate applied to the ending toro inventory value at our company owned distributors 
financial condition working capital our financial condition remains strong with continued emphasis on improving asset management 
our average working capital for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
this increase was due mainly to lower average short term debt and higher average cash and cash equivalents  somewhat offset by higher average accrued liabilities in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of increased average incentive and sales based marketing accruals 
the following table highlights several key measures of our working capital performance 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october average cash and cash equivalents average short term debt average inventories  net average receivables  net average days outstanding for receivables inventory turnover x x average short term debt decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because we used cash generated from earnings to pay down debt  which also resulted in higher average cash and cash equivalents in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in average receivables  net was due primarily to higher sales volumes and higher foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the weaker us dollar 
average days outstanding for receivables improved to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal due primarily to a higher proportion of sales that have shorter payment terms  strong retail demand  and million of account receivable balances refinanced to long term loans for a distributor 
average net inventories decreased percent and average inventory turnover improved in fiscal compared to fiscal this favorable change was driven by higher than anticipated sales volumes and efforts to improve inventory turnover 
we expect that average receivables and inventory levels in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal due to higher planned sales volumes 
we anticipate both average days outstanding for receivables and average inventory turnover to slightly improve in fiscal compared to fiscal as we continue efforts to improve asset utilization 
capital expenditures and other long term assets net property  plant  and equipment increased by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal however  capital expenditures were percent lower in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline was due primarily to production equipment and tooling expenditures in fiscal for new products we introduced within the past two years 
capital expenditures for fiscal are planned to be approximately to million higher than fiscal as we continue to invest in information service technology  manufacturing equipment  and tooling for new products 
long term assets as of october  were million compared to million as of october   an increase of percent 
this increase was due to an increase of net property  plant  and equipment and long term loans refinanced from account receivable balances discussed previously 

table of contents capital structure the following table details our total capitalization components and key ratios 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october short term debt long term debt  including current portion stockholders equity debt to capitalization ratio total debt to capitalization ratio was slightly worse in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to a decrease in stockholders equity as a result of significantly higher amounts of shares of our common stock we repurchased in fiscal compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of raw materials used in production  replacement parts inventory  capital expenditures  expansion and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as for financing receivables from customers 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our fixed rate long term debt  bank credit lines  and cash on hand  will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements 
we believe that the combination of funds available through existing or anticipated financing arrangements  coupled with forecasted cash flows  will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayments  dividend payments  and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
in fiscal  our board of directors approved an increase in our first quarter of fiscal dividend  payable on january   from our historical rate of 
per share to 
per share 
cash flow cash flows provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities during the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table 
cash provided by used in dollars in millions fiscal years ended october operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net cash flows used provided cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end cash flows provided by operating activities 
our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased significantly by percent from fiscal this improvement was due primarily to higher earnings  a lower increase in accounts receivable  and higher accrued liabilities  mainly incentive and marketing accruals 
in addition  an increase of tax benefits related to stock option transactions also contributed to the improvement of cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flows used in investing activities 
capital expenditures continue to be a primary use of capital resources 
cash used in investing activities decreased by percent due mainly to a lower level of purchases of property  plant  and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal  as discussed previously 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was significantly higher by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this was primarily driven by increased funds used to purchase our common stock for million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal refer to section share repurchase plan below for additional details 
credit lines and other capital resources our business is seasonal  with accounts receivable balances historically increasing between january and april as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers  and decreasing between may and december when payments are received 
the seasonality of production and shipments causes working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year 
our peak borrowing usually occurs between february and may 
seasonal cash requirements are financed from operations and with short and medium term financing arrangements  including a million unsecured senior five year revolving credit facility  which expires in september we also have a million secured credit line backed by a multi year credit agreement  expiring in july  which is renewable annually 
interest expense on these credit lines is determined based on a libor or commercial paper rate plus a basis point spread defined in the credit agreements 
in addition  our non us operations and a domestic subsidiary also maintain unsecured short term lines of credit of approximately million 
these facilities bear interest at various rates depending on the rates in their respective countries of operation 
we also have a letter of credit subfacility as part of our credit agreements 
average short term debt was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
this decline was primarily attributable to our use of cash generated from earnings to pay down debt and finance operating activities 
as of october   we had million of unutilized availability under our credit agreements 
significant financial covenants in our credit agreements are interest coverage and debt to capitalization ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our credit agreements as of october   and expect to be in compliance with all 
table of contents covenants in fiscal our credit agreements require compliance with all of the covenants defined in the agreements 
if we were out of compliance with any debt covenant required by our credit agreements  the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver from the banks 
in addition  our long term public notes and debentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our medium term debt under our credit agreements 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade  the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt on the credit agreements would increase  but the credit commitments could not be cancelled by the banks based only on a ratings downgrade 
our debt rating for long term unsecured senior  non credit enhanced debt has been unchanged for the past fiscal year by standard and poor s ratings group at bbb and by moody s investors service at baa share repurchase plan during fiscal  we increased our emphasis on repurchasing shares of our common stock as a means of utilizing excess cash and reducing our shares outstanding 
in addition  our repurchase programs provide shares for use in connection with our equity compensation 
in order to accomplish this  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock during fiscal as follows in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock in open market or private transactions 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares  bringing the total number of shares that can be repurchased in open market transactions  tender offers  private purchases or other transactions to  in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of our common stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated purchases 
all of the above repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates but may be terminated by our board of directors at anytime 
as of october    shares remained authorized for repurchase 
we anticipate repurchasing a significant portion of these shares during fiscal in addition  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share on april  through a dutch auction tender offer 
the following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except for per share data fiscal years ended october shares of common stock purchased cost to repurchase common stock average price paid per share off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations it is not our usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements  except for off balance sheet arrangements related to our customer financing activities and inventory purchase commitments described below as well as operating lease commitments and currency contracts disclosed in the contractual obligations table below 
moreover  it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
wholesale financing 
toro credit company tcc  a wholly owned financing subsidiary  provides financing for our north american toro distributors and approximately domestic dealers for select products that we manufacture 
independent north american toro and exmark distributors and dealers that do not finance through tcc generally finance their inventories with third party financing companies 
tcc and other third party financing companies purchase selected receivables from us and our distributors and dealers for extended periods that assists our distributors and dealers to carry representative inventories of products 
down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor or dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
we retain a security interest in the distributors and dealers inventories  and make periodic physical checks of those inventories 
under the sales terms to distributors and dealers  finance charges are applied to outstanding balances from the earlier of the date when product is sold to a customer  or the expiration of company supported finance terms granted at the time of sale  until payment is received by tcc or the third party finance company 
rates are generally fixed or based on the prime rate plus a fixed percentage depending on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
distributors and dealers cannot cancel purchases after goods are shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers 
third party financing companies purchased million of receivables of our financed products during fiscal the outstanding receivable balance owed from our distributors and dealers to third party financing companies was million on 
table of contents october  our maximum exposure for credit recourse with a third party financing company related to receivables under these financing arrangements was million as of october  we also enter into limited inventory repurchase agreements with third party financing companies 
as of october   we were contingently liable to repurchase up to million of inventory related to receivables under these financing arrangements 
we have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory from third party financing companies over the past three years 
however  a decline in retail sales could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product 
end user financing 
we have an agreement with a third party financing company to provide lease financing options to domestic golf course and grounds equipment customers 
the purpose of the agreement is to increase sales by giving end user buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
under the terms of this agreement  we could be contingently liable for a portion of the credit collection and residual value risk on the underlying equipment for leasing transactions financed under this program 
our maximum exposure for credit collection and residual value as of october  was million 
we have established a reserve for our estimated exposure related to this program 
in the normal course of business  we have arrangements with other financial institutions to provide various forms of financing options to end user customers 
from time to time  our company owned distributorships also guarantee the residual value at the end of leases with third party financing companies for product sold to customers 
the amount of this potential contingent liability as of october  was million 
none of these other arrangements require any additional material financial involvement by us 
termination of our end user financing arrangements  any material change to the terms in the financing arrangements  availability of credit for our customers  or any delay in securing replacement credit sources could have a material impact on our future operating results  however  we do not anticipate those items are likely to occur 
distributor financing 
we enter into long term loan agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or to facilitate ownership changes 
as of october  and  we have loaned and or invested million and million  respectively  in several distribution companies 
the increase of million was mainly the result of account receivable balances refinanced to long term loans for a distributor 
this amount is included in other current and long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
purchase commitments 
we have purchase commitments with some suppliers for materials and supplies as part of the normal course of business 
there are a limited number of supply contracts that contain penalty provisions for failure to purchase contracted quantities 
we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 
this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes assumed by reference to historical experience and current business plans 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period dollars in thousands less than after contractual obligation year years years years total long term debt purchase obligations operating leases currency contracts total as of october   we also had million in outstanding letters of credit issued during the normal course of business  as required by some vendor contracts 
market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures that arise from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we evaluate our exposures on a global basis to take advantage of netting opportunities that exist 
for the remaining exposures  our risk management policy is to hedge exposure to certain risks by entering into various hedging instruments to minimize market risk 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our stock 
additional information is presented in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we experienced rising prices for steel and other commodities that had a negative impact on our gross margins and net earnings 
given the worldwide steel market conditions  we anticipate average prices paid for steel based raw materials and component parts to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation and changing prices 
as previously mentioned  we experienced rising prices for steel and other commodities during fiscal that had a negative impact on our gross margins and net earnings 
in fiscal  we expect average prices of steel and other commodities to be higher than the average prices paid in fiscal we will 
table of contents attempt to mitigate the impact of these anticipated increases in steel and other commodity prices and other inflationary pressures by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts and introducing price increases 
investment in affiliate and divestiture in fiscal  we entered into a joint venture agreement with a leading engine manufacturer to source two cycle snow thrower engines for us and other customers 
we have determined that this new entity is a variable interest entity under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
we have determined that we are not required to consolidate the entity because we are not the primary beneficiary 
during fiscal  no material transactions were recorded in this joint venture 
in fiscal  we completed the sale of our southeastern based us distributorship  which was acquired in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we also completed the sale of our southwestern based us distribution company 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances  historical experience  and actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the following warranty reserve 
warranty coverage on our products ranges from a period of six months to seven years  and covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs  provided operator abuse  improper use or negligence did not necessitate the repair 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty reserve by product line for estimated costs in connection with future warranty claims 
we also establish reserves for major rework campaigns upon approval 
the amount of our warranty reserves is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty  historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims  the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation of such factors as performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers  product failure rates  and higher or lower than expected service costs for a repair 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims  our actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
an unexpected increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in our warranty accrual and a decrease in our net earnings 
as of october   we had million accrued related to future estimated warranty claims 
accounts and notes receivable valuation 
we value accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
each quarter  we estimate our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions of key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that we believe are uncollectible  as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known 
portions of our accounts receivable are protected by a security interest in products held by customers  which minimizes our collection exposure 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer or a significant slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable 
we believe that an analysis of historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger uncollectible accounts reserve is appropriate  we would record a 
table of contents credit or charge to selling  general  and administrative expense in the period that we made such a determination 
as of october   we had million reserved against our accounts and notes receivable 
new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
and will adopt it on november   as required 
effective november   we voluntarily adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that stock based compensation  including stock options  be recognized as expense at fair value from the date of grant to the vesting date 
under the fair value method of accounting  stock based compensation will be measured at the date of grant using a black scholes valuation method 
the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to result in a net earnings per diluted share benefit ranging from to in fiscal the impact is based on recording expense for the fair value of stock options granted and the change from variable to fixed value method of accounting related to our performance share plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
see further discussions on these market risks below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging activities involve the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from currency fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes  and not for trading purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries as well as sales to third party customers  purchases from suppliers  and bank lines of credit with creditors denominated in foreign currencies 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro  the japanese yen  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  and the mexican peso against the us dollar 
we enter into various contracts  principally forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  anticipated sales  and probable commitments 
decisions on whether to use such contracts are made based on the amount of exposures to the currency involved and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
therefore  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
during fiscal  the amount of losses reclassified to earnings for such cash flow hedges was million 
the following foreign currency exchange contracts held by us have maturity dates in fiscal all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
some derivative instruments we enter into do not meet the hedging criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in other income  net 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  pre tax value of derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl  and fair value impact of derivative instruments in other income  net as of and for the fiscal year ended october  were as follows value in fair value dollars in thousands average aocl impact except average contracted notional income gain contracted rate rate amount loss loss buy us sell canadian dollar buy us sell australian dollar buy us sell euro buy australian dollar sell us buy british pound sell us buy japanese yen sell us buy mexican peso sell us 
table of contents our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  and would not impact net earnings 
interest rate risk 
our market risk on interest rates relates primarily to libor based short term debt from commercial banks as well as the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
however  we do not have a cash flow or earnings exposure due to market risks on long term debt 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of october   our financial liabilities with exposure to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of million of short term debt outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percent basis points in short term interest rates  with all other variables remaining constant including the average balance of short term debt outstanding during fiscal  interest expense would have increased million in fiscal included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on our long term debt obligations 
as of october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying value of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed 
commodity risk 
some raw materials used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage some of this risk by using a combination of short and long term agreements with some vendors 
the primary commodity price exposures are with steel  aluminum  plastic resin  and linerboard 
further information regarding rising prices for steel and other commodities is presented in item  section entitled inflation 
equity price risk 
the trading price of toro common stock impacts compensation expense related to our stock based compensation plans for our performance share plan 
as the price of toro common stock rises  our compensation expense for our performance share plan increases 
our exposure to equity price risk will be substantially reduced after we adopt the provisions of sfas no 
additional information is presented in item  section entitled new accounting pronouncements to be adopted 
further information is also presented in note to our consolidated financial statements regarding our stock based compensation plans
