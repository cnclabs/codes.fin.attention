critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debt allowances  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  restructuring reserves  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
note to consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require substantial judgment on the part of management 
these critical accounting policies and the effect that changes in management s estimates could have on our consolidated financial statements are further described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition including subsequent interpretations 
we primarily sell our consumer software products through two channels oems and distributors 
for software product sales to oems  revenues are generally recognized based on reported product shipments from oems to their customers provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is probable 
for arrangements in which all elements are not delivered at the point of reported product shipment eg  there is an ongoing obligation to provide upgrades or support services  revenues are deferred and amortized over the fulfillment period 
for software product sales to distributors  revenues are recognized upon product shipment to the distributors or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is probable 
our distributor arrangements provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
additionally  we permit our distributors to return products in certain circumstances  generally during periods of product transition 
end users additionally have the right to return their product within days of the purchase 
we establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sab these allowances are recorded as a direct reduction of revenues and as an accrued 
table of contents liability 
management applies significant judgment and relies on historical experience in establishing these allowances 
if future return patterns differ from past return patterns  due to reduced demand for our product or other factors beyond our control  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 
if at any point in the future we become unable to estimate returns reliably  we could be required to defer recognizing revenues until the distributor notifies us that the product has been sold to an end user 
we utilize mail in rebates mirs as a marketing tool to promote our products and acquire new customers 
estimated redemption of mirs is recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and is accrued at the date the related revenues are recognized 
estimates are based upon historical redemption rates and current market factors 
for direct software product sales to end users  revenues are recognized upon shipment by us to the end users  provided all appropriate revenue recognition criteria have been met 
costs related to post contract customer support pcs are accrued at the date the related revenues are recognized 
pcs obligations relate to telephone support  and minor bug fixes and updates are downloadable from our web site 
as no separate charge is made for the pcs and the pcs is available for a period of less than one year  we do not ascribe any value to the pcs or defer any portion of revenues for it 
if pcs services become a more significant portion of our costs or we make it available for more than one year  we may be required to assign a portion of our revenues to pcs and recognize those revenues over the period of the pcs services 
for month to month subscribers of our online music division  the monthly service billing is recognized as billed 
for subscription sales greater than one month such as our annual subscription plan  customers pay in advance 
these revenues and associated credit card costs are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
revenues from sales of individual songs or albums are recognized at the time the music is delivered  digitally  to the end user 
revenues from pre paid cards are deferred and then recognized as tracks are downloaded by the end users 
revenues from licensees of napster merchandising rights are recognized upon receipt of royalty reports from the licensee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
generally  our customer payment terms do not exceed days 
in addition  we maintain a separate reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category and an analysis of our historical experience of bad debts 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for any build up to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
one customer accounted for of accounts receivable at march  and at march  a second customer accounted for of accounts receivable at march  and at march no other customer accounted for more than of accounts receivable at march  two additional customers accounted for and  respectively  of our accounts receivable at march  the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable  including changes in general economic conditions  may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill and other intangible assets  property and equipment  and prepaid content fees for our online music business 
we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  significant changes in general economic conditions  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business  difficulty or delays in integrating an acquired business or a significant change in the operations of our business 

table of contents recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
estimating these cash flows requires management to make judgments about growth in demand for our products  sustainability of gross margins and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of our long lived assets 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
in lieu of amortization  roxio is required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill balance on at least an annual basis  upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of roxio s reporting units below their carrying value 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we currently operate two reportable segments  consumer software and online music  which are also reporting units for purposes of sfas no 
because roxio constituted two reporting units at march   this test has been performed separately on a reporting unit basis 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
we completed our annual review during the fourth quarter of based on impairment tests performed with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm  there was no impairment of our goodwill in fiscal investments in non consolidated company 
we have made an investment in an early stage private company  yesvideo 
this investment is accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over this company s operations 
we periodically monitor this investment for impairment and will record a reduction in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based upon information that we request from this privately held company 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for this evaluation is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from this company 
as part of the evaluation process  the review includes  but is not limited to  a review of yesvideo s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
if we determine that the carrying value of yesvideo is at an amount above fair value  or if yesvideo completes a financing based upon a valuation significantly lower than our initial investment  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down would be recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 

table of contents at march   we had invested million in yesvideo 
if yesvideo does not complete an initial public offering or is not acquired by a publicly traded company for cash  in excess of our basis  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell it at a gain or even recover our investment 
the prolonged general decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any additional declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on this investment 
as of march   we had recorded no loss on this investment in yesvideo 
restructuring accrual 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charge was primarily due to the reorganization of our european  canadian  japanese and domestic operations 
we recorded this restructuring charge in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for exit costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
in order to determine our restructuring charge and corresponding liability  sfas required us to make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included estimated sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we developed these assumptions based on our understanding of the current real estate market as well as current market interest rates 
the assumptions used are our management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
product development costs 
costs for the development of new software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional development costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
for all software development projects to date  management has determined that under our current software development process  the product is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and accrued liabilities and other provisions  not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

table of contents retail revenues retail revenues consist of sales to distributors and direct sales to end users 
retail revenues decreased or million in fiscal from fiscal this decrease is due to the divestiture of our goback product line which resulted in a decrease of million  an increase in provision for expected returns of million  mostly attributable to easy cd dvd creator product returns resulting from the version release  and the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to fewer new version releases of our software products in fiscal as compared to fiscal retail revenues increased or million from fiscal to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the launches of easy cd dvd creator and winoncd in fiscal  as well as sales of products acquired through the acquisition of mgi software in january we expect that retail revenues will increase slightly in the future due to the release of easy media creator in the fourth quarter of fiscal oem revenues oem revenues consist of sales to oems such as pc manufacturers and cd and dvd recordable drive manufacturers and integrators 
oem revenues decreased or million in fiscal from fiscal oem revenues decreased or million from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in both fiscal years was primarily due to lower per unit royalty rates and a decrease in the number of oem manufacturers shipping our products 
in the future  we anticipate that cd and dvd recording technology revenues from our sales to oems will continue to decline in total  on a per unit basis and as a percentage of total net revenues  as a result of increased competition in the maturing cd and dvd recording technology 
in particular  beginning in october  a significant customer  dell computer corporation  now only bundles our cd and dvd recording technology with their commercial desktop sales 
as a result  revenues from this customer declined by million in fiscal online music revenues online music revenues consist of revenues generated from our online music subscription service and purchases of individual tracks or albums on an a la carte basis 
we began to generate online music revenues with the acquisition of napster  llc in may fiscal 
online music revenues were million in fiscal we anticipate that net revenues from our online music distribution division will continue to increase in the future as a result of continued marketing activities and a number of initiatives planned to drive customer growth and move into international markets 
international revenues international revenues accounted for approximately million or of net revenues in fiscal and million or of net revenues in fiscal for both years  the decrease in international revenues is primarily due to declining oem sales and increased competition for our retail software products 
international revenue for fiscal year is impractible to obtain 
we anticipate that in the future international revenues will not fluctuate significantly as a percentage of our total sales 
gross margin the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consumer software gross margin and online music gross margin as a percentage of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended march  consumer software online music 
table of contents note effect of amortization of purchased technologies has been included in the gross margin discussed below 
gross margin is the percentage of profit from net revenues after deducting cost of revenues  which includes costs related to the physical goods shipped  third party licensed intellectual property  freight  warranty  end user technical support  scrap and royalties to content providers 
our gross margin from oem revenues is generally significantly higher than our gross margin from retail revenues primarily due to lower product costs and to a lesser extent due to a different level of product support effort associated with oem sales compared to retail sales 
for sales of our products through oems  the oems are responsible for the first level of product support and we only provide a second level of support to the oem 
our technical support costs as a percentage of our revenues have declined as a result of the consolidation of these services into our canadian facility during fiscal as well as changes in the levels of support currently provided to end users 
gross margin for the consumer software division decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the margin was primarily a result of the change in sales mix to a higher percentage of retail sales  which carry a lower margin  and a lower percentage of product licensing sales to oems  which carry a higher margin  and a four percentage point increase in the cost of royalty expenses 
these gross margin increases were partially offset by a decrease of one percentage point in standard costs on our retail products and a decrease of two percentage points in reduced technical support costs 
gross margin for the consumer software division decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the margin was primarily a result of the change in sales mix to a higher percentage of retail sales  which carry a lower margin  and a lower percentage of product licensing sales to oems  which carry a higher margin  increases in the cost of technical support services and royalty expenses and increased amortization of purchased technologies in fiscal as a percentage of cost of revenues 
we believe that our gross margin percentage for the software division will increase slightly in the future as a result of restructuring efforts in fiscal that have improved our gross margins going forward 
gross margin for the online music division represented of our net revenues in fiscal the lower gross margin for the online music distribution compared to the software division is due to differences in the composition of cost of sales in the online music business model 
we anticipate that our gross margin percentages for the online music distribution division will improve slightly in the future as we grow the business and achieve economies of scale 
operating expenses we primarily classify operating expenses as research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials and expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions 
in addition  we include restructuring charges  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation charges as operating expenses

research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits  and contractors fees for our development and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and development of new products 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and other related expenses of million attributable to the acquisition of napster  llc in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses related to the software division of million primarily due to headcount reductions related to our restructuring efforts during fiscal research and development expenses remained consistent during fiscal from fiscal in fiscal  there was an increase in payroll and related costs of million and an increase in rental expense of million  primarily attributable to facilities associated with our acquisition of mgi software 
however  this increase was substantially offset by a reduction in bonus expense of million  a reduction in outside services expense of  and a reduction in various other expenses of million 
research and development headcount was at march   at march  and at march  during fiscal  research and development headcount increased by new employees from napster  llc  offset by a net reduction of research and development personnel in the consumer software division 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will decrease in the future as the result of our continued cost control efforts 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions and benefits for sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with advertising and promotions

recent accounting pronouncements share based payments on march   the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in 
table of contents which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the proposed standard would require that the modified prospective method be used  which requires that the fair value of new awards granted from the beginning of the year of adoption  plus unvested awards at the date of adoption  be expensed over the vesting period 
in addition  the proposed statement encourages companies to use the binomial approach to value stock options  which differs from the black scholes option pricing model that we currently use

accounting for consolidations of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  which subsequently has been revised by fin r 
the primary objectives of fin r are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights called variable interest entities or vies and on how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions and  as part of our cash management process  we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
amounts deposited with these institutions may exceed federal depository insurance limits 
in addition  the portfolio of investments conforms to our policy regarding concentration of investments  maximum maturity and quality of investment 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agencies securities  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
all of our short term investments mature in less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  commercial paper and municipal securities  which are not included in the table because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
maturing in less than one year more than one year total estimated fair value dollars in thousands short term investments weighted average interest rate we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
we have available to us a million revolving line of credit 
currently  there is million outstanding under the line 
table of contents of credit that bears interest at a variable rate of prime rate plus per annum and expires in march we do not hold any other variable interest rate debt 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 
exchange rate risk we develop our software in the united states  canada and europe  and sell it in north america  europe  the pacific rim and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period 
exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign entity financial statements are included as a component of other comprehensive income and have not been significant for all periods presented 
for foreign subsidiaries  certain assets and liabilities are re measured at the period end or historical rates as appropriate 
revenues and expenses are re measured at the average rate during the period 
currency translation gains and losses are recognized in current operations 
we sell our consumer software products primarily to original equipment manufacturers and distributors throughout the world  resulting in sales denominated in us dollars  euro  and japanese yen
