item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world 
we sell a full range of agricultural equipment  including tractors  combines  hay tools  sprayers  forage equipment and implements 
our products are marketed under the following brand names agco  agcoallis  agcostar  ag chem  challenger  farmhand  fendt  fieldstar  gleaner  glencoe  hesston  lor al  massey ferguson  new idea  rogator  soilteq tm  spra coupe  sunflower  terra gator  tye  white and willmar 
we distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately  independent dealers  distributors  associates and licensees 
in addition  we provide retail financing in north america  the united kingdom  france  germany  ireland and brazil through our finance joint ventures with rabobank 
as a result of the valtra acquisition consummated on january   see recent acquisitions we also began marketing under the valtra and sisudiesel tm brand names 
depending on the markets  we distribute these products directly to end customers or through valtra s independent dealers and distributors 
results of operations we sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers  distributors and other customers 
a large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to the end user 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory 
however  retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons 
in certain markets  particularly in north america  there is often a time lag  which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand  between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer s sale to a retail customer 
during this time lag between the wholesale and retail sale  dealers may not return equipment to us unless the dealer s contract is terminated or we agree to accept returned products 
in most cases  commissions payable under our salesman incentive programs are paid at the time of the retail sale  as opposed to when the products are sold to dealers

recent acquisitions on january   we acquired the valtra tractor and diesel engine operations of kone corporation  a finnish company  for million  net of approximately million cash acquired or approximately million  subject to customary closing adjustments 
valtra is a global tractor and off road engine manufacturer with market leadership positions in the nordic region of europe and latin america 
valtra is known for its strong engineering and technical skills in tractor and diesel engine manufacturing  which allow it to produce high quality products in an efficient and expedited manner 
in addition  valtra has a unique and highly effective direct sales network in certain markets which  together with valtra s made to order manufacturing process  has allowed it to achieve significant market share in its core markets 
valtra has focused on becoming a market leader in the industry in terms of returns and margins rather than market share 
we will account for the valtra acquisition in accordance with statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  the purchase price will be allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date

we have applied to the brazilian competition authority for its approval of the purchase of valtra 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty when or whether the brazilian competition authority will grant its approval 
under brazilian law  we were permitted to complete the purchase of valtra without having received such approval  however  the brazilian competition authority has  while considering our request for approval  imposed conditions on how we operate both valtra s brazilian business and our existing brazilian business 
these conditions include a requirement to maintain all manufacturing facilities  brands  products and distribution channels that existed prior to the acquisition 
the timing and the conditions of such approval may delay or prevent us from fully executing our business plan for operating the valtra business and our existing business or may force us to sell a portion of the valtra business or our existing business 
any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
on november   we completed the acquisition of sunflower manufacturing co  inc  a former product line of spx corporation 
sunflower is a leading producer of tillage  seeding and specialty harvesting equipment serving the north american market

during the first quarter of  all costs in connection with the liabilities established had been incurred 
accordingly  we adjusted our purchase price allocation to reflect a reduction in these established liabilities by million 
in addition  we finalized our purchase price allocation  resulting in a net total goodwill adjustment of approximately million 
the adjustment primarily related to the reflection of final appraised values of property  plant and equipment acquired and the establishment of certain liabilities related to outstanding litigation and warranty obligations 
restructuring and other infrequent expenses dekalb rationalization on march   we announced the closure of the challenger track tractor facility located in dekalb  illinois and the relocation of production to our facility in jackson  minnesota 
the dekalb plant assembled challenger track tractors in the range of to horsepower 
after a review of cost reduction alternatives  it was determined that current and future production levels at that time were not sufficient to support a stand alone track tractor site 
production at the dekalb facility ceased in may and was relocated and resumed in the minnesota facility in june we anticipate that the facility rationalization will generate annual savings of approximately million by the total cash closure costs of approximately million will be largely offset by expected proceeds from the sale of the dekalb site  which we are actively marketing for sale 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded approximately million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses during the components of the restructuring expenses are summarized in the following table facility write down relocation of property  employee and facility plant and employee retention transition closure equipment severance payments costs costs total provision less non cash expense cash expense cash activity balances as of december  the write down of property  plant and equipment represents the impairment of real estate resulting from the facility closure and was based upon the estimated fair value of the assets compared to their carrying value 
the estimated fair value of the real estate was determined based on current conditions in the market 
the severance costs relate to the termination of employees following the completion of production at the dekalb facility 
as of december   all employees have been terminated 
the employee retention 
table of contents payments relate to incentives paid to dekalb employees who remained employed until certain future termination dates and were accrued over the term of the retention period 
the severance costs were also accrued over the term of the retention period  as employees were entitled to severance payments only if they remained in service through their scheduled termination dates 
certain employees relocated to the jackson  minnesota facility  and costs associated with relocation were expensed as incurred 
a portion of the machinery and equipment and all tooling located at dekalb were relocated to the jackson  minnesota facility during the second quarter 
the remaining portion of machinery and equipment will be sold or disposed 
the buildings  land and improvements are being marketed for sale 
coventry rationalization during  we announced and initiated a restructuring plan related to the closure of our tractor manufacturing facility in coventry  england and the relocation of existing production at coventry to our beauvais  france and canoas  brazil manufacturing facilities 
the closure of this facility was consistent with our strategy to reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
the facility manufactured transaxles and assembled tractors in the range of horsepower 
the trend to higher horsepower tractors resulting from the consolidation of farms had caused this product segment of the industry to decline over recent years  which negatively impacted the facility s utilization 
in  we completed the transfer of production and experienced cost inefficiencies and production delays at our beauvais facility primarily due to supplier delivery issues 
we anticipate that these inefficiencies will be eliminated in  resulting in a reduction of cost of sales in as compared to the anticipated annual savings related to the closure are dependent upon the elimination of such inefficiencies 
as of december   we had recorded approximately million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses in connection with the restructuring plan 
the components of the restructuring expenses are summarized in the following table write down of property  employee facility plant and employee retention closure equipment severance payments costs total provision less non cash expense cash expense cash activity balances as of december  provision cash activity foreign currency translation balances as of december  the write down of property  plant and equipment represents the impairment of machinery and equipment resulting from the facility closure and was based on the estimated fair value of the assets compared to their carrying value 
the estimated fair value of the equipment was determined based on current conditions in the market 
the machinery  equipment and tooling will be disposed of after production ceases and the buildings  land and improvements are being marketed for sale 
the severance costs relate to the termination of  employees 
as of december    employees have been terminated 
the employee retention payments relate to incentives paid to coventry employees who remain employed until certain future termination dates and are accrued over the term of the retention period 
the facility closure costs include certain noncancelable operating lease terminations and other facility exit costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold machinery and equipment at auction and as a result of those sales  we recognized a net gain of approximately million 
this gain has been reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the million of restructuring costs accrued at december  are expected to be incurred during on january   we sold the land  buildings and 
table of contents improvements of the coventry facility for approximately million 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in october  we applied to the high court in london  england  for clarification of a provision in our uk pension plan that governs the value of pension payments payable to an employee who is over years old and who retires from service in certain circumstances prior to his normal retirement date 
see business legal proceedings for additional information 
the primary matter before the high court was whether pension payments to such employees  including those who take early retirement and those terminated due to the closure of our coventry facility  should be reduced to compensate for the fact that the pension payments begin prior to a normal retirement age of in december  the high court ruled against our position that reduced pension payments are payable in the context of early retirements or terminations 
we appealed the high court s ruling  and in july  the court of appeal ruled that employees terminated as a result of the closure of the coventry facility do not qualify for full pensions  thereby reversing the earlier high court ruling for this aspect of the case  but ruled that other employees might qualify 
the court of appeal ruling is subject to further appeal 
the representatives of the beneficiaries of the pension plan have sought the right to appeal to the house of lords and the house of lords has yet to conclude on the matter 
as a result of the court s ruling in that case  certain employees who took early retirement in prior years under voluntary retirement arrangements would be entitled to additional payments  and therefore we recorded a charge in the second quarter of  included in restructuring and other infrequent expenses  of approximately million to reflect our current estimate of the additional pension liability associated with previous early retirement programs 
in the event that the court of appeal ruling is successfully challenged  we may incur an additional pension liability within the range of approximately million to million 
the timing of our obligation to fund cash into the pension plan with respect to this increased liability  as well as our existing liabilities  depends on many factors  including the overall funded status of the plan and the investment returns of the plan s assets and is the subject of ongoing negotiations with representatives of the beneficiaries of the pension plan 
and functional rationalizations during  we initiated several rationalization plans and recorded restructuring and other infrequent expenses of million 
the expenses primarily related to severance costs and certain lease termination and other exit costs associated with the rationalization of our european engineering and marketing personnel  certain components of our german manufacturing facilities located in kempten and marktoberdorf  germany and the restructuring of our north american information systems function 
these rationalizations were completed to improve our on going cost structure and reduce cost of goods sold  as well as engineering and sg a expenses 
during the year ended december   we recorded an additional million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses associated with the rationalization initiatives in germany as well as a european combine engineering rationalization that was initiated during a total of million of severance costs have been recorded associated with these activities  and relate to the termination of approximately employees in total 
at december   a total of approximately million of expenses had been incurred and paid 
the remaining accrued balance of million as of december  is expected to be incurred during ag chem acquisition integration in  we announced our plans to rationalize certain facilities as part of the ag chem acquisition integration 
we consolidated our willmar  minnesota manufacturing facility and ag chem s benson  minnesota manufacturing facility into ag chem s jackson  minnesota manufacturing plant 
in addition  we closed ag chem s minnetonka  minnesota administrative offices and relocated all functions to the jackson facility 
we also closed fifteen parts and service facilities and integrated parts warehousing and logistics into our north american parts distribution system 
we completed these closures in order to achieve an overall reduction of cost of goods sold and operating expenses for the combined businesses 
we believe that all key aspects of the restructuring plan were successfully executed 
the targeted synergies of approximately 
table of contents million were offset by a decline in industry demand  which impacted our sales  production levels and cost structure 
all employees identified in the restructuring plan had been terminated as of the end of the first quarter of employee retention payments related to incentives paid to ag chem and agco employees who remained employed until certain future termination dates were accrued over the term of the retention period 
we incurred facility closure costs  which included employee relocation costs and other exit costs at our willmar location after operations ceased 
the facility relocation and transition costs were expensed as incurred and represented costs to relocate inventory and machinery and costs to integrate operations into the remaining facilities 
there were no remaining costs accrued related to these rationalizations as of december  and there were no costs incurred related to this rationalization during the components of the restructuring expenses are summarized in the following table in millions write down facility of property  employee facility relocation plant and employee retention closure and transition equipment severance payments costs costs total provision less non cash expense cash expense cash activity balances as of december  provision reversal of provision cash activity balances as of december  after production ceased at the willmar facility and manufacturing had been consolidated into jackson  minnesota  the company began marketing the willmar facility and real estate for sale  along with the other closed facilities 
the benson and minnetonka facilities and several of the parts and service facilities were sold during and during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the carrying value of the real estate of the willmar facility to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the real estate was determined based on current conditions in the market 
the write down of the real estate of approximately million was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
through manufacturing facility rationalizations in  we permanently closed our combine manufacturing facility in independence  missouri and our lockney  texas and noetinger  argentina implement manufacturing facilities 
in  we permanently closed our coldwater  ohio manufacturing facility 
the majority of production in these facilities has been relocated to existing facilities or outsourced to third parties 
the closure of these facilities was consistent with our strategy to reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
due to declines in industry demand since  we determined the closure of these facilities and redeployment of the majority of production to other existing facilities and the remaining production to third party suppliers was necessary to address the excess capacity in our united states and south american manufacturing plants 
the manufacturing facility rationalization resulted in significant cost savings and improved the overall competitiveness of implements  hay equipment  high horsepower tractors and combines produced in these plants 
the rationalization of these production facilities is expected to generate annual cost savings of million to million from the elimination of production overhead costs and other inefficiencies 
we believe these efficiencies were substantially achieved in  and we expensed approximately million and million associated with these rationalizations during and  respectively  and had million of costs accrued related to these rationalizations as of december  we did not record any additional restructuring and other infrequent expenses in or related to these closures 
we incurred and paid approximately million of 
table of contents expenses in each of the years ending december  and  respectively 
there are no remaining costs accrued related to these rationalizations as of december  in addition  during  we sold our closed manufacturing facilities in independence  missouri and coldwater  ohio 
a net gain on the sale of these two facilities of million was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our application of the policies discussed below involve significant levels of judgments  estimates and complexity 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by actively monitoring the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  we also consider other economic factors such as aging trends 
we believe that our process of specific review of customers combined with overall analytical review provides an effective evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
our loss experience was approximately of net sales in allowances for discounts and sales incentives are made at the time of sale based on retail sales incentive programs available to the dealer or retail customer 
the cost of these programs depends on various factors including the timing of the retail sale and the programs in place at that time 
these retail sales incentives may also be revised between the time we record the sale and the time the retail sale occurs 
we monitor these factors and revise our provisions when necessary 
at december   we had recorded an allowance for discounts and sales incentives of approximately million 
if we were to allow an additional of sales incentives and discounts at the time of retail sale  our reserve would increase by approximately million as of december  conversely  if we were to decrease our sales incentives and discounts by at the time of retail sale  our reserve would decrease by approximately million 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
determination of cost includes estimates for surplus and obsolete inventory based on estimates of future sales and production 
changes in demand and product design can impact these estimates 
we periodically evaluate and update our assumptions when assessing the adequacy of inventory adjustments 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  in certain tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
in  we recognized a non cash income tax charge of million related to increasing the valuation allowance for certain united states deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from future taxable income and determined that an adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate in  and we have not benefited losses generated in the united states in at december  and  we had deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  related to net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  and  we had recorded total valuation allowances as an offset to the deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the united states net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the remaining net deferred tax assets depends on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents we make provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties at the time products are sold 
we base these estimates on historical experience of the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
we frequently review warranty trends to monitor our estimates and develop actions to minimize future claims 
we provide insurance reserves for our estimates of losses due to claims for worker s compensation  product liability and other liabilities for which we are self insured 
we base these estimates on the ultimate settlement amount of claims  which often have long periods of resolution 
we closely monitor the claims to maintain adequate reserves 
we account for our defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states and the united kingdom 
we base the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans on the moody s investor service aa bond yield as of december of each year 
for our uk and german pension plans  we base the discount rate on comparable indices within each of those countries 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us plans were decreased by basis points  our projected benefit plan obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by a nominal amount 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our uk plans were decreased by basis points  our projected benefit plan obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by million 
we are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether or not they may  when resolved  have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
see business legal proceedings for discussion of our application to the high court in london  england for clarification of a provision in our united kingdom pension plan that governs the value of pension payments payable to an employee who retires from service in certain circumstances prior to his normal retirement date 
as a result of the ruling in that case  certain employees who took early retirement in prior years under voluntary retirement arrangements would be entitled to additional payments  and therefore we recorded a charge in the second quarter of  included in restructuring expenses  of approximately million to reflect our current estimate of the additional pension liability associated with previous early retirement programs 
in the event that the court of appeal ruling is successfully challenged  we may incur an additional pension liability within the range of approximately to million 
the timing of our obligation to fund cash into the pension plan with respect to this increased liability  as well as our existing liabilities  depends on many factors  including the overall funded status of the plan and the investment returns of the plan s assets and is the subject of ongoing negotiations with representatives of the beneficiaries of the pension plan 
the goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks in each of our segments were tested for impairment during the first quarter of as required by sfas no 
sfas no 
established a new method of testing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
this assessment involves determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units including trademarks in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exists 
fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units 
we utilized a combination of valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow approach  a market multiple approach and a comparable transaction approach 
based on this evaluation we determined that goodwill associated with our argentina and north america reporting units was impaired and recorded a pre tax write down of goodwill of million  which was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of million of taxes  in the first quarter of we conducted our annual analyses as of october  and  respectively  and determined no further reduction in the carrying amount of goodwill was required in or we will 
table of contents conduct analyses on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
due to the level of judgment  complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved  actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements 
adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels 
internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources  primarily our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities 
subsequent to the completion of the funding of the valtra acquisition which closed january   our primary financing and funding sources are the million principal amount convertible senior subordinated notes due  the million principal amount senior subordinated notes due  the million principal amount senior notes due  approximately million of accounts receivable securitization facilities  and a new multi currency revolving credit facility of million  a million united states dollar denominated term loan facility and a million euro denominated term loan facility 
on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due under a private placement offering 
the convertible senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are convertible into shares of our common stock upon satisfaction of certain conditions  as discussed below 
interest is payable on the notes at per annum  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on june and december of each year  beginning june  the convertible senior subordinated notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an effective price of per share  subject to adjustment 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  before close of business on december   only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after march   if the closing sales price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after a five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  as defined 
beginning january   we may redeem any of the notes at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest on december     and the senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time at of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes were issued in at of their principal amount 
the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes requires us to offer to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of the repurchase  in the event of a change in control

during  we utilized a million multi currency revolving credit facility 
this facility was replaced january  with a new multi currency revolving credit facility discussed further below 
the old facility was secured by a majority of our united states  canadian and united kingdom based assets and a pledge of a portion of the stock of our domestic and material foreign subsidiaries 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings during was 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and availability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had borrowings of million and availability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
million of the outstanding borrowings as of december  were payable in canadian dollars 
on january   we entered into a new credit facility that provides for a million multi currency revolving credit facility  a million us dollar denominated term loan and a million or approximately million euro denominated term loan 
the revolving credit facility will mature in january the maturity date of the revolving credit facility can be extended to march if our existing senior subordinated notes due are refinanced on terms specified by the lenders prior to such date and further extended to december if our existing senior notes due are refinanced on terms specified by the lenders prior to such date 
both term loans will amortize at the rate of one percent per annum until the maturity date 
the maturity date for the term loans is january the maturity date of the term loans can be extended to march if the subordinated notes are refinanced on terms specified by the lender prior to such date and further extended to june if the senior notes are refinanced on terms specified by the lenders prior to such date 
the revolving credit and term facilities are secured by a majority of our us  canadian  finnish and us based assets and a pledge of a portion of the stock of our domestic and material foreign subsidiaries 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the facility  at our option  at either libor plus a margin ranging between and based upon our senior debt ratio or the higher of the administrative agent s base lending rate or one half of one percent over the federal funds rate plus a margin ranging between and based on our senior debt ratio 
the facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments  including dividends 
we must also fulfill financial covenants including  among others  a total debt to ebitda ratio  a senior debt to ebitda ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the facility 
in addition  the new credit facility requires us to issue at least million of common stock by january  as discussed above  we completed the initial funding of the million cash purchase price of valtra net of approximately million cash acquired through the issuance of million principal amount convertible senior subordinated notes  with funds borrowed under our new credit facility and million borrowed under an interim bridge loan facility 
the loans under the bridge facility were closed on january   and constitute unsecured senior subordinated obligations 
the bridge loan facility matures on january   and interest accrues on borrowings at an increasing rate of interest  currently  subject to a maximum rate of 
the bridge facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments  including dividends  and requires that the net proceeds from any issuances of stock or debt be used to prepay the bridge financing 
if the bridge financing has not been repaid by the first anniversary of the closing date  january   and there is not any other default or event of default under the bridge financing  then the bridge lenders may  with the approval of the holders of of the principal amount of the loans under the bridge facility  exchange all of the bridge loan for exchange notes which would mature on the tenth anniversary of the closing date 
we intend to permanently finance the valtra acquisition through the public sale of common stock and subordinated notes 
although we have not finalized the mix of common stock and debt that we will sell  we currently expect to issue approximately million in common stock and million of euro senior subordinated notes 
we expect to use the net proceeds of these offerings to repay amounts outstanding under our million bridge loan facility  to redeem our million principal amount of outstanding 
table of contents senior subordinated notes due  and to repay amounts outstanding under our new revolving credit and term loan facilities 
our business is subject to substantial cyclical variations  which generally are difficult to forecast 
our results of operations may also vary from time to time resulting from costs associated with rationalization plans and acquisitions 
as a result  we have had to request relief from our lenders on occasion with respect to financial covenant compliance 
while we do not currently anticipate asking for any relief  it is possible that we would require relief in the future 
based upon our historical working relationship with our lenders  we currently do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining that relief 
under our securitization facilities  we sell accounts receivable in the united states  canada and europe on a revolving basis to commercial paper conduits either on a direct basis or through a wholly owned special purpose entity 
at december   the aggregate amount of these facilities was million 
the outstanding funded balance of million as of december  has the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short term liabilities by the same amount 
our risk of loss under the securitization facilities is limited to a portion of the unfunded balance of receivables sold  which is approximately of the funded amount 
we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts associated with this risk 
if the facilities were terminated  we would not be required to repurchase previously sold receivables but would be prevented from selling additional receivables to the commercial paper conduit 
the us facility agreement provides that the agent  rabobank  has the right to terminate the securitization facility if our senior unsecured debt rating moves below bb by standard poor s or ba by moody s investor services 
based on our current ratings  a downgrade of two levels by standard poor s and one level by moody s would need to occur 
the canadian and european facility agreements provide that the agent  rabobank  has the right to terminate the securitization facilities if our senior unsecured debt rating moves below b by standard poor s or b by moody s investor services 
based on our current ratings  a downgrade of three levels by standard poor s and two levels by moody s would need to occur 
we are currently in discussions with the rating agencies and the conduit purchasers to have the ratings triggers eliminated from the agreements 
the securitization facilities expire in and but are subject to annual renewal 
these facilities allow us to sell accounts receivables through financing conduits which obtain funding from commercial paper markets 
future funding under securitization facilities depends upon the adequacy of receivables  a sufficient demand for the underlying commercial paper and the maintenance of certain covenants concerning the quality of the receivables and our financial condition 
in the event commercial paper demand is not adequate  our securitization facilities provide for liquidity backing from various financial institutions including rabobank 
these liquidity commitments would provide us with interim funding to allow us to find alternative sources of working capital financing  if necessary 
our working capital requirements are seasonal  with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year 
we had million in working capital at december   an increase of million from working capital of million at december  accounts receivable and inventories  combined  were million higher than at december  the increase is primarily due to currency translation  higher inventory levels related to the transition of production from closed manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of our gima joint venture as of july  cash flow provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million for the increase in operating cash flow is a result of higher earnings as described above offset by increases in working capital 
in addition  we had cash restructuring payments relating primarily to the closure of the coventry facility of million during compared to million in capital expenditures for were million compared to million in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to new product introductions  the consolidation of our gima joint venture as of july   capital additions associated with the transition of production from closed manufacturing facilities and the impact of currency translation 
including capital expenditures relating to the valtra acquisition  we anticipate that capital expenditures for the full year of will range from 
table of contents approximately million to million and will primarily be used to support the development and enhancement of new and existing products as well as facility  equipment and systems improvements 
our debt to capitalization ratio  which is total long term debt divided by the sum of total long term debt and stockholders equity  was at december   as compared to at december  our acquisition of valtra and our permanent financing of the acquisition will increase this ratio 
from time to time  we review and will continue to review acquisition and joint venture opportunities as well as changes in the capital markets 
if we were to consummate a significant acquisition or elect to take advantage of favorable opportunities in the capital markets  we may supplement availability or revise the terms under our credit facilities or complete public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  funding under the accounts receivable securitization facilities  available cash  and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual commitments the future payments required under our significant contractual obligations  excluding foreign currency forward contracts  as of december  are as follows in millions payments due by period to to and total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period to to and total beyond standby letters of credit and similar instruments guarantees total commercial commitments and lines of credit unconditional purchase obligations exclude routine purchase orders entered into in the normal course of business 
other long term obligations include estimates of future minimum contribution requirements under our us and us defined benefit pension plans 
these estimates are based on current legislation and are subject to change 
guarantees at december   we were obligated under certain circumstances to purchase  through the year  up to million of equipment upon expiration of certain operating leases between agco finance llc and agco finance canada ltd  our retail finance joint ventures in north america  and end users 
we also maintain a remarketing agreement with these joint ventures whereby we are obligated to repurchase repossessed inventory at market values 
on december   we entered into an agreement with agco finance llc which limits our purchase obligations under this arrangement to million in the aggregate 
table of contents per calendar year 
we believe that any losses  which might be incurred on the resale of this equipment  will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately million  primarily related to dealer and end user financing of equipment 
we believe the credit risk associated with these guarantees is not material to our financial position 
other at december   we had outstanding net foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
see foreign currency risk management for further information 
we have received assessments from brazilian tax authorities regarding transaction taxes payable on certain foreign currency gains and losses 
we are currently contesting the assessments and do not believe the calculation method applied by the tax authorities is correct 
we believe that it is not probable or likely the assessments will have to be paid 
the total assessment approximates million to million 
we anticipate that it may take significant time to resolve the dispute with the brazilian tax authorities 
related parties rabobank  a aaa rated financial institution based in the netherlands  is a owner in our retail finance joint ventures which are located in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  france  germany  spain  ireland and brazil 
rabobank is also the principal agent and participant in our revolving credit facility and our securitization facilities 
the majority of the assets of our retail finance joint ventures represent finance receivables 
the majority of the liabilities represent notes payable and accrued interest 
under the various joint venture agreements  rabobank or its affiliates are obligated to provide financing to the joint venture companies  primarily through lines of credit 
we do not guarantee the obligations of the retail finance joint ventures other than  or approximately million  of the solvency requirements of the brazil joint venture 
in brazil  our joint venture company has an agency relationship with rabobank whereby rabobank provides funding 
our retail finance joint ventures provide retail financing and wholesale financing to our dealers 
the terms of the financing arrangements offered to our dealers are similar to arrangements they provide to unaffiliated third parties 
as discussed previously  at december  we were obligated under certain circumstances to purchase through the year up to million of equipment upon expiration of certain operating leases between agco finance llc and agco finance canada ltd  our retail joint ventures in north america  and end users 
we also maintain a remarketing agreement with these joint ventures  as discussed under contractual commitments 
in addition  as part of sales incentives provided to end users  we may from time to time subsidize interest rates of retail financing provided by our retail joint ventures 
the cost of those programs is recognized at the time of sale to our dealers 
during and  we had net sales of approximately million and million  respectively  to baywa corporation  a german distributor  in the ordinary course of business 
the president and ceo of baywa corporation is a member of our board of directors 
during  we purchased approximately million of equipment components from our manufacturing joint venture  gima  at cost 
as of july   we began consolidating gima in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and interpretation of arb no

outlook our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry 
sales of our equipment have been and are expected to continue to be affected by changes in net cash farm income  farm land values  
table of contents weather conditions  the demand for agricultural commodities  farm industry related legislation and general economic conditions 
current industry fundamentals are favorable entering into with relatively high commodity prices contributing to strong farm income 
in north america  high farm income and favorable tax incentives are expected to stimulate an improvement in equipment demand in in europe  industry demand is expected to remain at or slightly below current levels due to the impact of drought conditions in  uncertainty surrounding common agricultural policy  or cap  reforms  and the impact of the strong euro on export demand 
increased demand from new eu entrants is expected to continue in south america industry demand is also expected to be at or slightly below levels 
brazilian government subsidized financing programs are expected to be reduced in  which is likely to moderate demand 
based on this current market outlook  agco expects net income to improve in resulting from the impact of new products  cost reduction initiatives  the elimination of production inefficiencies experienced in  and the reduction of restructuring and other infrequent expenses related to plant closures that occurred in agco s net sales are expected to increase in with growth to be achieved from the addition of valtra  the impact of new product introductions and the strengthening of the euro 
foreign currency risk management we have significant manufacturing operations in france  germany  brazil and denmark  and we purchase a portion of our tractors  combines and components from third party foreign suppliers  primarily in various european countries and in japan 
we also sell products in over countries throughout the world 
the majority of our revenue outside the united states is denominated in the currency of the customer location  with the exception of sales in the middle east  africa and asia where revenue is primarily denominated in british pounds  euros or united states dollars 
see segment reporting in note in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for sales by customer location 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real and the canadian dollar in relation to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we attempt to manage our transactional foreign exchange exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales 
where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur  we hedge certain  but not all  of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
our hedging policy prohibits foreign currency forward contracts for speculative trading purposes 
our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars is not hedged 
our most significant translation exposures are the euro and the brazilian real in relation to the united states dollar 
when practical  this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings 

table of contents the following is a summary of foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge currency exposures 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the net notional amounts and fair value gains or losses as of december  stated in united states dollars are as follows in millions  except average contract rate net notional average fair amount contract value buy sell rate gain loss australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro japanese yen mexican peso new zealand dollar norwegian krone south african rand swedish krona per united states dollar because these contracts were entered into for hedging purposes  the gains and losses on the contracts would largely be offset by gains and losses on the underlying firm commitment 
interest rates we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt and may in the future utilize interest rate swap contracts 
we have fixed rate debt from our senior notes  our senior subordinated notes and our convertible senior subordinated notes 
our floating rate exposure is related to our revolving credit facility and our securitization facilities  which are tied to changes in united states and european libor rates 
assuming a increase in interest rates  interest expense  net and the cost of our securitization facilities for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately million 
during  we had an interest rate swap contract outstanding to further minimize the effect of potential interest rate increases on floating rate debt 
this contract expired on december   and we had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding during the years ended december  and accounting changes on january   we adopted sfas no 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 the goodwill in each of our segments was tested for impairment as of january  as required by sfas no 
we utilized a combination of valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow approach  a market multiple approach and a comparable transaction approach 
based on this evaluation  we determined that goodwill associated with our argentine and north american reporting units was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax write down of goodwill of million 
this write down was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of million of taxes  in the first quarter of in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no

when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is 
table of contents accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset
