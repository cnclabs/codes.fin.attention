item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section of this annual report on form k titled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results  performance  or achievement  expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
we discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this annual report on form k and under the heading business and risk factors and certain factors affecting future operating results 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of anika therapeutics  inc and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
management overview anika therapeutics develops  manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products and devices intended to promote the protection and healing of bone  cartilage and soft tissue 
these products are based on hyaluronic acid ha  a naturally occurring  biocompatible polymer found throughout the body 
due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties  ha plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints  the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues  and the transport of molecules to and within cells 
our marketed products include therapies used in eye surgery and for the treatment of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis 
products in development include chemically modified  cross linked forms of ha to prevent surgical adhesions and for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta 
our products since we primarily focus on the development and marketing of our products  we have historically entered into various agreements for the distribution of our marketed products 
orthovisc  our product for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee in humans  has been marketed internationally since sales of orthovisc  which to date have been only to international customers  contributed approximately of our revenue in in december  we entered into the obi agreement with ortho biotech for the marketing of orthovisc in the us and mexico 
in february we received marketing approval from the fda for orthovisc and in march launched orthovisc in the us we market hyvisc  our product for the treatment of joint dysfunction in horses associated with equine osteoarthritis  through an exclusive agreement with boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc sales of hyvisc contributed approximately of our revenue in our ophthalmic business includes ha viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
our ophthalmic products included coease  staarvisc ii and shellgel distributed by advanced medical optics  inc  staar surgical company  and cytosol ophthalmics  inc  respectively 
those three products contributed approximately of revenue in we also manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus  also ophthalmic products  for bausch lomb under an exclusive supply agreement 
these sales to bausch lomb contributed approximately to our revenue in product revenue by region opthalmic products us orthovisc turkey canada europe middle east hyvisc us our current pre clinical products include incert  a product for the prevention of post surgical adhesions  and a product for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta 
we plan to begin human clinical trials for both of these products in the second quarter of orthovisc us we received marketing approval from the fda for orthovisc in february orthovisc is indicated for the treatment of pain in osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non pharmacologic therapy and to simple analgesics  such as acetaminophen 
the current treatment options for osteoarthritis before joint replacement surgery include viscosupplementation  analgesics  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and steroid injections 
orthovisc  our viscosupplement  is injected into the knee joint in a series of three intra articular injections one week apart 
in may we filed a pre market approval pma application for orthovisc with the fda 
in november we received an approvable letter from the fda for orthovisc and in february we received marketing approval from the fda 
under the obi agreement  ortho biotech will perform sales  marketing and distribution functions for orthovisc in the us and mexico 
additionally  ortho biotech licensed the right to further develop and commercialize orthovisc as well as other new products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis based on our proprietary viscosupplementation technology 
in support of the license  the obi agreement provides that ortho biotech is required to fund post marketing clinical trials for new indications of orthovisc 
under the obi agreement  we will be the exclusive supplier of orthovisc to ortho biotech 
the obi agreement provides for additional performance and sales based milestone payments to us contingent upon planned manufacturing upgrades  insurance reimbursement approval  and achieving specified sales targets in addition to royalty and transfer fees 
the obi agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and it otherwise is renewable by ortho biotech for consecutive five year terms 
we received an initial payment of million in december upon entering into the agreement with ortho biotech and a milestone payment of million in february as a result of obtaining fda approval for orthovisc 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  these payments will be recognized ratably over the initial ten year term of the obi agreement beginning with the first quarter of the obi agreement also provides for additional performance based milestone payments to us contingent upon planned manufacturing upgrades and insurance reimbursement approval 
we expect to recognize these milestone payments  if achieved  ratably over the remaining term of the agreement 
sales based milestone payments to us provided for in the obi agreement are based on ortho biotech achieving specified annual sales levels 
on an on going and long term basis  the obi agreement also provides for us to receive royalty and transfer fees 
our unit transfer price to ortho biotech is determined based on a fixed percentage of ortho biotech s net sales per unit  subject to a minimum 
this transfer pricing is fixed each quarter based upon ortho biotech s net sales of orthovisc for the quarter ended two quarters prior 
as a result  we expect to experience fluctuating unit pricing of our sales of orthovisc to ortho biotech each quarter 
royalties are to be paid to us quarterly based upon a percentage of ortho biotech s yearly net sales 
our agreement with ortho biotech has provisions for maintaining certain inventory levels affecting raw materials and work in process 
as a result  we expect to reflect an increase in these inventory levels in as compared with we may also benefit from improved gross profit margins partially due to increased manufacturing volumes as a result of initial stocking orders by ortho biotech required for the launch of orthovisc in addition to the increased overall sales volume 
financial overview in  we achieved net income of  or 
per share  and revenue of million 
we increased sales in each of our product groups primarily due to the full year impact of new distribution agreements or through expanded relationships with existing customers 
sales of amvisc and amvisc plus to bausch lomb were relatively flat in compared to and contributed of total revenue in compared to in we expect sales of amvisc products to bausch lomb to be relatively level in compared to and for their percentage contribution to our total revenue to decline 
cost of product revenue our cost of product revenue includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  obsolescence charges  packaging and shipping costs 
our costs of product revenue may vary over time based on the mix of products sold 
over the past three years we have experienced a decrease in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to increased manufacturing efficiencies and product volume combined with cost cutting efforts 
we expect to see continued improvement in due to further manufacturing efficiencies and increased product volume 
research and development our research and development costs consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and fees paid to outside consultants and outside service providers 
our research and development costs decreased in primarily due to lower fees paid to outside service providers associated with our clinical trial for orthovisc 
we expect to incur costs associated with human clinical trials for our product candidates in and to increase personnel related expenses as we expand our research and development efforts 
as a result  we expect an increase in research and development costs in compared to selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative costs consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  human resources  information technology  and sales and marketing functions 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting  fees for consulting and outside services  and insurance costs 
strategy our strategy for is to continue to focus on our strengths and to build on our accomplishments 
our focus  therefore  is to build on our existing products and advance our preclinical programs 
the key strategy is to support a successful us launch for orthovisc which became available for sale in the us on march   drive our orthovisc brand domestically and internationally  advance our preclinical programs with a pivotal human clinical trial in the us for our cosmetic tissue augmentation cta product in development and a pilot human clinical trial in europe for incert  our product in development to prevent post surgical adhesion  and focus research and development resources on evaluating potential product applications  including possible collaborations with other parties 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
product revenue is recognized upon confirmation of regulatory compliance and shipment to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales or if the sales price is fixed or determinable we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well as our business practices 
under our agreement with bausch lomb  the price for units sold in a calendar year is dependent on total unit volume of sales of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
accordingly  unit prices for sales occurring in interim quarters are subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume for the year becomes known 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  the amount of revenue subject to the contracted price adjustment is recorded as deferred revenue until the annual unit volume becomes known and the sales price becomes fixed 
orthovisc has been sold through several distribution arrangements as well as outsource order processing arrangements logistic agents 
sales of product through third party logistics agents in certain markets are recognized as revenue upon shipment by the logistics agent to the customer 
we recognize non refundable upfront payments received as part of supply  distribution  and marketing arrangements  ratably over the terms of the arrangements to which the payments apply 
milestone payments received as part of supply  distribution  and marketing arrangements are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if it represents a separate unit of accounting as defined in eitf  the milestone payments are non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payments and recognize them as revenue over the remaining term of the contract as we complete its performance obligations 
in february  as part of the obi agreement  we received a milestone payment of million as a result of obtaining fda approval for orthovisc 
we evaluated the terms of the obi agreement and the circumstances under which the milestone was paid and determined that the milestone payment did not meet all of the conditions to be recognized upon achievement  therefore  we expect to defer the milestone payment of million and recognize it ratably over the initial ten year term of the obi agreement beginning with the first quarter of reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  inventory cycle time  regulatory requirements and significant changes in our cost structure 
if ultimate usage varies significantly from expected usage or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write down or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we generally produce finished goods based upon specific orders or in anticipation of specific orders 
as a result  we generally do not establish reserves against finished goods 
under certain circumstances we may purchase raw materials or manufacture work in process or finished goods inventory in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval for the use of the raw materials in our manufacturing process or sale of the finished goods inventory 
we evaluate the value of inventory on a quarterly basis and may  based on future changes in facts and circumstances  determine that a write down of inventory is required in future periods 
restatement of results on january   we announced a restatement of our previously reported results for the three and nine month periods ended september  the restatement involved revenue recognized for the sale in the third quarter of of certain units of hyvisc 
a new clean room at our facility that at the time did not have a required regulatory approval for the manufacture of hyvisc from the fda was used in the production of these units 
because the product was shipped in the absence of this regulatory approval  we determined  and our independent accountants concurred  that revenue from that sale should not have been recognized 
as a result of the restatement  revenue for the three and nine months ended september  was reduced by  and the net loss for those periods increased by  or per share 
total hyvisc inventory at september   was  which included  in hyvisc inventory from the restated transaction  and  in hyvisc inventory produced in the new clean room which was previously included in our pre restatement inventory 
included in our inventory at december  was  in hyvisc inventory produced in the new clean room 
in june  we received regulatory approval to use the new clean room for the manufacture of hyvisc 
in addition  we received regulatory approval for the re release of the hyvisc inventory manufactured using the new clean room prior to receipt of the regulatory approval 
the re release of the hyvisc inventory was subject to certain conditions  including testing of the material and maintenance of certain records  which conditions were met 
in june we began shipping the re released hyvisc inventory and as of december  none of the re released inventory remained in inventory 
we had previously obtained all required regulatory approvals for the use of the new clean room in the manufacture of our products designed for human use orthovisc at the time  not approved for sale in the us  amvisc  amvisc plus  staarvisc ii  shellgel  and coease

product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared with  for the year ended december  year ended december  ophthalmic products   orthovisc   hyvisc   ophthalmic products sales increased  or  to  compared with sales of  in the increase is primarily attributable to one new distributor added in the second quarter of which reflected a full year of sales in sales of amvisc to bausch and lomb for were relatively level with sales for under the terms of the b l agreement  the price for units sold in a calendar year is dependent on the total unit volume of sales of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
accordingly  unit prices for sales occurring in the nine months ended september  and were subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume became known 
in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy  the amount of revenue reasonably subject to the price adjustment is recorded as deferred revenue until the annual unit volume becomes known and the sales price becomes fixed 
during the fourth quarter of each year the actual annual unit volume  and therefore the final sales price  became known and determinable 
in the fourth quarter of and  product revenue included the recognition of  and  respectively  of revenue related to sales of amvisc to bausch lomb  which had been previously deferred during the first three quarters of the respective years 
our sales of orthovisc increased  or  to  in as compared with  in the increase was primarily due to increased sales to our turkey distributor partially offset by a net decrease in sales among our european distributors 
we expect sales of orthovisc to grow in compared to reflecting the fda marketing approval of orthovisc and the obi agreement partially offset by lower sales in turkey 
we expect to continue to experience volatility in our international sales of orthovisc including ongoing competitive factors as well as economic and reimbursement issues  and potential regional conflict and political uncertainties 
sales of hyvisc increased  or  to  for as compared with  for sales of hyvisc are made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which expires in may the increase in sales of hyvisc included distributor inventory replenishment for certain units shipped without regulatory approval in the third quarter of licensing revenue 
licensing revenue for the year ended december  increased  or  to  from  in the prior year 
licensing revenue includes up front and maintenance payments on certain supply agreements with purchasers of our ophthalmic products which are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the related agreement 
the increase relates to a full year impact from a new distribution agreement effective in licensing revenue in is expected to include partial amortization of each of the million received in connection with the signing of the obi agreement in december and the million milestone payment received in february as a result of the fda approval 
these amounts will be recognized in income ratably over the ten year term of the agreement  or approximately  per quarter  beginning in the first quarter of in addition  the obi agreement provides for additional payments to us contingent on achieving certain performance milestones which  if met  the related payment is expected to be recognized in income ratably over the remaining term  beginning in the period in which the milestones are met 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of revenue  compared with  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit is mainly due to a higher margin product mix combined with efficiency gains in our manufacturing process 
we may experience further improvement in our gross profit margins with further unit volume growth as we continue to reduce cycle times by introducing outsourced intermediates in our manufacturing process 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house research and development efforts for the development of new medical applications for our ha based technology  the management and cost of clinical trials  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the decrease in research and development expenses during is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated with the pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc which was substantially complete in the first quarter of during expenditures associated with our pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc decreased approximately  compared to expenditures 
in late may we completed compilation of the clinical data and submitted a pma application to the fda as a requirement for seeking us market approval 
our in house research and development efforts relate to incert  a product designed to prevent surgical adhesions and products for the cta market 
our ongoing focus will include second generation versions of our existing ophthalmic and osteoarthritis products  as well as other therapeutics applications of ha 
we intend to enter a pilot human clinical trial for incert in the second quarter of as well as a clinical trial for our product for cta in the second quarter of as a result of these ongoing efforts  we expect research and development expenses will increase in compared to selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to a decrease in outside services fees of  combined with a decrease in professional service fees of  compared with these decreases reflect lower consulting and selling expenses in addition to lower legal expenses partially offset by an increase in accounting fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to as a result of increased personnel related costs as well as expanded marketing efforts for orthovisc 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  in the decrease is attributable to lower average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates during interest income in is expected to increase as a result of higher average cash and investment balances primarily due to the million milestone payment received in february income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  in federal tax law changed to allow for a five year carryback period and a suspension of certain limitations on the use of alternative minimum tax losses 
we filed an income tax carryback claim to carry our tax loss back to prior tax years 
as a result of the carryback claim  in the first quarter of  we received a refund of approximately  of taxes paid in prior years 
the tax benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes in the amount of  recorded for federal alternative minimum tax and  for state taxes paid on investment income 
for federal and state income tax purposes  net operating loss carryforwards offset the taxable income which included the million received in december as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  which may be available to offset future taxable income 
as provided in section of the internal revenue code irc the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year may be restricted in the event of certain changes in ownership 
we expect to recognize the million milestone payment received in february as taxable income in the first quarter of as a result  we expect that we will be able to utilize the loss carryforwards  in  in their entirety to offset part of our taxable income 
as a result of our expected taxable income in  we will reevaluate the positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets and consider whether a release of the valuation allowance is appropriate

product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared with  recorded in the prior year 
year ended december  ophthalmic products   orthovisc   hyvisc   the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in ophthalmic products sales and sales of hyvisc and was partially offset by lower orthovisc sales 
ophthalmic product sales increased  or  compared with as a result of higher unit sales volume from existing customers  including a full year from customers added during  and a new customer added in the second quarter of  partially offset by lower unit prices under the b l agreement 
under the terms of the b l agreement  the price for units sold in a calendar year is dependent on the total unit volume of sales of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
accordingly  unit prices for sales occurring in the nine months ended september  and  were subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume became known 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  revenue is not recognized if the sale price is not fixed or determinable  and any amounts received in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue 
in the fourth quarter of and  product revenue included the recognition of  and  respectively  of revenue related to sales of amvisc to bausch lomb  which had been previously deferred during the first three quarters of the respective years 
during the fourth quarter of each year the actual annual unit volume became fixed or determinable 
our sales of hyvisc increased by  or  for as compared with sales of hyvisc were made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which we renewed in may for a term of four years 
our sales of orthovisc decreased  or  in as compared with primarily due to erosion in our market share in turkey and pricing pressures in spain and portugal as well as decreased sales in other parts of europe 
we expect to continue to experience volatility in our international sales of orthovisc including ongoing competitive factors as well as economic issues  and potential regional conflict and political uncertainties 
licensing revenue 
licensing revenue for the year ended december  increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  in the prior year 
licensing revenue includes up front and maintenance payments on certain supply agreements with purchasers of our ophthalmic products 
the increase relates to a full year impact from new distribution agreements effective in  combined with a new distribution agreement effective in we expect licensing revenue in to be consistent with results for gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of revenue  compared with  or of revenue  for the year ended december  gross profit for  as compared with same period last year  benefited from improved manufacturing cost performance as a result of cost cutting initiatives we implemented during the latter half of  which continued into  combined with increased sales volumes and our efforts over the past year to reduce work in process inventories 
work in process inventory was reduced from  at december  to  at december  we had suspended certain manufacturing efforts in through late in in an effort to reduce work in process inventory levels of ha as a result of learning of unfavorable results from a clinical trial of orthovisc which we announced on may  as a result of the suspended manufacturing activities  work in process inventory was reduced from  at december  to  at december  during periods of reduced manufacturing activity  certain fixed costs of manufacturing were not fully absorbed into the cost of product manufactured and sold 
rather  such costs were charged to expense and amounted to approximately million during the full year of benefits resulting from manufacturing efficiencies were partially offset by lower prices for our sales of ophthalmic products under the b l agreement effective april  and lower prices of orthovisc reflecting competitive market conditions 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house research and development efforts for the development of new medical applications for our ha based technology  the management of clinical trials  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the decrease in research and development expenses during is primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel related costs of  due to lower headcount partially offset by increased costs of  associated with the pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc 
we expect that research and development expenses for will decrease compared to primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with the clinical trials for orthovisc which we expect will conclude in the first half of  partially offset by an increase in research and development efforts associated with new medical applications for our ha based technology 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during is primarily due a decrease in professional service fees of  combined with the impact of separation costs of  related to management changes which were included in the results for these decreases were partially offset by increases in personnel related costs of  and royalty expenses of  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in compared to related to expanded marketing efforts for orthovisc 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in compared to as a result of lower professional service fees 
as a result  we expect our aggregate selling  general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same in compared to litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs for the year ended december  was litigation settlement costs for the year ended december  included a charge of  which is the portion of the million settlement amount we contributed and  in professional fees related to the putative class action suit 
see note of the financial statements included in item herein 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  in the prior year 
the decrease is attributable to lower average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates during interest income in is also expected to be adversely affected by lower market interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances 
income taxes 
income tax expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the tax provisions primarily represent state income taxes paid on investment income 
for federal income tax purposes  we have had net operating losses available to offset otherwise taxable income 
as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of  and  respectively  which may be available to offset future taxable income  if any 
as provided in section of the internal revenue code irc the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year may be restricted in the event of certain changes in ownership 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures 
we expect that our requirement for cash to fund these uses will increase as the scope of our operations expand 
historically we have funded our cash requirements from available cash and investments on hand 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  and million at december  we received an initial payment of million in december upon entering into the obi agreement and a milestone payment of million in february as a result of obtaining fda approval for orthovisc 
the obi agreement also provides for additional performance based milestone payments to us contingent upon planned manufacturing upgrades and insurance reimbursement approval 
on an on going and long term basis  the obi agreement also provides for us to receive royalty and transfer fees 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared with cash provided by operating activities of  and cash used in operating activities of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of  plus non cash expenses of  and an increase in deferred revenue of  offset by an increase in inventories of  and a decreases in customer deposit of  accounts payable of  and accrued expenses of  the increase in deferred revenue includes the million upfront payment received in december associated with the obi agreement 
the increase in inventories reflects an increase in raw materials of  primarily to meet manufacturing requirements for  including the launch of orthovisc in the us  and an increase in finished goods of  primarily due to customer product demand requirements early in the first quarter of the customer deposit of  is related to the payment received from a customer for a sale in the third quarter of of certain units of hyvisc which was applied to new shipments of product during the first quarter of in connection with our restatement of results for the three and nine month periods ended september   we determined that revenue from a certain third quarter sale should not have been recognized and as of december  recorded the payment related to the sale as a customer deposit to be applied against subsequent shipments to the customer 
see the section captioned restatement of results on january  discussed above 
cash provided by investing activities was   and  for  and  respectively 
net cash flows from investing activities for includes proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of  partially offset by an increase in restricted cash of  and in increase in property and equipment of  in connection with the issuance of an irrevocable letter of credit to one of our vendors we had deposited  with our bank to collateralize the letter of credit which amount is recorded in restricted cash 
these funds are restricted from our use during the term of the letter of credit which is set to expire in april we expect to make additional purchases in requiring the issuance of one or more irrevocable letters of credit which may require us to deposit cash as collateral with our bank 
the increase in property and equipment of  is primarily due to expenditures for manufacturing equipment and computers and software 
we expect to increase our capital expenditures in for upgrading and expanding our manufacturing and packaging equipment as well as our computer systems 
cash provided by financing activities of  reflects the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques except for operating leases as disclosed in the contractual obligations table below that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we have no material commitments for purchases of inventories or property and equipment 
we expect to incur additional investments in our operations through increased inventory levels and balances in accounts receivable for compared to in addition to capital expenditures in for manufacturing equipment to meet anticipated higher volume requirements and computers and software and furniture and fixtures associated with normal operations 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful launch and future sales of orthovisc under the obi agreement  milestone payments under to the obi agreement  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost of maintaining adequate manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
we expect to recognize the million milestone payment received in february from ortho biotech as taxable income in the first quarter of as a result  we expect that we will be able to utilize the loss carryforwards  in  in their entirety to offset part of our taxable income 
as a result of our expected taxable income in  we will reevaluate the positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets and consider whether a release of the valuation allowance is appropriate 
we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
however  we believe that based on our current strategy  our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash flows requirements through the end of and possibly beyond 
see the section captioned risk factors and certain other factors affecting future operating results history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing may be made available to us or may be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations of non cancelable operating leases and other commitments at december  amount thereafter  total  risk factors and certain factors affecting future operating results our business is subject to comprehensive and varied government regulation and  as a result  failure to obtain fda or other governmental approvals for our products may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
product development and approval within the fda framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant approval for our new products on a timely basis if at all  or that fda review will not involve delays that will adversely affect our ability to commercialize additional products or expand permitted uses of existing products  or that the regulatory framework will not change  or that additional regulation will not arise at any stage of our product development process which may adversely affect approval of or delay an application or require additional expenditures by us 
in the event our future products are regulated as human drugs or biologics  the fda s review process of such products typically would be substantially longer and more expensive than the review process to which they are currently subject as devices 
our ha products under development  including a product for the cosmetic tissue augmentation market  incert  a product designed to prevent surgical adhesions  and second generation versions of our existing ophthalmic and osteoarthritis products  have not obtained us or foreign regulatory approval for commercial marketing and sale 
we believe that these products will be regulated as class iii medical devices in the us and will require a pma prior to marketing 
we cannot assure you that we will begin or successfully complete clinical trials for these products  the clinical data will support the efficacy of these products  we will be able to successfully complete the fda or foreign regulatory approval process  or additional clinical trials will support a pma application and or fda approval or foreign regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all 
we also cannot assure you that any delay in receiving fda approvals will not adversely affect our competitive position 
furthermore  even if we do receive fda approval the approval may include significant limitations on the indications and other claims sought for use for which the products may be marketed  the approval may include other significant conditions of approval such as post market testing  tracking  or surveillance requirements  and meaningful sales may never be achieved 
once obtained  marketing approval can be withdrawn by the fda for a number of reasons  including  among others  the failure to comply with regulatory standards  or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
we may be required to make further filings with the fda under certain circumstances 
the fda s regulations require a pma supplement for certain changes if they affect the safety and effectiveness of an approved device  including  but not limited to  new indications for use  labeling changes  the use of a different facility to manufacture  process or package the device  and changes in performance or design specifications 
changes in manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacturing that may affect safety and effectiveness may be deemed approved after a day notice unless the fda requests a day supplement 
our failure to receive approval of a pma supplement regarding the use of a different manufacturing facility or any other change affecting the safety or effectiveness of an approved device on a timely basis  or at all  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of our products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
significant delay or cost in obtaining  or failure to obtain fda approval to market products  any fda limitations on the use of our products  or any withdrawal or suspension of approval or rescission of approval by the fda could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  all fda approved or cleared products manufactured by us must be manufactured in compliance with the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations and  for medical devices  the fda s quality system regulations qsr 
ongoing compliance with qsr and other applicable regulatory requirements is enforced through periodic inspection by state and federal agencies  including the fda 
the fda may inspect us and our facilities from time to time to determine whether we are in compliance with regulations relating to medical device and manufacturing companies  including regulations concerning manufacturing  testing  quality control and product labeling practices 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with current or future fda requirements applicable to the manufacture of products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation and we cannot assure you that the future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect us 
in addition  changes in the existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the fda to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are subject to other existing and future federal  state  local and foreign regulations 
international regulatory bodies often establish regulations governing product standards  packing requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and or maintain compliance required for conformit europ enne marking ce marking or other foreign regulatory approvals for any or all of our products or that we will be able to produce our products in a timely and profitable manner while complying with applicable requirements 
federal  state  local and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to change 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes might have on our business 
the process of obtaining approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated delays 
we cannot assure you that approvals or clearances of our products will be granted or that we will have the necessary funds to develop certain of our products 
any failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining such approvals or clearances  could adversely affect our ability to market our products 
we have historically incurred operating losses and we cannot make any assurances about our future profitability 
from our inception through december  and through we have incurred annual operating losses 
for the year ended december   we recorded net income of  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our ability to maintain profitability is uncertain 
the continued development of our products will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct research and preclinical and clinical development programs  and the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or distribution arrangements either by us or our partners 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop these products or new medical applications of our existing products or technology  or that if developed  the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained  or if obtained  that sales  marketing and distribution capabilities and arrangements will be established in order to permit us to maintain profitability 
substantial competition could materially affect our financial performance 
we compete with many companies  including  among others  large pharmaceutical companies and specialized medical products companies 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources  larger research and development staffs  more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations and more experience in the regulatory process than us 
we also compete with academic institutions  governmental agencies and other research organizations that may be involved in research  development and commercialization of products 
because a number of companies are developing or have developed ha products for similar applications and have received fda approval  the successful commercialization of a particular product will depend in part upon our ability to complete clinical studies and obtain fda marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors  or  if regulatory approval is not obtained prior to competitors  to identify markets for our products that may be sufficient to permit meaningful sales of our products 
for example  several of our competitors obtained fda and foreign regulatory approvals before us for marketing ha products with applications similar to that of orthovisc 
thus  the successful commercialization of orthovisc will depend in part on our ability to effectively market orthovisc against more established products with a longer sales history 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the past we have experienced volatility in our international sales of orthovisc including ongoing competitive factors as well as economic issues  and potential regional conflict and political uncertainties 
as a result  we are uncertain of the extent of our future sales in these markets 
we are uncertain regarding the success of our clinical trials 
several of our products will require clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy for us and international marketing approval by regulatory bodies  including the fda 
we plan to begin a pilot human clinical trial in europe for incert s and a pivotal clinical trial for our product for cta in the second quarter of there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete clinical trials of incert s or our cta product or that we will be able to successfully complete the fda approval process for either incert s or our cta product 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter additional problems that will cause us to delay  suspend or terminate the clinical trials 
in addition  we cannot make any assurance that such clinical trials  if completed  will ultimately demonstrate these products to be safe and efficacious 
we are dependent upon marketing and distribution partners and the failure to maintain strategic alliances on acceptable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will be dependent  in part  upon the efforts of our marketing partners and the terms and conditions of our relationships with such marketing partners 
we cannot assure you that such marketing partners will not seek to renegotiate their current agreements on terms less favorable to us 
under the terms of the b l agreement  effective january   we became bausch lomb s exclusive provider of amvisc and amvisc plus ophthalmic viscoelastic products  in the us and international markets 
the b l agreement expires december   and superceded an existing supply contract with bausch lomb that was set to expire december  the b l agreement is subject to early termination and or reversion to a non exclusive basis under certain circumstances 
the b l agreement lifts contractual restrictions on our ability to sell certain ophthalmic products to other companies  subject to our payment of royalties 
in exchange  we agreed to a reduction in unit selling prices retroactively effective to april  and the elimination of minimum unit purchase obligations by bausch lomb 
we have not achieved incremental sales of our ophthalmic products to bausch lomb and or other companies sufficient to offset the effects of the price reduction and royalties to bausch lomb and there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the future 
the reduction in unit prices resulted in a decrease in our revenue and gross profit from the sale of amvisc to bausch lomb 
we expect revenue from bausch lomb in to be relatively consistent with in addition  under certain circumstances  bausch lomb has the right to terminate the agreement  and or the agreement may revert to a non exclusive basis  in each case  we cannot make any assurances that such circumstances will not occur 
for the years ended december   and  sales of amvisc products to bausch lomb accounted for  and of product revenues  respectively 
although we intend to continue to seek new ophthalmic product customers  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining new customers or to achieve meaningful sales to such new customers 
we have entered into various agreements for the distribution of orthovisc internationally which are subject to termination under certain circumstances 
we are continuing to seek to establish long term distribution relationships in regions not covered by existing agreements  but can make no assurances that we will be successful in doing so 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or engage appropriate distribution or collaboration partners or effectively transition to any such partners 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain european or other reimbursement approvals or  if such approvals are obtained  they will be obtained on a timely basis or at a satisfactory level of reimbursement 
in december we entered into a ten year licensing and supply agreement with ortho biotech products  lp  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  to market orthovisc in the us and mexico 
under the obi agreement ortho biotech will perform sales  marketing and distribution functions 
additionally  ortho biotech licensed the right to further develop and commercialize orthovisc as well as new products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis 
we cannot assure you that ortho biotech will be able to market orthovisc effectively or to establish sales levels to the extent that us and ortho biotech believe are possible in the timeframes expected  or at all  nor can we assure you that we will be able to achieve the performance and sales based milestones provided in the obi agreement 
furthermore  we cannot predict whether the license granted to ortho biotech in the obi agreement to further develop and commercialize orthovisc as well as new products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis based on our proprietary viscosupplementation technology will result in any new products or indications for use 
we will need to obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners to bring new and existing products to market and to replace certain marketing partners 
the failure to establish strategic partnerships for the marketing and distribution of our products on acceptable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our future success depends upon market acceptance of our existing and future products 
our success will depend in part upon the acceptance of our existing and future products by the medical community  hospitals and physicians and other health care providers  and third party payers 
such acceptance may depend upon the extent to which the medical community perceives our products as safer  more effective or cost competitive than other similar products 
ultimately  for our new products to gain general market acceptance  it will also be necessary for us to develop marketing partners for the distribution of our products 
there can be no assurance that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance on a timely basis  or at all 
failure of some or all of our future products to achieve significant market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary  and conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  medical products and biotechnology firms  including ours  can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or  if any patents are issued  whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage  or will not be circumvented by others 
in the event a third party has also filed one or more patent applications for any of its inventions  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office pto to determine priority of invention  which could result in failure to obtain  or the loss of  patent protection for the inventions and the loss of any right to use the inventions 
even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us  such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us  and diversion of management s attention away from our operations 
filing and prosecution of patent applications  litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents  assertion of patent infringement claims against others and the defense of patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that in the event that any claims with respect to any of our patents  if issued  are challenged by one or more third parties  that any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable 
an adverse outcome in such litigation could cause us to lose exclusivity covered by the disputed rights 
if a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us  we could be forced to cease using the technologies or marketing the products covered by such rights  could be subject to significant liabilities to such third party  and could be required to license technologies from such third party 
furthermore  even if our patents are determined to be valid  enforceable  and broad in scope  there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology 
we have a policy of seeking patent protection for patentable aspects of our proprietary technology 
we intend to seek patent protection with respect to products and processes developed in the course of our activities when we believe such protection is in our best interest and when the cost of seeking such protection is not inordinate 
however  no assurance can be given that any patent application will be filed  that any filed applications will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will provide us with a competitive advantage or will not be successfully challenged by third parties 
the protections afforded by patents will depend upon their scope and validity  and others may be able to design around our patents 
other entities have filed patent applications for or have been issued patents concerning various aspects of ha related products or processes 
there can be no assurance that the products or processes developed by us will not infringe on the patent rights of others in the future 
any such infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in particular  we received notice from the pto in that a third party was attempting to provoke a patent interference with respect to one of our co owned patents covering the use of incert for post surgical adhesion prevention 
it is unclear whether an interference will be declared 
if an interference is declared it is not possible at this time to determine the merits of the interference or the effect  if any  the interference will have on our marketing of incert for this use 
no assurance can be given that we would be successful in any such interference proceeding 
if the third party interference were to be decided adversely to us  involved claims of our patent would be cancelled  our marketing of the incert product may be materially and adversely affected and the third party may enforce patent rights against us which could prohibit the sale and use of incert products  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know how for certain non patented aspects of our technology 
to protect such information  we require all employees  consultants and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements limiting the disclosure and use of such information 
there can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our trade secrets  proprietary know how  and our technological advances will not otherwise become known to others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  despite precautions taken by us  others have not and will not obtain access to our proprietary technology 
further  there can be no assurance that third parties will not independently develop substantially equivalent or better technology 
pursuant to the b l agreement  we have agreed to transfer to bausch lomb  upon expiration of the term of the b l agreement on december   or in connection with earlier termination in certain circumstances  our manufacturing process  know how and technical information  which relate to only amvisc products 
upon expiration of the b l agreement  there can be no assurance that bausch lomb will continue to use us to manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus 
if bausch lomb discontinues the use of us as a manufacturer after such time  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected 
our manufacturing processes involve inherent risks and disruption could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations are dependent upon the continued operation of our manufacturing facility in woburn  massachusetts 
the operation of biomedical manufacturing plants involves many risks  including the risks of breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the occurrence of natural and other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements of directives of government agencies  including the fda 
in addition  we rely on a single supplier for syringes and a small number of suppliers for a number of other materials required for the manufacturing and delivery of our ha products 
although we believe that alternative sources for many of these and other components and raw materials that we use in our manufacturing processes are available  any supply interruption could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
we may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period  or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
furthermore  our manufacturing processes and research and development efforts involve animals and products derived from animals 
we procure our animal derived raw materials from qualified vendors  control for contamination and have processes that effectively inactivate infectious agents  however  we cannot assure you that we can completely eliminate the risk of transmission of infectious agents and in the future regulatory authorities could impose restrictions on the use of animal derived raw materials that could impact our business 
the utilization of animals in research and development and product commercialization is subject to increasing focus by animal rights activists 
the activities of animal rights groups and other organizations that have protested animal based research and development programs or boycotted the products resulting from such programs could cause an interruption in our manufacturing processes and research and development efforts 
the occurrence of material operational problems  including but not limited to the events described above  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations during the period of such operational difficulties 
our financial performance depends on the continued growth and demand for our products and we may not be able to successfully manage the expansion of our operations our future success depends on substantial growth in product sales 
there can be no assurance that such growth can be achieved or  if achieved  can be sustained 
we expect sales of orthovisc to grow in as a result of fda approval and the entering into of the obi agreement with ortho biotech 
there can be no assurance that even if substantial growth in product sales and the demand for our products is achieved  we will be able to develop the necessary manufacturing capabilities  obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners  attract  retain and integrate the required key personnel  implement the financial  accounting and management systems needed to manage growing demand for our products 
our failure to successfully manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we engage in any acquisition as a part our growth strategy  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy may include the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce stockholders ownership  cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives 
in addition  acquisitions involve other risks  including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets with which we have limited experience or where experienced distribution alliances are not available 
our future profitability may depend in part upon our ability to develop further our resources to adapt to these new products or business areas and to identify and enter into satisfactory distribution networks 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future or consummate future acquisitions 
sales of our products are largely dependent upon third party reimbursement and our performance may be harmed by health care cost containment initiatives 
in the us and other markets  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase health care products  such as our products  generally rely on third party payers  including medicare  medicaid and other health insurance and managed care plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the health care product 
we depend upon the distributors for our products to secure reimbursement and reimbursement approvals 
reimbursement by third party payers may depend on a number of factors  including the payer s determination that the use of our products is clinically useful and cost effective  medically necessary and not experimental or investigational 
since reimbursement approval is required from each payer individually  seeking such approvals can be a time consuming and costly process which  in the future  could require us or our marketing partners to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer separately 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain the costs of health care products and services by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products and by refusing in some cases to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
in addition  congress and certain state legislatures have considered reforms that may affect current reimbursement practices  including controls on health care spending through limitations on the growth of medicare and medicaid spending 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement coverage will be available or adequate for any products or services developed by us 
outside the us  the success of our products is also dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement and health care payment systems 
lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement provided by governments and other third party payers for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may seek financing in the future  which could be difficult to obtain and which could dilute your ownership interest or the value of your shares 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december  and received an additional million milestone payment in february in connection with the obi agreement 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  however  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such product development efforts  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to manage our manufacturing capabilities and related costs  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to you and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
we could become subject to product liability claims  which  if successful  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the testing  marketing and sale of human health care products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability  and there can be no assurance that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us 
although we have not received any material product liability claims to date and have an insurance policy of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate to cover such claims should they arise  there can be no assurance that material claims will not arise in the future or that our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such insurance  or additional insurance  if required  will be available in the future or  if available  will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
any product liability claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon hiring and retaining qualified management and scientific personnel 
we are highly dependent on the members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on us 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  scientific  managerial and manufacturing personnel 
we face significant competition for such personnel from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining the personnel we require 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulation and any failure to comply with applicable laws could subject us to significant liabilities and harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of local  state and federal government regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic  or other hazardous substances used in the manufacture of our products 
any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of hazardous chemicals or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our future operating results may be harmed by economic  political and other risks relating to international sales 
during the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our product sales were to international distributors 
our representatives  agents and distributors who sell products in international markets are subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which they operate and in which our products are sold 
a number of risks are inherent in international sales and operations 
for example  the volume of international sales may be limited by the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political and or economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in managing international operations  import restrictions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
such changes in the volume of sales may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our stock price has been and may remain highly volatile  and we cannot assure you that market making in our common stock will continue 
the market price of shares of our common stock may be highly volatile 
factors such as announcements of new commercial products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  disclosure of results of clinical testing or regulatory proceedings  governmental regulation and approvals  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the health care industry generally or in the medical products industry specifically  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical products companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
no person is under any obligation to make a market in the common stock or to publish research reports on us  and any person making a market in the common stock or publishing research reports on us may discontinue market making or publishing such reports at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that an active public market in our common stock will be sustained 
our charter documents contain anti takeover provisions that may prevent or delay an acquisition of us 
certain provisions of our restated articles of organization and amended and restated by laws could have the effect of discouraging a third party from pursuing a non negotiated takeover of us and preventing certain changes in control 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  advance notice to the board of directors of stockholder proposals  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors and to call stockholder meetings  the provision that vacancies on the board of directors be filled by a majority of the remaining directors 
in addition  the board of directors adopted a shareholders rights plan in april we are also subject to chapter f of the massachusetts general laws which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a massachusetts corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these provisions could discourage a third party from pursuing a takeover of us at a price considered attractive by many stockholders  since such provisions could have the effect of preventing or delaying a potential acquirer from acquiring control of us and our board of directors 
our revenues are derived from a small number of customers  the loss of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers  most of whom resell our products to end users and most of whom are significantly larger companies than us 
for the year ended december   bausch lomb accounted for of product revenues and of our accounts receivable balance and three other customers  combined  accounted for of product revenues and of our accounts receivable balance 
while it is expected that our ability to market orthovisc in the us as a result of the receipt of fda approval in february  and our entering into the obi agreement  will reduce our dependence on bausch lomb for revenues we will still be dependent on a small number of large customers for the majority of our revenues 
our failure to generate as much revenue as expected from these customers or the failure of these customers to purchase our products would seriously harm our business 
in addition  if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us  significantly reduce or delay their orders  or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreement  such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
furthermore  we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage the customers may have given their relative size and importance to us in any future negotiations 
any termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
accordingly  unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base  our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues  harm our reputation in the industry  and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow  and  as a consequence  could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we  through our international distributors  distribute orthovisc in canada  turkey and certain countries in europe and the middle east 
due to unfavorable results of the us orthovisc pivotal clinical trial announced on may   marketing efforts in these countries have been negatively affected 
there can be no assurance that as a result receiving fda marketing approval for orthovisc in the us marketing efforts will improve or that international sales levels for orthovisc will improve  maintain historical levels or that sales will occur at all in these countries 
additional costs for complying with recent and proposed future changes in securities and exchange commission  nasdaq stock market and accounting rules could adversely affect our profits 
recent and proposed future changes in the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq rules  as well as changes in accounting rules  will cause us to incur additional costs including professional fees  as well as additional personnel costs  in order to keep informed of the changes and operate in a compliant manner 
in addition  we expect to incur additional general and administrative expense as we implement section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls 
these additional costs may be significant enough to cause our financial position and results of operation to be negatively impacted 
in addition  compliance with these new rules could also result in continued diversion of management s time and attention  which could prove to be disruptive to our normal business operations 
failure to comply with any of the new laws and regulations could adversely impact market perception of our company  which could make it difficult to access the capital markets or otherwise finance our operations in the future 
with new rules  including the sarbanes oxley act of  we may have difficulty in retaining or attracting directors for the board and various sub committees thereof or officers 
the recent and proposed changes in sec and nasdaq rules  including those resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of  may result in our being unable to attract and retain the necessary board directors and members of sub committees thereof or officers  to effectively provide for our management 
the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes  may deter qualified individuals from wanting to participate in these roles 
we may have difficulty obtaining adequate directors and officers insurance and the cost for coverage may significantly increase 
we may have difficulty in obtaining adequate directors and officers insurance to protect us and our directors and officers from claims made against them 
additionally  even if adequate coverage is available  the costs for such coverage may be significantly greater than current costs 
this additional cost may have a significant effect on our profits and as a consequence our results of operations may be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not utilize any derivative financial instruments  market risk sensitive instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of our investments consist of money market funds  commercial paper and municipal bonds that are carried on our books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations is specific to the extent that certain sales were effected through logistics agents in foreign currencies 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on sales through logistics agents was immaterial for the year ended december  currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
