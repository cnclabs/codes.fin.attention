general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the aerospace group is one of the world s leading designers and manufacturers of business jet aircraft and is a leader in the long range and ultra long range  large cabin business jet market 
the company s market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business aviation products by us and foreign businesses  the us and other governments and high net worth individuals 
business aviation was affected by the global economic slowdown in recent years 
during that time  the company pursued aggressive management initiatives to improve efficiency and introduced new products that expanded the markets served by its aircraft 
the company anticipates an improved environment as the global economy shows signs of recovery and the business jet aircraft market stabilizes 
the company will continue to implement improved business processes to take full advantage of these conditions 
the company s management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices  disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements 
the company has proven itself as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows  which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions and share repurchases 
consolidated overview results of operations the company s net sales were billion in  up percent over acquisitions in information systems and technology and combat systems and strong organic growth in the company s defense businesses contributed to the sales growth  offset in part by reduced sales of new aircraft in aerospace 
the overall organic growth in was percent  led by percent organic growth in information systems and technology 
growth from acquisitions in was percent 
in  net sales increased by percent over on strong volume in information systems and technology and combat systems  as well as contributions from acquired businesses 
about half of the sales growth in was organic 
net earnings grew more than percent from  to just over billion in this increase resulted from both organic growth and acquisitions in information systems and technology and combat systems  but was offset partially by decreased earnings in marine systems and aerospace 
the downward pressure on earnings from marine systems was driven by performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts 
aerospace earnings were lower because of reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures  particularly in the first half of the year  however  management is cautiously optimistic that the business aviation market has stabilized 
for  the company s net earnings were essentially flat compared with because of an after tax charge of  reported as discontinued operations  that was associated with the company s exit from its undersea fiber optic cable laying business 
the company generated significant cash flow from operating activities in through strong operating results and diligent management of working capital  including sharply reduced levels of pre owned aircraft inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared with billion in and the company used its cash to pay down debt  as reflected in an increase in net debt of only billion during the year  despite making acquisitions in excess of billion 
the company also used the funds to repurchase its common shares  pay dividends and fund capital expenditures 
in and  cash from operating activities approximated net income 
general and administrative g a expenses as a percentage of sales have remained consistent year over year at around percent 
g a was billion in  in and in income from non operating items was in compared with in  which included a gain from the sale of some assets of the space propulsion operation within combat systems 
in  expense results of operations bar charts general dynamics annual report 
table of contents from non operating items was net interest expense increased to in from in  the result of a higher average borrowing balance from the company s issuance of additional debt to fund acquisitions 
net interest expense was in the company s effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the tax rate was lower than in previous years because of a settlement of the to audit cycle with the internal revenue service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes 
these events resulted in non cash benefits totaling  favorably impacting the company s tax rate by percent 
as noted above  the company exited its undersea fiber optic cable laying business in the fourth quarter of because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog 
the results of this business operations are included as discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for all periods presented 
the company recognized an after tax gain of in upon the favorable resolution of certain liabilities related to this business 
in  the company recognized an after tax loss of  including an after tax charge of for ship lease obligations and the write down of assets to net realizable value 
in  the cable laying business operated at a break even level 
operating results from this business had been included in the information systems and technology group since backlog backlog bar chart the company s total backlog increased percent over to billion at year end this growth resulted from substantial new order activity in all business groups and acquisitions in information systems and technology and combat systems 
new orders received during totaled billion  including an billion submarine order in the marine systems group 
the company s funded backlog grew percent over to billion at the end of the company s defense businesses contributed billion to the year end total backlog  an increase of percent over this portion of the total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog increased to billion in and includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by congress and funded by the customer 
the unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 
the backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
the total potential value of these contracts was approximately billion as of december   up from billion at the end of  and may be realized over the next years 
the aerospace group s total backlog of billion remained steady in despite adverse economic conditions in the business jet market in late and the first half of the aerospace funded backlog was billion at the end of and includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
the unfunded backlog  which consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services  was billion at year end  up slightly from the resources group s backlog was as of year end  of which was funded 
review of operating segments information systems and technology results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the information systems and technology group experienced strong net sales and operating earnings growth in from substantial organic growth and the addition of several new businesses 
volume increased in across all of the group s operations  reflecting the growing importance of digital  network centric cisr and information sharing technologies in the defense and intelligence communities 
this growth included increases in sales activity in infrastructure and information technology support services  deliveries of ruggedized computing equipment and high speed encryption products  sales to intelligence agencies  and volume on communications systems such as the bowman program  a secure digital voice and data communications system for the united kingdom s armed forces 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the group s overall operating margin decreased slightly in as a result of lower margins in the businesses acquired during the year  and because earnings in included the favorable resolution of some commercial program exposures 
during  the company completed three acquisitions in the group creative technology incorporated in march  veridian corporation in august and digital system resources  inc  in september 
the company believes these acquisitions strengthen its product mix and service offerings and expand its customer base within the intelligence and defense agencies of the us government 
also during  the company combined two business units into a new business unit  general dynamics c systems 
the company believes the combination of these two operations will enhance its competitive position and enable it to more efficiently serve its customers 
the combined business unit provides systems integration capabilities in the areas of tactical networks  information assurance  command and control  space products and systems  and military radios 
for  the company expects continued strong revenue and earnings growth in the information systems and technology group  driven by the acquisitions  the group s expanding customer base and the continued fielding of growing programs  such as bowman and the coast guard s rescue search and rescue system 
the company anticipates a modest decrease in operating margins as it continues to integrate the newly acquired businesses and as new awards change the group s contract mix 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  net sales and operating earnings were up considerably over the increases resulted from organic growth in core government programs  such as the bowman program  and the acquisition of integrated information systems group iisg from motorola  inc  in september operating margins in were significantly higher than historical averages due to a shift in the group s product mix  including accelerated deliveries of encryption products  the acquisition of decision systems  the reduction of commercial program exposures discussed above  and the elimination of goodwill amortization upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
backlog backlog bar chart the information systems and technology group s backlog increased billion in to billion at year end  from both acquisitions and new order activity 
over percent of the group s backlog at year end was funded 
in contrast with the company s other defense businesses  information systems and technology s backlog consists of a large number of relatively small dollar value contracts and programs 
these include programs that support the us government s military transformation  homeland security initiatives and overseas programs that underscore the growing international market for the company s products and services 
the group s backlog does not include approximately billion of potential contract value awarded under idiq contracts 
a significant portion of this idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole source supplier over several years to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies 
management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems 
however  because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
in  the company received two significant awards that extend two of the group s longest running programs 
the army awarded the company the common hardware software iii chs contract to provide continually updated commercial and ruggedized computers  network hardware equipment  power subsystems  peripheral devices and commercial software to the army  marine corps  air force and other federal agencies worldwide 
this idiq contract  which has a potential value of billion over its year life  is a follow on to the company s chs contract  now entering its tenth year 
in addition  the air force selected the company for an idiq contract  called intelligence information  command and control equipment and enhancements ice  to support and maintain critical intelligence and command and control systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide 
the contract  which extends a program that general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the company has been operating for over years  has a four year base term with two three year options and a total potential value of billion 
the company won several other notable awards during the year  including contracts to develop and demonstrate several aspects of the army s future combat systems fcs program 
the fcs program  which is central to the army s transformation initiative  is a family of advanced  networked air and ground based systems 
the information systems and technology group was selected to provide the integrated computer system  sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services for fcs 
the combined value of these information systems and technology awards is in excess of over the next five years  with potential for follow on production activity

this program provides the individual soldier with personal electronics  communications  global navigation and other integrated equipment designed to increase awareness  lethality and survivability 
the army plans to fully integrate this system with the stryker brigade combat teams and the fcs program 
including options  the land warrior program has a potential value of approximately over the next seven years 
the army awarded the company a contract with a potential value of approximately over years to integrate a voice and data communications system  called the secure enroute communications package improved secomp i 
this system is designed to enable joint tactical forces to arrive at their deployment destinations fully briefed on the most current intelligence reports and plan updates available 
combat systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group s net sales and operating earnings increased significantly in primarily due to a series of acquisitions during the year that broadened the company s product base  opened new markets and further aligned the company with department of defense transformational initiatives 
the growth from acquisitions was augmented by steady organic growth in sales and operating earnings  including increased volume in the leopard tank production program in spain  growing contributions to the army s fcs program and strong performance in the company s munitions and armaments operations 
this growth was offset slightly by fewer abrams main battle tank upgrades  reduced deliveries of the pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicle in spain and the termination of the crusader program 
during  the company completed three acquisitions in the group general motors defense gm defense in march  intercontinental manufacturing company in september and steyr daimler puch spezialfahrzeug aktiengesellschaft company kg steyr in october 
the acquisition of gm defense included mowag  a combat vehicle operation based in switzerland 
with the addition of mowag and steyr to the company s existing combat vehicle presence in spain  the company created a new business unit called general dynamics european land combat systems  based in vienna  austria 
the company believes the consolidation of these businesses under common management positions the combat systems group to strengthen its market base  better serve its customers and more competitively pursue land combat systems opportunities around the world 
the company believes the combat systems group  with its broad and diverse base of product offerings and substantial backlog  is well positioned for solid growth in and beyond 
accordingly  management expects strong revenue and earnings growth for the group in with operating margins consistent with year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin for  organic growth was the primary driver of the significant increases in net sales and operating earnings in the combat systems group 
this growth was fueled by increased production on the first brigade of the stryker program  increased deliveries on the leopard program  higher volume on various munitions programs and additional development work on the expeditionary fighting vehicle efv  formerly the advanced amphibious assault vehicle 
the acquisition of advanced technical products  inc  in june also contributed to the net sales and operating earnings growth in general dynamics annual report

table of contents marine systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the marine systems group s net sales grew in from increases in volume across the group  including contracts for design and early stage production on the virginia class submarine  conversion of trident submarines ssgn and design and production of t ake combat logistics ships 
commercial shipbuilding  engineering and repair volume also rose during the year 
these increases were offset partially by lower volume on several mature production programs  including the seawolf class submarine program 
operating earnings and margins for the marine systems group declined in because of performance problems on two commercial shipbuilding contracts 
in the first quarter of the year  earnings were affected by problems first encountered in in the construction of two roll on roll off cargo ships for totem ocean trailer express  inc tote 
after the first quarter  there was no further erosion in this program 
the two tote ships under contract have been delivered to the customer 
in the latter part of the year  the group experienced problems during the construction of the first ship of a contract to produce four double hull oil tankers 
management evaluated the program s performance and the estimates to complete the four ships and recognized losses totaling approximately on the contract 
the first ship was in the water in the fourth quarter of and was approximately percent complete at year end 
although the company does not expect any additional charges associated with these ships  management will continue to monitor the program closely 
the first two ships are scheduled to be delivered in  the third in and the fourth in the company expects revenue growth in the marine systems group in as the group executes its substantial backlog 
based on this large backlog of steady  long term production programs and management s current belief that the group has turned the corner on its commercial shipbuilding problems  the company expects marine systems operating margins to improve steadily in other significant events expected in include the may expiration of a collective bargaining agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union at bath iron works  which represents approximately percent of its work force 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  marine systems net sales were flat and operating earnings were down slightly from new commercial ship design work and an increase in volume on the virginia class submarine program were offset by lower volume on mature production programs 
this shift in the group s contract mix  along with the problems on the tote program discussed above  caused earnings and operating margins to decrease in backlog backlog bar chart the marine systems group s backlog grew remarkably in as a result of several significant contract awards 
at the end of  the group s backlog reached an all time high of billion  a percent increase over the backlog consists of numerous long term submarine and ship construction programs  as well as repair and engineering contracts

aerospace results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s sales and earnings were  and  respectively  for  down from the previous year 
the group s performance was affected by a deterioration in the business aviation market during the second half of and the first half of the deterioration was driven primarily by lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and pre owned aircraft 
in particular  the oversupply of relatively new pre owned aircraft available for sale in the market put additional pricing pressure on both new and pre owned aircraft 
these conditions lowered sales and put downward pressure on margins 
in response  the company took a series of actions  including cost reductions  layoffs and process improvements to reduce costs and improve profitability on an ongoing basis 
the company expects to realize significant annual expense savings beginning in as a result of these actions 
market conditions appeared to improve during the second half of  and the company is cautiously optimistic that the outlook for the aerospace group is improving 
the group experienced quarter over quarter sales and earnings growth beginning in the second quarter of  and new aircraft manufacturing margins improved steadily throughout the year 
pre owned and new aircraft inventories at year end declined considerably from  and losses associated with pre owned aircraft activity were all but eliminated by the fourth quarter  resulting in fewer losses in pre owned aircraft for the full year than in 
orders for new aircraft increased each quarter during the year and reached record levels in the fourth quarter of market data also indicate that prices are stabilizing on both new and pre owned aircraft 
the company expects improved earnings and operating margins in the aerospace group on slightly higher deliveries in  assuming price stabilization  elimination of pre owned losses and the realization of cost reduction actions taken in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion net sales in were flat compared with  while operating earnings decreased from losses on pre owned aircraft sales  charges to write down pre owned aircraft inventory to fair market value  fewer deliveries of large aircraft and a shift in the mix of new aircraft deliveries to include lower margin mid size aircraft

the company ended the year with a cash balance of  total debt of billion and a debt to capital ratio of percent 
cash generation continues to be one of management s key areas of focus  and was a particularly strong year in this regard 
free cash flow from operations for the year totaled billion  compared with in and in management defines free cash flow from operations as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays the company s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions and paying dividends 
the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with the cash flow from operating activities  as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows year ended december cash flow from operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow from operations as discussed above  the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally  make strategic acquisitions and repurchase the company s shares in the open market

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other postretirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition government contracts 
the company accounts for sales and earnings under long term defense contracts and programs using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg  costs incurred or output eg  units delivered measures  as appropriate to the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
business aircraft 
the company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the faa in accordance with statement of position these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
the company records revenues at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents pre owned aircraft inventories 
in connection with orders for new aircraft  the company routinely offers customers trade in options 
under these options  if exercised  the company will accept trade in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value 
once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft  the company records pre owned aircraft at the lower of trade in value or estimated net realizable value 
the company treats any excess of the trade in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction 
the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate 
the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information 
these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors  including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
gross margins on sales of pre owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 
commitments and contingencies 
the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the judgment of both management and legal counsel 
when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters and the company s exposure is reasonably estimable  the company records a charge against earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of the company s government contracts are required to be recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of the company s estimated workers compensation  other insurance related assessments  retirement benefits and environmental expenses 
these costs become allocable to contracts when they are paid 
the company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time they are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business  including both existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
these efforts include numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under the company s contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
if the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of the company s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
pension plans 
the company makes assumptions about discount rates and long term rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
these estimates require the use of judgment  including consideration of both current and future market conditions 
the company consults with outside experts to determine the appropriate assumptions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension cost as determined under sfas could increase or decrease 
if the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by basis points  the company s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately in likewise  had the interest rate used to discount the company s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by basis points  the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased by approximately or decreased by approximately in the company s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company s government plans 
the company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as such  the company s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 
management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  in january the fasb revised fin in december to clarify certain provisions and amend the effective date 
fin provides guidance on the consolidation of certain entities 
the interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if the equity interest at risk is not sufficient to permit that entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or if the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics 
fin is effective december   for special purpose entities created before february   and is effective in the first quarter of for all other variable interest entities 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate and variable rate long term debt obligations  variable rate commercial paper and short term investments 
as of december   the company had no short term investments 
fixed rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable until maturity and are not actively traded by the company in the market 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company s fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market rates of interest applicable to the company s commercial paper balances and floating rate notes would not have a material effect on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   no interest rate swap agreements were in effect 
the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers and certain inter company transactions in foreign currencies 
the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments  receipts and inter company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of pretax and an incremental unrealized loss of million pretax 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
