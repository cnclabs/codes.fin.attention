critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our research and development collaborations  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize license and other up front fees over the estimated research and development term of the agreement 
if the agreement does not have a specified research and development term  we must apply judgment in determining the appropriate level of recognition 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue  representing the unamortized balance of the million initial fee received in connection with our collaboration with roche 
this initial fee is being amortized through the second half of  the estimated clinical development period  which remains unchanged from the time the original estimate was determined in the fourth quarter of any changes in our estimate will result in either an acceleration or further deferral of the related revenue recognition 
clinical trial accruals over the next year  the clinical trials of our epothilone and geldanamycin analog programs will significantly increase our research and development expenditures 
research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are established prior to the initiation of the related clinical trial  thus establishing the basis of our estimates 
however  these terms may be subject to amendment due to changes in the scope and length of the related clinical trial 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity and adjust our estimates accordingly 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
we recognized other stock based compensation for non employees of approximately  in  million in and  in in addition  assuming no changes  we expect to recognize other stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted to non employees of approximately  in   in   in   in and  in the measurement of stock based compensation to non employees 
table of contents is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying securities vest 
as such  changes to these future period measurements could be substantial should we experience significant changes in our stock price 
for example  a increase in our stock price would translate into a increase in the related estimated expenses above 
see notes and of our financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
our revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to approximately million in contract revenue recognized under our development and commercialization agreement with roche  of which million represented the ratable portion of a million initial fee that is being recognized through the second half of  the estimated clinical development period  and million in non recurring milestones 
the remaining amount consisted of reimbursement of research and development expenses  including clinical trials conducted by us and clinical trial materials purchased by roche from us 
total contract revenues under our collaboration agreement with johnson johnson pharmaceutical research and development  llc  or j jprd  were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in included in revenues was approximately  related to a non recurring milestone payment received in connection with this collaboration 
this collaboration expired in december and no additional revenues will be generated under this agreement 
further  if we do not maintain or extend our agreement with roche  our revenues will significantly decrease unless we enter into additional collaborations that provide substantial revenues 
in addition  we recognized approximately million in grant revenue in  compared to approximately million in this increase was primarily due to additional government grants awarded during the year 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the approximately million increase in as compared to was due in large part to an approximately million increase in outside services related to the advancement of kos into phase ii clinical trials  the related production of clinical material  and preclinical development of our epothilone and geldanamycin analogs 
approximately million of this increase was associated with higher licensing related expenses and the settlement of the litigation with sloan kettering representing the reimbursement of research expenses related to the epothilone analog program 
also contributing to the year to year increase was an approximately million increase in research and development salaries and other personnel related expenses due to internal growth  and an approximately million increase in allocated facilities and expansion costs 
these increases were partly offset by an approximately million decrease in stock based compensation 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  clinical trial related services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers  licensing related expenses  lab consumables and facility related expenses 
we allocate salary driven and space use driven overhead expenses to research and development and to general and administrative expenses based on salaries and space use by each respective area 
our research and development employees increased to in from in we expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially as kos and aag advance further into the clinic  and as we advance our research programs into later stages of development

the length of clinical development depends on the specific disease and patient population 
for drug candidates that are in preclinical development  the timing of an investigational new drug  or ind  filing varies significantly and is difficult to predict and therefore not reflected in the table above 
roche is responsible for the costs of the epothilone clinical trails currently  trials of kos conducted under our collaboration 
we are responsible at our cost to supply aag for clinical trials sponsored by nci under the cradas  and nci is responsible for the remainder of the costs of these trials through phase ii 
in addition  we may sponsor other clinical trials of geldanamycin analogs at our sole expense 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the increase in compared to was due to an approximately  increase in employee related expenses to support our expanding research and development activities  an approximately  increase in professional and outside services for corporate governance and sarbanes oxley related expenses and an approximately  increase in facility related allocations in connection with the expansion of our facilities 
these increases were partially offset by approximately  in lower stock based compensation that resulted from the reversal of deferred compensation expenses in connection with employee terminations 
the number of our general and administrative employees remained unchanged at at december  as compared to december  we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support the continued growth of our research and development efforts 
interest income 
interest income decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in this decrease was attributable to lower investment yields associated with a continued depressed interest rate environment and lower average investment balances during the year 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in this decrease resulted from the scheduled repayment of existing debt at higher average interest rates  partially offset by additional equipment debt financing at lower average interest rates in we expect our interest expense will increase in the future resulting from additional property and equipment related debt financings 
years ended december  and revenue 
our revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to approximately million in contract revenue recognized under our development and commercialization agreement with roche  of which  represented the ratable portion of the first of two million installments of an initial fee that is being recognized through the second half of  the estimated clinical development period 
in addition  we recognized approximately million in grant revenue in  compared to approximately million in total contract revenues under our collaboration agreement with j jprd were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in included in revenues was a non recurring  milestone payment received in connection with this collaboration 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase  partially offset by the decrease in stock based compensation in  was due in large part to our expanded research and development efforts  including three phase i clinical trials of kos  related licensing expenses and additional staffing in support of our continued investment in internally funded programs and technologies 
our research and development employees increased to in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in the decrease was due to lower stock based compensation expense in  compared to  partially offset by higher employee related expenses to support our expanding research and development activities 
our general and administrative employees increased to in from in interest income 
interest income decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in this decrease was attributable to lower average investment balances and lower investment yields associated with the declining interest rate environment 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately  in from approximately  in this increase resulted from additional debt financing of property and equipment during gain loss on the recovery or write down of investment 
at june   we determined that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in short term commercial paper of southern california edison  a utility company  had occurred 
accordingly  we recorded approximately  loss on the related write down in the carrying value of the investment 
in march  the security was fully repaid 
thus  we recorded a realized gain on the investment of approximately  for the year ended december  provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses in the years ended december   and and consequently did not pay federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research 
table of contents and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  the net operating losses and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through use of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization
