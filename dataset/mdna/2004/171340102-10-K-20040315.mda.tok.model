item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview the company develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products 
it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products  primarily under the arm hammer trademark  to consumers through supermarkets  drug stores and mass merchandisers  and to industrial customers and distributors 
in  consumer products represented approximately and specialty products of the company s net sales 
the company does approximately of its business in the united states 
armkel llc  an equally owned joint venture between the company and the private equity group kelso company  manufactures and markets well recognized branded personal care consumer products 
armkel s trojan brand occupies the number one position in the domestic condom market  and its nair brand occupies the number two position in the domestic depilatory and waxes market 
furthermore  armkel is the number two provider of home pregnancy and ovulation test kits to consumers in the united states 
these kits are marketed under the first response and answer brand names 
under the terms of its joint venture agreement with kelso  the company has a call option to acquire kelso s interest in armkel beginning in the fourth quarter of  at fair market value as defined in the joint venture agreement subject to a floor and a cap 
the call option remains in effect through the beginning of the fourth quarter of  at which time kelso may request the company to purchase its interest 
for further discussion surrounding the joint venture agreement see the armkel section of liquidity and capital resources contained herein 
the company s primary financial objective and key performance indicator is to achieve average annual earnings per share growth of to for the period to the company expects to achieve this objective through a combination of sales from newly created and existing products referred to as organic growth  margin improvement  acquisition benefits from the recently acquired oral care brands  lower financing costs and  potentially  the acquisition of the remaining interest in armkel 
with regard to sales objectives  the company plans to concentrate on a few high value initiatives plus the stabilization of the declining sales trend in the former unilever brands 
in  the company will also be reviewing and modifying its promotion strategy  using new systems tools which became operational late in while difficult to predict  the company currently expects high single digit sales growth for the year  including the acquired brands 
as to margins  the company s objective is to improve its combined gross margin by an average of at least a year  assuming no significant change in commodity prices 
the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets  in which cost efficiency  new product offerings and innovation are critical to success 
the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and characterized by high household penetration  particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents 
the consumer products industry  particularly the laundry detergent  personal care and deodorizing categories  is intensely competitive and is not expected to improve any time soon 
furthermore  because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers  the company faces pricing pressure from these customers  particularly the high volume retail store customers  who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
to protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share  the company has had to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products 
consequently  the need for on going cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or product line extensions remain the most viable path to generating organic top line growth given the mature nature of most product categories in north american markets 
through the recent acquisitions of usa detergents and carter wallace s consumer business in and the fourth quarter acquisition of unilever s oral care business  as well as additional purchasing  manufacturing and distribution efficiencies obtained through economies of scale achieved in  the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 
this has resulted in generating higher levels of free cash flow 
with regard to the acquisition of unilever s oral care business  which had experienced sales declines over the past few years  management believes the acquisition provides attractive opportunities for the following reasons brand equities although the oral care business has been in decline for several years  management believes the acquired brand equities remain strong  and the business can be revitalized through additional focus  new product development and marketing support 
all four products are well established brands with distinct market positions 
pepsodent and aim  a traditional toothpaste and gel respectively  are positioned as value brands  with particularly strong distribution in the mass and dollar channels of trade  which have experienced steady growth in recent years 
close up is marketed as a value to mid priced breath freshening toothpaste and mentadent is premium priced and marketed as a serious oral care product 
information available to management indicates that unilever reduced its marketing support for these brands following its decision to sell the oral care business 
management believes that a marketing effort directed at revitalizing these well known brands can slow the decline and eventually stabilize these brands over the next two or three years 
economies of scale management believes that integration of the manufacturing  sales  marketing and accounting functions of the oral care business with those of c d can increase efficiencies and margins relating to c d s oral care products 
the sales  marketing and accounting functions were integrated in january in addition  c d intends to shift the manufacture of the acquired toothpaste brands to its plant at lakewood  nj  which specializes in manufacturing personal care products 
manufacture of pepsodent  aim and close up in lakewood is expected to commence in march  and manufacture of mentadent in lakewood is expected to commence in august 
table of contents increased market share management believes that the acquisition of the oral care business strengthens its important oral care business by tripling unit sales and more than doubling its dollar sales to of the billion retail toothpaste market 
in particular  management believes this broader product line will strengthen the company s position with the retail trade 
while management has plans to stabilize declining sales volumes for the acquired brands and ultimately increase sales  there can be no assurance that this will occur  when it will occur and the extent to which the declining trend can be reversed 
in the specialty products business  competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines remained intense in specialty chemicals  particularly sodium bicarbonate  have been negatively impacted for several years through new technology developed by a number of nahcolite based sodium bicarbonate manufacturers  who have been operating at the lower end of the business and have been making an effort to enter the higher end 
to strengthen its competitive position  the company over the last couple of years completed the modernization of its green river facility to provide better availability of specialized grades  and increased production capacity at the old fort facility 
the company also has been increasing its r d spending on health care  food processing  and other high end applications for sodium bicarbonate  as well as alternative products to compete with the lower end of the market 
as a result  merchant performance sodium bicarbonate sales volume grew from with respect to the animal nutrition product line  the company faced significantly higher ingredient costs for its line of nutritional supplements under the megalac brand name  and weathered a poor us dairy economy  which had a severe impact on the purchasing ability and financial viability of dairymen 
consequently  animal nutrition sales were virtually flat and operating profit declined by million 
to meet these challenges  the specialty products business pursued an important business improvement initiative which was aimed at improving its longer term operational effectiveness and cost structure 
this week project completed in the later part of  is expected to deliver annualized benefits in excess of million  a rigorous stage gate process for new product development  a redesigned organization and a business management system based on key performance indicators 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include promotional and sales returns reserves the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities  and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons  and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting  cooperative advertising  incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements 
all such costs are netted against sales 
slotting costs are expensed when the related sale is recognized 
co op advertising costs are expensed when the customer places the advertisement for the company s products 
discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place 
costs associated with end aisle or other in store displays are recorded at the completion of the related sale 
the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves 
for example  the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements 
based on the total face value of coupons dropped over the past couple of years  a 
deviation in the actual rate of redemptions versus the rate accrued for in the financial statements could result in approximately a million difference in the reserve required 
with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns  we use experience based appropriations  customer and sales organization inputs  and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required 
if the company s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by  the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately million 
while we believe that our promotional and sales returns reserves are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
during  the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately million based on adjustments to previous estimates  and in the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately million 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions 
with respect to goodwill  impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit 
for trademarks and other intangible assets  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse  economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  acts by governments and courts  may signal that an asset has become impaired 

table of contents property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  and future volume  revenue and expense growth rates 
the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment  and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows 
when an impairment is indicated  the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken 
future outcomes may also differ 
if the company s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized  then the company s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
in the company recognized an impairment charge of million on manufacturing equipment 
in  the company recognized trademark  equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately million 
inventory valuation when appropriate  the company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the company identifies any slow moving  obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is indicated 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company s products  technological changes  and new product introductions 
the estimates as to the future demand used in the valuation of inventory are dependent on the ongoing success of its products 
in addition  the company s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the rationalization of the number of stock keeping units 
to minimize this risk  the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required 
adjustments to the inventory s net realizable value were million at december   and million at december  valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to our actuaries  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in applicable high quality  long term corporate bond indices 
based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the moody s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
based on the published rates as of december   the company used a discount rate of for both plans  a decline of basis points from the rate used in this had the effect of increasing the projected benefit obligation for pensions and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend based on a year average  the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans  the asset mix of the plans  and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
based on these factors  the company s expected long term rate of return as of december  is  a decline of basis points from the rate used at december  a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return would result in less than a 
million change in pension expense for on december  the accumulated benefit obligation related to our pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets such excess is referred to as an un funded accumulated benefit obligation 
this difference is attributed to an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that resulted from the decrease in the interest rate used to discount the projected benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from to  partially offset by the increase in the market value of the plan assets at december  as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of million included in benefit obligations  and recorded a charge  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million which decreased stockholders equity 
the charge to stockholders equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense 
based on the aforementioned assumptions  the income statement impact for is estimated to be approximately million charged to earnings 
on a cash basis  an estimated contribution of approximately million will be required in 
table of contents tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
the company s estimated value of tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the company believes these tax contingencies are reasonable 
results of operations the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 
the discussion of our segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending december    and  including the results of unconsolidated affiliates 
the segment discussion also presents certain product line fluctuations 
consolidated results compared to net sales net sales increased by million or 
to million  compared to million in the previous year 
the majority of this increase was due to the additional sales stemming from the fourth quarter acquisition of the former unilever oral care business 
other increases included the effects of foreign exchange of approximately million and the reversal of prior period promotion reserves of approximately million due to a change in estimate 
these increases were partially offset by the company s change in revenue recognition policy from fob shipping point to fob destination point  which reduced sales by approximately million in last year s sales included a similar change in promotion estimate of million  as well as the discontinuation of certain former usa detergents cleaners and former carter wallace pet care products of approximately million

this increase in gross margin represents a substantial improvement in the consumer product margin partially offset by a substantial reduction in specialty products 
the higher consumer products margin was due to the full year benefits of the carter wallace integration completed in  as well as additional purchasing  manufacturing and distribution efficiencies associated with economies of scale achieved in  partially offset by higher start up costs and promotion expenses associated with new product introductions 
the lower specialty products margin was primarily due to higher ingredient costs for the animal nutrition business 
marketing expenses increased million to million 
the increase was primarily associated with advertising expenses for personal care products  namely higher arm hammer dentifrice and arrid brands  as well as the marketing costs associated with the newly introduced cleaning product brillo scrub n toss  partially offset by a reduction in advertising expenses for other personal care products

this decreases was primarily a result of the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in associated with the acquired carter wallace products  and tradename impairment charges recorded in  partially offset by higher personnel related expenses 
other income and expenses the increase in equity in earnings of affiliates of million was almost entirely due to the company s pro rata share in the year over year increase in earnings from armkel llc 
armkel s earnings increase for the year was primarily a result of a litigation settlement in the second quarter  partially offset by an impairment of an asset held for sale for a net contribution to the company of approximately million 
this increase over the prior year also reflected a strong performance by international operations  partially offset by significantly weaker domestic results 
earnings in reflected the disproportionate recapture of million of allocated losses sustained in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the terms of the armkel joint venture agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the prior period increase was also impacted by the inventory step up charge in the first quarter of relating to armkel s opening inventory values 
the combined results of company s other equity investments  armand products and armakleen  were virtually unchanged 
investment earnings were lower as a result of lower interest rates on funds invested 
interest expense increased

this improvement reflected a significant improvement in laundry products gross margins of points due to the virtually full year benefits of the usa detergents acquisition and the prior year promotion liability adjustment of million  partially offset by a reduced gross margin of points on personal care resulting from higher promotional spending related to sales  and higher manufacturing costs associated with the cranbury production of arrid antiperspirant earlier in the year 
to a lesser extent  gross margin was further hampered by approximately million of equipment obsolescence charges related to process improvements at two plants  and downsizing and impairment charges at two other plants 
the start up costs of the madera  california animal nutrition facility also negatively impacted gross margin 
marketing expenses increased million to million 
this increase was mainly due to the acquired brands and higher spending in support of deodorizing products  partially offset by lower spending on existing personal care products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million 
higher personnel related expenses and transition expenses associated with acquired products  and a million impairment charge related to the tradename valuation of a recently acquired brand name  were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill and certain tradename amortization expense associated with the company s adoption of sfas no

furthermore  c d consumer net sales were also lower due to discontinuation of some former usa detergents cleaners and former carter wallace pet care products  which impacted the deodorizing and cleaning products line 
net sales of liquid laundry detergent were significantly higher and more than offset the continuing industry trend of declining powder laundry detergent sales as more and more consumers switch to the liquid form of the product in the laundry products line 
personal care products  aside from the unilever impact  were lower in part because of a reduction in gum sales and the discontinued breathcare line 

table of contents c d consumer income before taxes and minority interest increased million or to million mostly due to an million increase in gross profit with almost half of this increase coming from the acquired unilever brands 
the remainder of this gross profit improvement was the result of improved laundry product margins as well as lower manufacturing costs for arrid antiperspirant since its relocation to the lakewood plant from the former carter wallace cranbury plant

specialty products income before taxes and minority interest decreased by million to million for the year 
this is mainly a result of a million decrease in gross profit due to higher manufacturing costs in certain animal nutrition and specialty chemical products  particularly a palm oil derivative used in animal nutrition 
lower gross profit along with lower marketing expenses of million mostly in the animal nutrition products  combined with flat year over year selling  general and administrative expenses  and a 
million reduction in interest expense 
compared to specialty products net sales grew million or to million in from million in largely as a result of the acquisition of biovance technologies inc of approximately million at the beginning of specialty products income before taxes and minority interest declined by million reflecting a negative impact to gross profit stemming from the start up costs of the new madera  california animal nutrition facility  for the production of megalac rumen bypass fats and related higher value megalac products for the west coast dairy feed additives market 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs for megalac related products 
these gross profit decreases were mainly offset by a higher gross profit contribution from the addition of the biovance acquisition

million  higher selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million  and higher interest costs of million 
other equity affiliates compared to other equity affiliates net sales of armand products company and armakleen company increased by million to million  with the increase being almost equally split between the two companies

the new tranche b loans  which have essentially the same terms as the replaced loans  but with more favorable interest rate provisions at basis points over libor  repayable in approximately million quarterly installments through september and thereafter in substantial quarterly installments until september  when the loan is fully paid 
as a result of the refinancing  the company wrote off the balance of the deferred financing costs associated with the previous financing in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  the company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with an issuer of receivables backed commercial paper in order to refinance a portion  million  of its primary credit facility 
the transaction resulted in a reclassification of long term debt to short term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheet

holders may convert their debentures into shares of the company s common stock prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per each  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the initial conversion price represents a premium over the closing price of the company s common stock on august   which was per share 
a holder may convert the debentures into the company s common stock under the following circumstances the sale price of the company s common stock is more that of the conversion price the conversion price premium  the trading price of a debenture falls below a specified threshold  specified credit rating events with respect to the debentures occur  the company calls the debentures for redemption  or specified corporate transactions occur 
because of the inclusion of the restricted convertibility feature of the debentures  the company s diluted net income per common share calculation does not give effect to the dilution from the conversion of the debentures until the company s share price exceeds the conversion price premium or one of the other events described above occurs 
the issuance of debentures is reflected on the company s statement of cash flow opposite the captions of proceeds from long term borrowings and deferred financing costs 
adjusted ebitda is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the company s primary credit facility and management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the company s ability to service its indebtedness 
adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
financial covenants include a total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  which if not met  could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility  if not remedied within a certain period of time 
adjusted ebitda was approximately million for the full year the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda at december  per the loan agreement was approximately versus the agreement s maximum  and the interest coverage ratio was approximately versus the agreement s minimum of 
this credit facility is secured by a blanket lien on all of the company s assets

table of contents the company generally relies on operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings to meet its financing requirements 
our diverse product offerings  strong brand names and market positions have provided a stable base of cash flow 
our diverse product line is marketed through multiple distribution channels  reducing our dependence on any one category or type of customer 
similar to other basic consumer products  we believe that consumers purchase our products largely independent of economic cycles 
however  the company s ability to meet its financial obligations depends on successful financial and operating performance 
the company cannot guarantee that its business strategy will succeed or that it will achieve the anticipated financial results 
the company s financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
these factors include competitive conditions in the categories of the consumer products industry in which we compete  operating difficulties  operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience  passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that affects us adversely  delays in implementing any strategic projects  and current geo political events 
the company cannot give assurance that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that it will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all its obligations  including those noted above 
if the company is unable to pay its obligations  it will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring indebtedness or raising additional equity capital 
however  the company cannot give assurance that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate to satisfy its obligation 
the company has a total debt to capital ratio of approximately 
at december  the company had million of additional domestic borrowing capacity available through its revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures in are expected to be moderately lower than the level of the prior year 
management believes that operating cash flow  coupled with the company s access to credit markets  will be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash requirements for the coming year 
armkel the armkel venture was initially financed with million in equity contributions  of which approximately million was contributed by the company  and an additional million of debt 
armkel llc had outstanding long term debt of million  and cash less short term debt of million  for a net debt position of million at year end 
in addition  armkel had unused revolving credit bank lines of million 
any debt on armkel s balance sheet is without recourse to the company 
under the terms of its joint venture agreement with kelso  the company has a call option to acquire kelso s interest in armkel in three to five years after the closing  at fair market value as defined in the agreement subject to a floor and a cap 
if the company does not exercise its call option  then kelso may request the company to purchase its interest 
if the company elects not to purchase kelso s interest  then kelso s and the company s equity in the joint venture may be offered to a third party 
if such a sale should occur  depending on the proceeds received  the company may be required to make a payment to kelso up to an amount of approximately million 
kelso also may elect to have the company purchase its interest for million 
this amount is not payable until the eighth year from the formation of the venture 
finally  kelso may require the company to purchase its interest upon a change in control as defined in the joint venture agreement 
the venture s board has equal representation from both the company and kelso 
if the company were to exercise its call option  it would likely incur additional debt  however  that decision would be made only after a number of financing alternatives were considered

a group of three c d consumer customers accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in  including walmart  which accounted for approximately 
this group accounted for in as part of the usa detergents merger agreement  the company divested usa detergents non laundry business and other non core assets to former usa detergents executives under the new company name of usa metro  inc usam  subsequently renamed usa detergents usad 
the company has a concentration of risk with usad at december  in the form of trade accounts receivable and an amount due for leased space of approximately million  a equity interest in usad of million and a note receivable for other assets of million payments start with the beginning of this note has a carrying value of approximately million using an effective interest rate of 
should usad be unable to meet these obligations  the impact would have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated statement of income 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s primary domestic borrowing facility is made up of a million amended credit agreement of which million remained outstanding as of december   and million of a revolving credit agreement all of which was un drawn at december  the company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with the issuer of receivables backed commercial paper in order to refinance a portion of its primary borrowing facility 
the balance outstanding under this agreement was million at december  during the third quarter of  the company also refinanced million of its primary borrowing facility through the sale of million principal amount of fixed rate convertible senior debentures due on august  the weighted average interest rate on all these borrowings at december   excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees  was approximately including the effect of hedges 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on this debt  as required by the credit agreement 
the swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
as of december   the company entered into agreements for a notional amount of million  swapping debt with a one month libor rate for a fixed rate that averages 
as a result  the swap agreements eliminate the variability of interest expense for that portion of the company s debt 
on an annualized basis a drop of in interest rates would result in a 
million payment under the swap agreement in excess of what would have been paid based on the variable rate 
however  a increase in interest rates would result in a 
million increase in interest expense on the debt not hedged 
the company s domestic operations and its brazilian subsidiary have other short and long term debts that are floating rate obligations 
if the floating rate were to change by from the december  level  annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would be immaterial 
foreign currency the company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily us dollar british pound  us dollar canadian dollar and us dollar brazilian real 
the company  from time to time  enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales denominated in the canadian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen 
the terms of these contracts are for periods of under months 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflows from the sale of products to foreign customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company did not have any forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  and december  the company is also subject to translation exposure of the company s foreign subsidiary s financial statements 
a hypothetical change in the exchange rates for the us dollar to the canadian dollar  the british pound and the brazilian real from those at december  and  would result in an annual currency translation gain or loss of approximately 
million in and 
million in equity derivatives the company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in market price of shares in the company s deferred compensation plan 
these contracts  which consist of cash settled call options in the amount of  shares  hedge approximately of the shares related to the plan and are marked to market through earnings 
as a result  the company recognized income of approximately million in  and 
million in  which reduced the charge for deferred compensation 
related party transactions the company has achieved substantial synergies by combining certain of its operations with those of armkel  particularly in the areas of sales  manufacturing and distribution  and most service functions 
armkel has retained its core marketing  research development  and financial planning capabilities  and continues to manufacture condoms  but purchases virtually all the support services it requires for its us domestic business from the company under a management services agreement  which has a term of five years with possible renewal 
during  the company invoiced armkel million for administrative services  purchased million of deodorant anti perspirant inventory produced by armkel at its cost and sold million of arm hammer products that were sold in international markets 
the company has an open receivable from armkel at december  of approximately million that primarily related to administrative services 
as noted in the concentration of risk section of this exhibit  the company divested usa detergents non laundry business and other non core assets to former usa detergents executives concurrent with the merger agreement 
the company has a ownership interest in the newly formed company usad 
the company supplies usad with certain laundry and cleaning products it produces to meet the needs of the markets usad is in at cost plus a mark up 
in addition  the company leases manufacturing and office space to usad under a separate agreement 

table of contents during  the company sold million of laundry and cleaning products to usad 
furthermore  the company billed usad 
million and usad billed the company 
million for leased space 
for open amounts receivable at december   see concentration of risk section on page the company s only financial interest in armkel and usad is the company s direct equity investments in armkel and usad 
the company has no relationship with the other equity holders of armkel and usad  respectively 
for this reason  the company believes it has no incentive to negotiate with either armkel or usad in a manner that is not in the best interests of its stockholders generally

table of contents competitive environment many of our competitors are large companies  including the procter gamble company  unilever  inc  the clorox company  colgate palmolive company  and sc johnson son  inc  which have greater financial resources than the company 
these companies have the capacity to outspend the company in an attempt to gain market share 
because of the competitive environment facing retailers  the company faces pricing pressure from these customers  particularly the high volume retail store customers  who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
these concessions or terms could reduce the company s margins 
furthermore  if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers  the customers could increase product purchases from our competitors  which would harm the company s sales and profitability 
consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  such as laundry and household cleaning products  are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 
the company has entered the oral care and personal care and deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its arm hammer trademark and baking soda technology 
these are highly innovative markets  characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions  and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 
in the toothpaste category  after leading its category in growth several years ago  driven by the success of arm hammer advance white toothpaste  the company s share dropped in both and mainly as a result of competitive new products and aggressive spending by other manufacturers in the category 
in the personal care category  several new products and line extensions in oral care were expanded during the final quarter of  in particular arm hammer advance breath care  a line of oral deodorization products including mouthwash  mints and toothpaste 
this oral care line of products did not live up to our expectations in and particularly since key retailers started moving away from mints and therapeutic gums in the oral care aisle of the store 
because this trend cannot be halted or reversed  this particular line of products is being discontinued 
in  the company announced several new consumer product initiatives 
early in  the company launched arrid total soft solid antiperspirants targeted primarily to women  and broadened its arm hammer ultramax antiperspirant line by adding a gel primarily targeted at men 
to strengthen its toothpaste franchise  the company introduced arm hammer complete care  the first arm hammer all in one toothpaste 
in the laundry area  the company launched arm hammer fresh n soft liquid fabric softener as a companion product to the existing fabric softener dryer sheets 
these products all reached broad national distribution during the second quarter 
in addition  beginning in the second quarter  the company launched brillo scrub n toss  a disposable cleaning pad  and the company s first major extension to the brillo line 
these introductions usually involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch  and the eventual success of these new product and line extensions will not be known for some time 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the national distribution of arm hammer easy flush clumping cat litter  a major new addition to its cat litter line 
the company also repackaged its xtra liquid laundry detergent line in vibrant new bottle colors cued to the product s fragrance variants  and expanded distribution of this product line in the mass channel 
early in  the company launched arm hammer enamel care toothpaste  its most important oral care innovation in several years 
enamel care is based on proprietary formulation and packaging technology which combines the cleaning and whitening properties of baking soda with fluoride and patented liquid calcium in a dual chamber tube to fill tooth surfaces and restore enamel luster 
the product is available in two variants advanced cleaning and natural whitening 
in addition  the entire arm hammer toothpaste line has been re staged with new packaging graphics designed to return the brand to its original emphasis on therapeutic benefits 
other important personal care initiatives  early in  include additions to the arrid total and arm hammer ultramax antiperspirant lines 
in the specialty products business  competition within the two major product categories  sodium bicarbonate and potassium carbonate  remained intense in sodium bicarbonate sales have been negatively impacted for several years by nahcolite based sodium bicarbonate manufacturers 
as for potassium carbonate  the company expects imports of video glass and production from foreign suppliers to affect us demand in as it did in during the year  the company continued to pursue opportunities to build a specialized industrial cleaning business using our aqueous based technology 
in early  the company extended its alliance with safety kleen corp 
to build a specialty cleaning products business based on our technology and their sales and distribution organization 
the second year of this alliance was impacted by safety kleen s financial difficulties leading to a chapter filing in june of  and a major reorganization implemented during the second half of that year 
since then safety kleen corp 
has emerged from its bankruptcy in while this opportunity has demonstrated more stability in and continues to hold great promise  the outcome will not be known for some time
