the components of our cost of sales primarily include direct costs of food  non alcoholic beverages and alcoholic beverages 
these costs are generally variable and will fluctuate with changes in sales volume and sales mix 
components of restaurant operating expenses include operating payroll and fringe benefits  and occupancy  maintenance and utilities 
all but one of our locations are leased and provide for a minimum annual rent  with some leases calling for additional rent based on sales volume at the particular location in excess of specified minimum sales levels

preopening costs include labor costs  costs of hiring and training personnel and certain other costs relating to opening new restaurants 
the provision for asset impairment reflects the charges made for the write down of certain underperforming restaurant assets 
we periodically review our long lived assets that are held and used in our restaurant operations for indications of impairment

management  supervisory and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  rent and office supplies  as well as accounting services fees  are major items in this category 
in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for full months 
as of march   there were restaurants in the comparable restaurant base 
annualized average weekly sales are computed by dividing net sales during the period by the number of store operating weeks and multiplying the result by results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under the caption selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this form k

income from discontinued operations was  for the weeks ended december  due to income applicable to the restaurant closed on march  quarterly fluctuations  seasonality and inflation our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period and the results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods 
our operating results may also fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  seasonality  profitability of new restaurants  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors and weather conditions 
the timing of new restaurant openings may result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of the revenues and expenses associated with each new restaurant location 
we typically incur most preopening costs for a new restaurant within the two months immediately preceding  and the month of  the restaurant s opening 
in addition  the labor and operating costs for a newly opened restaurant during the first three to six months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
our growth  operating results and profitability will depend to a large degree on our ability to increase the number of our restaurants 
we expect seasonality to continue to be a factor in our results of operations 
historically  our revenues have been moderately higher in the first and fourth quarters due to weather conditions  major sporting events and the year end holidays 
our revenues in most of our restaurants have been lower during the summer months of each year  and we expect lower second and third quarter revenues to continue in the future 
in addition  for accounting purposes  the first  second and third quarters of each fiscal year consist of weeks and fourth quarter consists of or weeks 
as a result  some of the variations in our operating results may be attributable to the different lengths of the fiscal quarters 
these quarterly fluctuations may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations include food  liquor and labor costs 
significant numbers of our personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage which is currently per hour 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage will increase our labor costs 
as costs of food and labor have increased  we have historically been able to offset these increases through economies of scale and improved operating procedures 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins 
liquidity and capital resources as is customary in the restaurant industry  we operate with negative working capital 
negative working capital increased  to  as of december  from  as of december  this increase is attributable primarily to the cost of purchases of property and equipment and common stock in excess of working capital provided by operations and net proceeds from the line of credit 
cash decreased  to  as of december  from  as of december  we do not have significant receivables or inventory and receive trade credit based upon negotiated terms in purchasing food and supplies 
because funds available from cash sales are not needed immediately to pay for food and supplies  or to finance inventory  they may be considered as a source of financing for noncurrent capital expenditures 
on september  we entered into a loan agreement with intrust bank  na the line of credit which provides for a line of credit of  subject to certain limitations based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of the past fifty two weeks and the amount of capital lease obligations on personal property 
on october   this line of credit was amended to extend the original term of the agreement by three years 
all other terms of the agreement remained unchanged 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the line of credit requires monthly payments of interest only until november   at which time equal monthly installments of principal and interest are required as necessary to fully amortize the outstanding indebtedness plus future interest over a period of four years 
interest is accrued at below the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
proceeds from the line of credit are being used for restaurant development 
as of december   we had borrowed  under the line of credit 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash flows from operations were  for the weeks ended december  compared to  for the weeks ended december  purchases of property and equipment were  in the weeks ended december  compared to  in the weeks ended december  net proceeds from the revolving note payable to bank were  for the week period ending december  compared to net payments on the revolving note payable to bank of  for the weeks ending december  at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we intend to open twelve to fifteen new locations in fiscal year and twelve to fifteen in fiscal year at march   two restaurants had been opened in fiscal  five restaurants were under construction and an additional six contracts had been executed 
we are currently evaluating locations in markets familiar to our management team 
however  the number of locations actually opened and the timing thereof may vary depending upon our ability to locate suitable sites and negotiate favorable leases 
we expect to expend approximately to million to open new locations over the next twelve months 
we believe the funds available from the line of credit and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in our operating plans  the acceleration or modification of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses  stock repurchases  potential acquisitions or other events will not cause the us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated  prevent us from achieving the goals of our expansion strategy or prevent any newly opened locations from operating profitably 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a summary of our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  including debt  lease agreements and the administrative services agreement is presented below 
the long term debt payments represent principal payments only 
the company must also make monthly interest payments on the outstanding debt balance at a rate of below the prime rate as published in the wall street journal at december  
less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     operating leases      other commitments    totals      critical accounting policies and estimates we consider determination of impairment of long lived assets as a critical accounting policy because the determination as to whether the long lived assets of a restaurant are impaired  and  if impaired  the fair value of such assets  requires the use of judgment  particularly as it relates to projecting whether the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant over an extended period of time will equal or exceed the carrying value of such assets 
we use the best information available to make the determination  however  actual future cash flows for a restaurant may vary significantly from the cash flows projected in conjunction with the impairment assessment 
the potential impact on our financial statements of incorrect judgments regarding impairment of long lived assets is that a provision for impairment could be needlessly recorded if projected future cash flows for a restaurant are significantly underestimated or a provision for impairment could be deferred until later determined necessary in a future period if initial projected cash flows are overestimated
