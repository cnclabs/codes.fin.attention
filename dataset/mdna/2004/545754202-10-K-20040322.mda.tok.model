highlights of operating results the following is an overview of our operating results for the year ended december  a more detailed discussion of our operating results  comparing our operating results for the years ended december   and  is included below under the heading results of operations 
was a year of significant change for loudeye 
in the first quarter  we experienced changes in our senior management and altered our business strategy to focus more on digital media products and services  with less emphasis on enterprise communications and media restoration services 
by the end of  revenues from digital media products and services had not yet increased sufficiently to offset the decline in enterprise communication and media restoration services that resulted from this transition 
as a result  revenues decreased from million in to million in in addition to our change in business strategy  we continued to execute those cost reduction initiatives implemented in  and implemented a number of new cost reduction initiatives for these included  among other things  reductions in our work force and the termination and renegotiation of several operating leases 
these actions contributed to substantial decreases in expenses 
for example  cost of goods sold decreased from million in to million in and total operating expenses decreased from million in to million in we also recorded special charges related to corporate restructurings  facilities consolidations and the impairment of goodwill and tangible and intangible assets of million in and million in these initiatives are described in more detail below under the caption special charges and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that as a result of these actions and additional operational and management realignment actions taken in  gross margins and operating margins should improve for however  we may continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
as a result of the factors described above  our net loss decreased from million in to million in we also strengthened our capital resources by completing a private placement financing transaction in august that resulted in net proceeds of million 
in february  we completed an additional private placement financing transaction that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
we have recently shifted our strategic focus and marketing resources more toward our new tier application level services 
see business products and services application services  above  and the loudeye solution  below 
our business prospects must therefore be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties often encountered by early stage companies in the internet related products and services market 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties 

table of contents significant trends and developments in our industry the media industry is in the midst of a significant transition 
business models are changing to incorporate the migration of media content from analog to digital and from physical packaging and distribution to electronic distribution 
the changing business models reflect the increase in consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the introduction of new consumer electronics devices  such as personal mp players  and the incorporation of new technologies and features in traditional devices 
along with the new consumer electronics devices  media formats and technologies have evolved at a rapid pace  and standards have not been established by the industry or marketplace 
finally  the emergence of peer to peer services and illegitimate file sharing  combined with the increased consumer adoption of digital media  has contributed to significant declines in physical cd sales in the music sector 
as a result  content owners are beginning to embrace the legitimate digital distribution channel 
to date  these trends have impacted primarily the music sector of the media industry  but we anticipate that the video sector will experience many of the same trends in the future 
digital media distribution represents a significant challenge for companies that want to enter or stay competitive in the space 
problems to overcome include the following obtain rights from content owners  obtain access to digital masters of the content  supporting multiple competing digital media formats and codecs to meet the needs of competing media players  supporting multiple bit rates and quality levels for different internet connection speeds  supporting multiple content protection technologies  including digital rights management drm platforms  complex reporting and auditing requirements of content owners  and significant upfront investment to develop a comprehensive solution and continued investment to keep pace with technology changes and content additions 
the loudeye solution during  we provided our services via two primary business segments  digital media services and media restoration services 
in january  we sold substantially all of the assets of our media restoration services subsidiary  vidipax  inc to a company controlled by the general manager of that subsidiary 
while we will have ongoing rights to co market and resell media restoration services for two years after the sale  we anticipate media restoration services will represent a significantly smaller portion of our operations for and beyond 
digital media services 
our existing products and services  combined with those we are currently developing  represent and end to end solution for our customers 
we provide a full service business to business digital media solution that allows our customers to deploy  rapidly and cost effectively  their own privately branded digital media service 
our solution is the culmination of our significant investments in our systems and infrastructure 
some of the key features of our solution include web enabled architecture  archive of million music tracks in uncompressed  digital master format  highly scalable and reliable operations  support for multiple media players  digital media formats and codecs  support for multiple bit rates  and extensive  transferable content rights and experience working with major and independent record labels 

table of contents although our customers may choose any combination of services we offer  our management views our solutions in three tiers of service 
these tiers are summarized as follows tier these services consist primarily of content management  encoding and fulfillment  and metadata services 
revenues from these services tend to consist of repeat  rather than recurring  business 
tier services currently account for a substantial portion of our digital media services revenue 
however  over the next several years we expect the proportion of revenues from tier services to decline relative to revenues from tier and tier services 
sales of our tier digital media services are generally under nonrefundable time and materials or per unit contracts 
under these contracts  we recognize revenues as services are rendered and we have no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally is the date the finished media is shipped to the customer 
tier these services consist primarily of hosted media and delivery as well as rights administration and settlement 
revenues from these services tend to consist of recurring business and may include some scalable economics 
revenues for tier services may include monthly minimum fees  setup and license fees  professional services fees  ongoing maintenance fees and a share in our customers revenues 
we sell our music samples service in application service provider asp arrangements 
we are required to host the applications and the customer does not have the ability to have the application hosted by another entity without additional charge 
billings are generally made based upon volumes of data delivered or minutes of content streamed  and revenue is recognized as the services are delivered 
our enhanced enterprise communication services include highly scalable  live and on demand audio and video webcasting services  supported by proprietary applications such as synchronized streaming slide presentation capabilities 
revenue from live webcasts is recognized when the webcasts are delivered 
revenue from on demand webcasts is recognized over the period of time they are made available 
tier these services consist primarily of custom application development  asp services  commerce engine  analytics and full operational outsourcing 
revenues from tier services will consist of recurring business and may include setup and licensing fees  professional services fees  ongoing maintenance fees and a share in our customers revenues 
we expect to launch our first tier services in and expect that over the next several years tier services will account for the majority of our revenues 
during  our primary marketing focus will be on our tier turnkey  private labeled end to end digital delivery solutions  with comparatively less marketing emphasis on the tier and components of our solution  particularly enterprise webcasting 
media restoration services 
our media restoration services segment has performed services to restore and migrate legacy media archives to current media formats 
we recognized revenues as services were rendered and we had no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally was the date the finished media was shipped to the customer 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in january we sold substantially all of the assets of our media restoration services business pursuant to an agreement dated october  accordingly  the assets and certain liabilities of our media restoration services business have been classified as held for sale at december  and management changes and restructuring as described below under special charges  for the year ended december   we experienced significant changes in our management during the first quarter of fiscal in march  we announced our intention to restructure to reduce costs and to focus our efforts on digital media services where we anticipated the best customer growth and higher gross margins 
as part of this strategic restructuring  we announced a reduction in staff affecting approximately of our workforce 
this reduction in staff affected employees in all departments  but primarily located at our headquarters in seattle  washington

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to revenues 
revenues totaled million and million for and and consisted of the following in thousands increase decrease digital media services media restoration services total revenue revenue from our digital media services segment increased in to million from million in this increase is due primarily to an increase in the volume of encoding and other fulfillment and related services  as well as the licensing of media player applications  offset by a decrease in webcasting revenues 
our product mix has changed significantly over the course of  as we shifted marketing emphasis away from webcasting and more toward digital media services  primarily digital music solutions 
media restoration revenues totaled million in compared to million in this decrease was the result of decreased revenue from a significant customer  as well as decreased customer spending on discretionary projects due to current economic conditions 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in january we sold substantially all of the assets of our media restoration services business pursuant to an agreement dated october  accordingly  media restoration services will not be a material portion of our operations in future periods 
at closing  we also entered into a co marketing and reseller agreement with the purchaser pursuant to which we will sell  for a fee  media restoration services on behalf of the purchaser for a two year period 
the co marketing and reseller agreement and earn out provisions of the transaction constitute continuing involvement under fas consequently  our media restoration business has not been reported as a discontinued operation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased to million for from million for cost of revenues decreased from of revenue in to of revenue in  and consisted of the following in thousands increase decrease digital media services media restoration services total cost of revenues cost of revenues include the cost of production  including personnel  an allocated portion of facilities and equipment  and other supporting functions related to the delivery of our digital media and media restoration services 
depreciation included in cost of revenues decreased to approximately  in from million in this decrease is due primarily to impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of for certain assets of our digital media services and media restoration services segments 
these impairment charges decreased the cost basis of the assets  resulting in lower depreciation charges 
for  we expect that depreciation expense will increase compared to as we invest in upgrading and enhancing our digital media services infrastructure and technology 
for example  in the first quarter of we invested million to upgrade the storage and access systems for our digital music archive 
the remainder of the decrease in cost of revenues is due to cost reduction initiatives  primarily reductions in our work force  implemented in the second half of and the first quarter of we expect cost of revenues to increase moderately in compared to 
table of contents operating expenses 
our operating expenses were as follows for and in thousands increase decrease research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible and other assets stock based compensation special charges total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses totaled million and million in and this decrease is due to the reduction in the number of development personnel as a result of the corporate restructurings 
research and development expenses include labor and other related costs of the continued development support of our digital media 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
however  due to our operational restructurings and a sharper focus on opportunities which we believe will result in near term results  development headcount was reduced significantly in as compared to and  as a result  research and development expenses declined in as compared to in  we expect to increase investment in the development of future digital media service offerings  including hiring additional personnel in this area 
accordingly  we expect that research and development expenses for will be higher than sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million in and sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  product branding costs  advertising  trade show expenses  and cost of marketing collateral 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is due to the decreased personnel related to our reductions in force in the second half of and first quarter of we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase moderately in as we expand our sales force and marketing personnel to market and sell our new tier application level products and services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for this decrease was due to the decrease in personnel related to our reductions in force in the second half of and first quarter of  and related cost reduction initiatives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of rent  facilities and information technology charges  salaries  legal expenses  investor relations costs and other costs associated with being a public company 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will increase moderately as we increase our personnel and other resources to support our growth 
in addition  we will incur additional professional fees in order to comply with the new requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of intangible and other assets 
amortization of intangible and other assets totaled million and million for and  and includes amortization of identified intangible assets related to past acquisitions 
the decrease was due to the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  which resulted in lower amortization charges during of all of our intangible and other assets included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  will be fully amortized by the end of the second quarter of however  we expect to incur additional amortization expense in related to our acquisition of overpeer  inc as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation for totaled million  consisting of the amortization of deferred stock compensation of  stock based compensation expense of  related to stock options granted to a member of our board of directors for consulting services provided through september   variable stock compensation expense of  related to stock options that were 
table of contents repriced in  stock and options issued to former employees as severance and termination benefits of  and stock options issued to a consultant of  stock based compensation was a credit of  for the year ended december   consisting of the amortization of deferred stock compensation and the reversal of expense related to accelerated amortization for options that were cancelled 
special charges 
we have recorded special charges related to corporate restructurings  facilities consolidations and the impairment of assets in accordance with our long lived asset policy 
following is a summary of special charges for and in thousands goodwill impairment intangible and other asset impairments property and equipment impairments facilities related charges employee severance and termination benefits other restructuring charges in february  our chairman and chief executive officer  john t 
baker  resigned and we engaged regent pacific management corporation to provide management services 
on march   regent pacific resigned from the engagement and jeffrey m 
cavins was elected president and chief executive officer 
during and subsequent to regent pacific s engagement  we undertook a strategic and operational analysis of our business and product lines 
this analysis resulted in the development of a new strategic and operational plan  under which we restructured our business to focus on our core competencies in digital media services and on core strategic customers and markets for our enterprise communications services 
we developed a revised corporate forecast in connection with this plan 
the revised forecast also considered that we had learned that revenue from a significant customer in our media restoration services segment would be less than originally anticipated 
utilizing the revised forecast based on our revised strategy  we performed a reassessment of the carrying value of all of our assets  both tangible and intangible 
the revised forecast demonstrated that certain tangible and intangible assets and goodwill related to our media restoration services and enterprise communications services businesses were impaired  as the projected undiscounted discernible cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives 
the fair values of each of these assets were estimated using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method 
the estimated fair values of each of the assets were then compared to their carrying values to measure the impairments 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded impairment charges in the first quarter of for goodwill  intangible assets  and property and equipment related to our enterprise communication services and media restoration services businesses of million   and  respectively 
in addition to the impairments above  we recorded severance and termination benefits of  associated with a reduction in force announced in march of approximately of our consolidated staffing 
in addition  we recorded  of severance and termination benefits with respect to certain changes in senior management in the first quarter of we incurred costs of approximately  related to the termination or renegotiation of certain facilities leases in connection with our ongoing facilities consolidation 
the other restructuring charges of  represent fees and costs paid to regent pacific management corporation with respect to interim management services provided to us in connection with our management and operational restructuring 
as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to exit certain of our leased facilities 
the exit plan identified all significant actions to be taken  including the method of disposition  locations of those activities and the expected dates of completion 
under the provisions of eitf  we recorded the estimated lease termination costs in accrued special charges at december  current year activity for accruals established under eitf is summarized in the following paragraphs 

table of contents in april  we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of our unoccupied facility on fourth avenue  seattle  washington 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a lease termination fee of  as a result  all of our obligations under the lease were terminated effective april  in accordance with eitf  the lease termination fee was included in accrued special charges at december  we had been paying approximately  per month under this lease 
in may  we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of our unoccupied facility in ardsley  new york

under the provisions of fas  we recorded certain additional lease termination costs during the year ended december  these additional costs were related to certain leased facilities whereby we had ceased using the facilities and notified the landlords that we had released our rights under the lease agreements 
these additional costs were recognized and measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the facilities 
current year activity for accruals established under fas is summarized in the following paragraphs 
in march  we terminated a portion of a lease for approximately half the space we occupied for our principal operating facility on rainier avenue  seattle  washington 
rents were reduced from approximately  per month with a term expiring in november to rent for the remainder of the facility of approximately  per month through june with options  that we exercised  to extend the term through december at a base rent of  per month and pre paid utility expenses of  per quarter 
as consideration for the lease termination  we allowed the landlord to retain its security deposit in the amount of  and made cash payments of  in december  we signed a new lease with the landlord that expires in december monthly rental payments under the new lease are approximately  through march and then  thereafter  reflecting an increase in the square footage occupied beginning in april in october  we vacated and ceased using our former streampipe facility in washington  dc and migrated its operations to our facility on rainier avenue  seattle  washington 
at that time  the landlord was informed of our decision to no longer occupy the washington dc facility and release of our rights under the lease agreement 
the lease for the facility expires in march and  under the requirements of fas  the present value of future minimum rental payments  net of sublease rentals  of  were recorded in accrued special charges during the year ended december  we have accrued special charges related to our media restoration facility in new york  new york 
the lease agreement was originally entered into in december and we have never occupied the facility 
during  we informed the landlord of our decision to release our rights under the lease agreement and have been in ongoing discussions with the landlord to negotiate a lease termination agreement 
accordingly  under the requirements of fas  we had accrued  in accrued special charges through the third quarter of representing the estimated fair value of future rental payments  net of sublease rentals and related costs with respect to the termination of this lease 
in december  we accrued an additional  for a total accrual of  to adjust our estimate of the fair value of the liability based on further negotiations with the landlord 
in february  we entered into a lease settlement agreement with the landlord 
the amount of the settlement was included in accrued special charges at december  for certain of the lease terminations described above  the settlement amounts were less than we had accrued initially due to favorable negotiations with landlords and improvements in real estate markets 
in other cases  we increased our accruals as a result of our ongoing evaluations of our lease obligations 
the adjustments resulting from these settlements and additional accruals were recorded in special charges in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we will continue to review the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairments 
future adverse developments in our business could result in additional impairments 
the following table reflects the activity in accrued special charges for the year ended december  in thousands 
we believe that all of these accrued charges  which represent primarily future rent obligations  will ultimately be paid in cash

interest expense totaled  and  in and the decrease was due primarily to lower average debt balances in due to the voluntary repayment of our credit facility in the third quarter of and lower interest rates in we anticipate that interest expense will increase slightly in due to higher average debt balances resulting from borrowings under the million term loan facility that we put in place at the end of increase in fair value of common stock warrants

in the first quarter of  we will spend approximately million on such equipment pursuant to a purchase commitment executed in december cash provided by financing activities was million for and consisted primarily of net proceeds from a private equity placement financing transaction of million in august  net borrowings under our line of credit and term loan facilities of million  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of million  offset partially by repurchases of stock of  cash used in financing activities was million in and resulted primarily from the decision to prepay our primary long term credit facility in the third quarter of  as well as payments on our capital lease obligations and repurchases of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million for and consisted primarily from borrowings under our credit facility of million  offset by principal payments on our long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
in addition  we repurchased million shares from our founder for million and also made a collateralized loan of million to him in in december we entered into a term loan with a bank under which we borrowed million 
the term loan also provides for up to  to collateralize standby letters of credit 
borrowings under the term loan are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and bear interest at the prime rate plus percent at december  
principal payments are due in equal monthly installments  plus interest  through january  in addition  the term loan restricts  among other things  our borrowings  dividend payments  stock repurchases  and sales or transfers of ownership or control  and contains certain other restrictive covenants that require us to maintain a certain quick ratio and tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we intend to use the proceeds to upgrade certain equipment related to our digital media services and technology infrastructure  repay certain capital lease obligations  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our term loan  line of credit and operating leases and capital leases 
we have other credit facilities and leasing arrangements that  in general  are not prepayable without penalty 
total principal amounts outstanding under the line of credit  capital lease obligations and term loan were million at december  these instruments bear interest ranging from approximately to and mature at various times through letters of credit of approximately  collateralize certain of the capital lease obligations and are collateralized by short term investments 
these short term investments have been classified as restricted investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table provides aggregated information about our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt line of credit capital lease obligations operating leases commitment to purchase equipment bandwidth and co location purchase obligations total contractual obligations capital lease obligations represent the total minimum future obligations inclusive of interest 
many of the contracts underlying these obligations contain renewal provisions  generally for a period of one year 
in addition  amounts payable under these contracts may vary based on the volume of data transferred 
the amounts in the table represent the base fee amount 
we also have contracts for bandwidth and co location services that run on a month to month basis and for which there is no unconditional obligation 
monthly amounts due under the month to month contracts are approximately  since inception  we have sustained substantial net losses to sustain our growth and establish our business 
beginning in  we commenced a variety of cost reduction initiatives to reduce costs 
for  we will continue to focus on managing costs and increasing sales 
we expect the following items may represent significant uses of capital resources in the foreseeable future we have commitments under leases for certain facilities which we no longer occupy 
one of these leases extends past scheduled payments under these leases for total million 
we are presently negotiating lease reduction or termination agreements that we believe will result in a substantial reduction to future obligations under certain of these leases 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in addition  we may have to make up front cash payments to terminate or reduce our obligations under these leases 
at december  accrued special charges includes amounts accrued for estimated rent obligations 
in december  we entered in to a commitment to purchase approximately million of equipment to upgrade our digital media services and technology infrastructure 
the equipment was delivered in january and we anticipate paying the million in the first quarter of we have certain commitments under existing arrangements with certain licensors of copyrighted materials that may require payments estimated to be approximately  in these amounts are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
we may enter into future transactions where we acquire complementary businesses 
such acquisitions may require the use of our capital resources 
in the first quarter of  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share to a limited number of accredited investors that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  including expansion of our business to business digital music solutions in the us and internationally 
we agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement for the resale of the securities sold in the private placement on 
table of contents or before march   and to use our reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the sec as soon thereafter as practicable 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements by considering accounting policies and estimates that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 and eitf we recognize revenue associated with the license of software in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  sop and related interpretations and technical practice aids 
we recognize revenues from encoding services  digital music samples services  internet radio services  live and on demand webcasting services  software licensing  and media restoration services 
we recognize these revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product and or service has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in arrangements that include rights to multiple products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement consideration among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on verifiable and objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
multiple element arrangements may consist of implementation services  development services  encoding services  digital music samples services  internet radio services  and live and on demand webcasting services 
verifiable objective evidence is based upon the price charged when an element is sold separately 
under the provisions of sop  in software arrangements that involve rights to multiple products and services  we allocate the total arrangement consideration among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements consist of software  intellectual property  implementation services  maintenance and consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not sold separately  the price established by management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
deferred revenue arises from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process 
deferred revenue expected to be realized within the next twelve months is classified as current liability 
long lived assets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
when doing so  management is required evaluate the recoverability of an asset s or group of assets carrying value through estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
if the assets are deemed impaired  the assets are written down to estimated fair value 
estimates of fair value may differ from the actual amount that could be realized if we were to sell our assets 
as described in note  we recorded impairment charges of million  million  and million in  and these amounts are included in special charges on the accompanying statements of operations 
management s assessments of the impairment of property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill are sensitive accounting estimates that could result in additional impairment charges in the near term 
factors that impact these estimates include  but are not limited to  possible changes in business plans  market price of our common stock and declining financial results 
net long term assets subject to impairment review in the future totaled million at december  we will continue to review the carrying value 
table of contents of our long lived assets and goodwill for impairments 
future adverse developments in our business will result in additional charges 
exit costs 
we have followed the provisions of eitf to record the costs associated with exit activities through december  and fas for exit activities after december  management is required to make its best estimates of exit costs such as remaining lease obligations and or termination fees  these estimates may be different than the actual amounts that will be paid under existing lease arrangements 
future adverse changes in our business could result in additional exit activities and charges 
litigation 
we become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our operations  including such matters as contract and lease disputes and complaints alleging employment discrimination 
we believe that the outcome of any such pending claims or proceedings individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect upon our business or financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
income tax valuation allowance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company s net deferred tax asset has been reduced by a full valuation allowance based upon management s determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met 

table of contents risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
our company has a short operating history and our industry is new and rapidly evolving  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we were formed as a limited liability company in august and incorporated in march our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate us or our prospects and performance  due to our unproven ability to generate profits  our limited historical financial data  and our limited experience in addressing emerging trends that may affect our business 
we have recently shifted our marketing emphasis to application level services  which we have only recently begun to deliver 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risk  expenses and difficulties we may encounter as an early stage company in the new and rapidly evolving market segments we serve 
as a result of such risks  expenses and difficulties  we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining broad market acceptance of our products and services and converting that acceptance into direct and indirect sources of revenue  establishing and maintaining our brand name  timely and successfully developing new products  product features and services and increasing the functionality and features of existing products and services  successfully responding to our current competition including  competition from emerging technologies and solutions  developing and maintaining strategic relationships to enhance the distribution  features  content and utility of our products and services  and attracting  training and retaining qualified sales  technical and customer support personnel 
our quarterly financial results will continue to fluctuate making it difficult to forecast our operating results 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including market acceptance of our turn key application level services  variability in demand for our digital media services and applications  market acceptance of our digital media and components offered by us and our competitors  ability of our customers and ourselves to procure necessary intellectual property rights for digital media content  willingness of our customers to enter into longer term volume or recurring revenue digital media and applications service agreements and purchase orders in light of the economic and legal uncertainties related to their business models  governmental regulations affecting use of the internet  including regulations concerning intellectual property rights and security measures  or competition from other companies entering our markets 

table of contents our limited operating history and unproven business model further contribute to the difficulty of making meaningful quarterly comparisons and forecasts 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based largely on our growth plans and estimates of expected future revenues 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term and our sales cycle can be lengthy 
thus  we may not be able to adjust spending or generate new revenue sources in a timely manner to compensate for any shortfall in revenues  and any significant shortfall in revenues relative to planned expenditures could have an immediate adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  our stock price could decline significantly 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to execute our business plan 
if we raise additional capital  current stockholders may experience significant dilution 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted investments 
in the first quarter of  we completed a private placement that resulted in net proceeds of million 
we have  however  experienced net losses from operations  and net losses are expected to continue into future periods 
if our existing cash reserves prove insufficient to fund operating and other expenses  we may find it necessary to secure additional financing  sell assets or reduce expenditures further 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to pursue our business objectives 
this inability could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced and these securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our current stockholders 
if we raise capital through debt financing  we may be forced to accept restrictions affecting our liquidity  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends 
because we expect to continue to incur net losses  we may not be able to implement our business strategy and the price of our stock may decline 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred net losses from inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses in future periods 
accordingly  our ability to operate our business and implement our business strategy may be hampered by negative cash flows in the future  and the value of our stock may decline as a result 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if  for example  we incur unforeseen capital expenditures  unforeseen operating expenses or make investments to maintain our competitive position 
if we lack necessary capital  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to be profitable in the future and we may not generate sufficient revenues to be profitable on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we might not be successful in implementing our business strategy in a cost effective manner  if at all  and the implementation may require significant additional expenditures on our part 
the capital requirements of our business strategy combined with the expectation that we will incur net losses in future periods could have a serious adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
even if we ultimately do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our success is dependent on the performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees who have worked together for only a relatively short period of time 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of one or several key employees could 
table of contents seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 
we must integrate our recent acquisition of overpeer  inc and we may need to make additional future acquisitions to remain competitive 
the process of identifying  acquiring and integrating future acquisitions may constrain valuable management resources  and our failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions may result in the loss of key employees and the dilution of stockholder value and have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we have completed a number of acquisitions during the past three fiscal years and we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future 
in march  we completed the acquisition of overpeer  inc integrating the overpeer acquisition and completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversions of management time and resources 
financing for future acquisitions may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate for any of our businesses  we may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully  finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or employees into our existing business and operations 
future acquisitions may not be well received by the investment community  which may cause our stock price to fall 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
if we acquire businesses  new products or technologies in the future  we may be required to amortize significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and we may record significant amounts of goodwill that will be subject to at least annual testing for impairment 
for example  we recorded in our first quarter of fiscal impairments of million   and  to goodwill  intangible assets  and property and equipment related to our enterprise communication services and media restoration services business 
a significant portion of those impairments related to assets acquired in our acquisition of tt holding corp 
in november if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership could be diluted significantly 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
if any of the negative events occur  our operations and financial position could be harmed 
we face competition from free peer to peer services such as kazaa and morpheus  from emerging paid online music services delivered electronically  and from traditional retail music distributors 
the online music services of our customers face significant competition from free peer to peer services  such as kazaa  morpheus  grokster and a variety of other similar services that allow computer users to connect with each other and to copy many types of program files  including music and other media  from one another s hard drives  all without securing licenses from content providers 
the legal status of these free services is uncertain  because although some courts have found that these services violate copyright laws  other services have been found to not violate any copyright laws  particularly in the case of grokster 
additionally  enforcement efforts against those in violation have not effectively shut down these services  and there can be no assurance that these services will ever be shut down 
the ongoing presence of these free services substantially impairs the marketability of legitimate services  regardless of the ultimate resolution of their legal status 
because digital recorded music formats  such as mp  do not always contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital recordings  users are able to download and distribute unauthorized or pirated copies of copyrighted recorded music over the internet 
this piracy is a significant concern to record companies and artists  and is a primary reason many record companies and artists are reluctant to digitally deliver their recorded music over the internet 
as long as pirated recordings are available  many consumers will choose free pirated recordings rather than paying for legitimate recordings 
accordingly  if this issue is not addressed  our business might be harmed 

table of contents many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than we do 
many of our competitors have significantly more resources than we do  including access to content  and some of our competitors may be able to leverage their experience in providing online music distribution services or similar services to their customers in other businesses 
some of these competitors may be able to offer services at a lower price than we can 
in addition  competing services may be able to obtain more or better music content or may be able to license such content on more favorable terms than we can  which could harm the ability of our online music services to compete effectively in the marketplace 
online music distribution services in general are new and rapidly evolving and may not prove to be viable business models 
online music distribution services are a relatively new business model for delivering digital media over the internet 
it is too early to predict whether consumers will accept in significant numbers online music services and accordingly whether the services will be financially viable 
if online music distribution services do not prove to be popular with consumers  or if these services cannot sustain any such popularity  our business and prospects would be harmed 
we must provide digital rights management solutions that are acceptable to both content providers and consumers 
we must also provide digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms in order to address concerns of content providers and artists  and we cannot be certain that we can develop  license or acquire such solutions  or that content licensors or consumers will accept them 
consumers may be unwilling to accept the use of digital rights management technologies that limit their use of content  especially with large amounts of free content readily available 
no assurance can be given that such solutions will be available to us upon reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to acquire these solutions on reasonable or any terms  or if customers are unwilling to accept these solutions  our business and prospects could be harmed 
our business could be harmed by a lack of availability of popular content 
our digital media services business is affected by the release of hit music titles  which can create cyclical trends in sales distinctive to the music industry 
it is not possible to determine the timing of these cycles or the future availability of hit titles 
hit products are important because they generate consumer interest 
we depend upon the music content providers to continue to produce hit products 
to the extent that new hits are not available  or not available at prices attractive to consumers  our sales and margins may be adversely affected 
the growth of our business depends on the increased use of the internet for communications  electronic commerce and advertising 
the growth of our business depends on the continued growth of the internet as a medium for media consumption  communications  electronic commerce and advertising 
our business will be harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow  particularly as a source of media information and entertainment and as a vehicle for commerce in goods and services 
our success also depends on the efforts of third parties to develop the infrastructure and complementary products and services necessary to maintain and expand the internet as a viable commercial medium  and identifying additional viable revenue models for digital media bases business 
we believe that other internet related issues  such as security  privacy  reliability  cost  speed  ease of use and access  quality of service  and necessary increases in bandwidth availability and access on an affordable basis  remain largely unresolved and may affect the amount and type of business that is conducted over the internet  and may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services and ultimately impact our business results and prospects 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by such growth  specifically the demands of delivering high quality media content 
as a result  the performance and reliability of the internet may decline 
in addition  websites have experienced interruptions 
table of contents in service as a result of outages  system attacks and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages  attacks or delays occur frequently or on a broad scale in the future  internet usage  as well as the usage of our products  services and websites  could grow more slowly or decline 
if broadband technologies do not become widely available or widely adopted  our online media distribution services may not achieve broad market acceptance  and our business may be harmed 
we believe that increased internet use and especially the increased use of media over the internet may depend on the availability of greater bandwidth or data transmission speeds also known as broadband transmission 
if broadband technologies do not become widely available or widely adopted  our online media distribution services may not achieve broad market acceptance and our business and prospects could be harmed 
congestion over the internet and data loss may interrupt audio and video streams  resulting in unsatisfying user experiences 
the success of digital media distribution over the internet depends on the continued rollout of broadband access to consumers on an affordable basis 
to date  we believe that broadband technologies have been adopted at a slower rate than expected  which we believe has delayed broader based adoption of the internet as a media internet distribution medium 
our business and prospects may be harmed if the rate of adoption does not increase 
more consumers are utilizing non pc devices to access digital content  and we may not be successful in developing versions of our products and services that will gain widespread adoption by users of such devices 
in the coming years  the number of individuals who access digital content through devices other than a personal computer  such as personal digital assistants  cellular telephones  television set top devices  game consoles and internet appliances  may increase dramatically 
manufacturers of these types of products are increasingly investing in media related applications  but these devices are in an early stage of development and business models are new and unproven 
if we are unable to offer our services on these alternative non pc devices  we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for digital media services or our costs may increase significantly 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a majority of our revenues so the loss of  or delay in payment from  one or a small number of customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and operating results 
a limited number of customers have accounted for a majority of our revenues and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
during and  one customer accounted for approximately and of our revenues and another customer accounted for and of our revenues 
we believe that a small number of customers may continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
due to high revenue concentration among a limited number of customers  the cancellation  reduction or delay of a large customer order or our failure to timely complete or deliver a project during a given quarter is likely to significantly reduce revenues 
in addition  if any significant customer fails to pay amounts it owes us  or does not pay those amounts on time  our revenues and operating results could suffer 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing and broadening our customer base  our business could be harmed 
average selling prices of our products and services may decrease  which may harm our gross margins 
the average selling prices of our products and services may be lower than expected as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments or otherwise 
the pricing of services sold to our customers depends on the duration of the agreement  the specific requirements of the order  purchase volumes  the sales and service support and other contractual agreements 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure and anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decrease over product life cycles 
we may not be successful in developing and introducing on a timely basis new products with enhanced features that can be sold at higher gross margins 

table of contents we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for music  software  and other content that we encode  distribute  or make available on to our customers 
we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for the content that we encode  distribute or make available to our customers if the content or the performance of our services violates third party copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  if our customers violate the intellectual property rights of others by providing content to us or by having us perform digital media services  or if content that we encode or otherwise handle for our customers is deemed obscene  indecent  or defamatory 
any alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs and diverting management s attention which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customers for encoding services generally agree to hold us harmless from claims arising from their failure to have the right to encode the content given to us for that purpose 
however  customers may contest this responsibility or not have sufficient resources to defend claims and we have limited insurance coverage for claims of this nature 
because we host  stream and webcast audio and video content on or from our web site and on other websites for customers and provide services related to digital media content  we face potential liability or alleged liability for negligence  infringement of copyright  patent  or trademark rights  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials we host 
claims of this nature have been brought  and sometimes successfully prosecuted  against content distributors 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage or any alleged liability could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to past  current  or future technologies 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of infringement claims 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
in addition  these risks are difficult to quantify in light of the continuously evolving nature of laws and regulations governing the internet 
any claim relating to proprietary rights  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  and we can not assure you that we will have adequate insurance coverage or that royalty or licensing agreements will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we do not continue to add customers for our services  our revenues and business will be harmed 
in order to achieve return on our investments in new products and services  we must continue to add new customers while minimizing the rate of loss of existing customers 
if our other marketing and promotional activities fail to add new customers at a rate significantly higher than our rate of loss  our business will suffer 
in addition  if the costs of such marketing and promotional activities increase in order to add new customers  our margins and operating results will suffer 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property  and we may be found to infringe on proprietary rights of others  which could harm our business 
our intellectual property is important to our business  and we seek to protect our intellectual property through copyrights  trademarks  patents  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions in our customer  supplier and strategic relationship agreements  nondisclosure agreements with third parties  and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors 
we cannot assure you that measures we take to protect our 
table of contents intellectual property will be successful or that third parties will not develop alternative solutions that do not infringe upon our intellectual property 
in addition  we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
potential customers may be deterred from distributing content over the internet for fear of infringement claims 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of heightened concern with respect to copyright infringement and other misappropriation claims  and the outcome of developing legal standards in that industry is expected to affect music  video and other content being distributed over the internet 
if  as a result  potential customers forego distributing traditional media content over the internet  demand for our digital media services and applications could be reduced which would harm our business 
the music industry in the us is generally regarded as extremely litigious in nature compared to other industries and we could become engaged in litigation with others in the music industry 
claims against us  and any resultant litigation  should they occur in regard to any of our digital media services and applications  could subject us to significant liability for damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
further  we plan to offer our digital media services and applications to customers worldwide including customers in foreign countries that may offer less protection for our intellectual property than the united states 
our failure to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property  or claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of third parties could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on strategic relationships to promote our services and for access to licensed technology  if we fail to maintain or enhance these relationships  our ability to serve our customers and develop new services and applications could be harmed 
our ability to provide our services to users of multiple technologies and platforms depends significantly on our ability to develop and maintain our strategic relationships with key streaming media technology companies and content providers 
we rely on these relationships for licensed technology and content 
we also rely on relationships with major recording labels for our music content licensing strategy 
obtaining comprehensive music content licenses is challenging  as doing so may require us to obtain copyright licenses with various third parties in the fragmented music recording and publishing industries 
these copyrights often address differing activities related to the delivery of digital media  including reproduction and performance  some of which may require separate licensing arrangements from various rights holders such as publishers  artists and record labels 
the effort to obtain the necessary rights by such third parties is often significant  and could disrupt  delay  or prevent us from executing our business plans 
because of the large number of potential parties from which we must obtain licenses  we may never be able to obtain a sufficient number of licenses to allow us to provide services that will meet our customers expectations 
due to the evolving nature of our industry  we will need to develop additional relationships to adapt to changing technologies and standards and to work with newly emerging companies with whom we do not have pre existing relationships 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing new relationships or that our partners will view these relationships as significant to their own business or that they will continue their commitment to us in the future 
if we are unable to maintain or enhance these relationships  we may have difficulty strengthening our technology development and increasing the adoption of our brand and services 
our business will suffer if we do not anticipate and meet specific customer requirements or respond to technological change 
the market for digital media services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements  some of which are unique or on a custom by custom basis 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments or requirements 
our future success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to offer services that incorporate leading technology  address the increasingly sophisticated  varied or individual needs of our current and prospective 
table of contents customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
you should be aware that our technology or systems may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies  we may not have sufficient resources to develop or acquire new technologies or to introduce new services capable of competing with future technologies or service offerings  and the price of our services is likely to decline as rapidly as the cost of any competitive alternatives 
the development of new or enhanced services through technology development activities is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of new services and enhancements 
in addition  our inability to effectively manage the transition from older services to newer services could cause disruptions to customer orders and harm our business and prospects 
our music content licenses could result in operational complexity that may divert resources or make our business more expensive to conduct 
the large number of licenses that we need to maintain in order to expand our music related services creates operational difficulties in connection with tracking the rights that we have acquired and the complex royalty structures under which we must pay 
in addition  our licensing agreements typically allow the third party to audit our royalty tracking and payment mechanisms to ensure that we are accurately reporting and paying the royalties owed 
if we are unable to accurately track the numerous parties that we must pay in connection with each delivery of digital music services and deliver the appropriate payment in a timely fashion  we may risk penalties up to and including termination of certain licenses 
competition may decrease our market share  revenues  and gross margins 
we face intense and increasing competition in the digital media services market 
if we do not compete effectively or if we experience reduced market share from increased competition  our business will be harmed 
in addition  the more successful we are in the emerging market for digital media services  the more competitors are likely to emerge 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include ability to offer a private branded solution service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  customer service and support  attracting third party web developers  and pricing 
many of our competitors have substantially more capital  longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive development of their technologies  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and establish more comprehensive marketing and advertising campaigns than we can 
our competitors may develop products and service offerings that we do not offer or that are more sophisticated or more cost effective than our own 
for these and other reasons  our competitors products and services may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our own  limiting our ability to gain market share and customer loyalty and to generate sufficient revenues to achieve a profitable level of operations 
our failure to adequately address any of the above factors could harm our business and operating results 

table of contents our industry is experiencing consolidation that may intensify competition 
the internet and digital media services industries are undergoing substantial change that has resulted in increasing consolidation and a proliferation of strategic transactions 
many companies in these industries have failed or are being acquired by larger entities 
as a result  we are increasingly competing with larger competitors which have substantially greater resources than we do 
we expect this consolidation and strategic partnering to continue 
acquisitions or strategic relationships could harm us in a number of ways 
for example competitors could acquire or enter into relationships with companies with which we have strategic relationships and discontinue our relationship  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our products and services or the loss of certain enhancements or value added features to our products and services  competitors could obtain exclusive access to desirable multimedia content and prevent that content from being available in certain formats  thus impairing our content selection and our ability to attract customers  suppliers of important or emerging technologies could be acquired by a competitor or other company which could prevent us from being able to utilize such technologies in our offerings  and disadvantage our offerings relative to those of competitors  a competitor could be acquired by a party with significant resources and experience that could increase the ability of the competitor to compete with our products and services  and other companies with related interests could combine to form new  formidable competition  which could preclude us from obtaining access to certain markets or content  or which could significantly change the market for our products and services 
any of these results could put us at a competitive disadvantage that could cause us to lose customers  revenue and market share 
they could also force us to expend greater resources to meet the competitive threat  which could also harm our operating results 
we must enhance our existing digital media services and applications  and develop and introduce new services and applications to remain competitive in that segment 
any failure to do so in a timely manner will cause our results of operations in that segment to suffer 
the market for digital media service solutions is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and short product life cycles 
these market characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the internet and the continuing trend of companies from many industries to offer internet based applications and services 
the widespread adoption of the new internet  networking  streaming media  or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our operating practices or infrastructure 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our digital media services and applications from those of our competitors  acquire and license leading technologies  bring digital media services and applications to market and scale our business and operations on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new services and applications or enhancements to existing services and applications that meet evolving industry standards and customer needs 
in the future  we may not be able to address effectively the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the technical innovations required for us to 
table of contents remain competitive are inherently complex  require long development schedules and are dependent in some cases on sole source suppliers 
we will be required to continue to invest in research and development in order to attempt to maintain and enhance our existing technologies and products  but we may not have the funds available to do so 
even if we have sufficient funds  these investments may not serve the needs of customers or be compatible with changing technological requirements or standards 
most development expenses must be incurred before the technical feasibility or commercial viability of new or enhanced services and applications can be ascertained 
revenue from future services and applications or enhancements to services and applications may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
the technology underlying our services and applications is complex and may contain unknown defects that could harm our reputation  result in product liability or decrease market acceptance of our services and applications 
the technology underlying our digital media services and applications is complex and includes software that is internally developed and software licensed from third parties 
these software products may contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we may not discover software defects that affect our current or new services and applications or enhancements until after they are sold 
furthermore  because our digital media services are designed to work in conjunction with various platforms and applications  we are susceptible to errors or defects in third party applications that can result in a lower quality product for our customers 
because our customers depend on us for digital media management  any interruptions could damage our reputation  cause our customers to initiate product liability suits against us  increase our product development resources  cause us to lose sales  and delay market acceptance of our digital media services and applications 
we do not possess product liability insurance  and our errors and omissions coverage is not likely to be sufficient to cover our complete liability exposure 
our network is subject to security and stability risks that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to litigation or liability 
online commerce and communications depend on the ability to transmit confidential information and licensed intellectual property securely over private and public networks 
any compromise of our ability to transmit such information and data securely or reliably  and any costs associated with preventing or eliminating such problems  could harm our business 
our systems and operations are susceptible to  and could be damaged or interrupted by a number of security and stability risks  including outages caused by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  internet breakdown  earthquake and similar events 
we do not have complete redundancy in our webcasting facilities and therefore any damage or destruction to these would significantly harm our webcasting business 
our systems are also subject to human error  security breaches  power losses  computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems  websites and network communications 
a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our websites could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and telecommunications systems that we deploy or use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
our operations also depend on receipt of timely feeds from our content providers  and any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of such feeds could disrupt our operations 
we also depend on web browsers  isps and online service providers to provide access over the internet to our product and service offerings 
many of these providers have experienced significant outages or interruptions in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
these types of interruptions could continue or increase in the future 

table of contents the occurrence of any of these or similar events could damage our business  hurt our ability to distribute products and services and collect revenue  threaten the proprietary or confidential nature of our technology  harm our reputation  and expose us to litigation or liability 
we may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches  hacker attacks or system malfunctions or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  attacks or failures 
our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments and therefore may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 
our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large complex networks 
our digital distribution activities are managed by sophisticated software and computer systems 
from time to time  we have needed to correct errors and defects 
in addition  we must continually develop and update these systems over time as our business and business needs grow and change  and these systems may not adequately reflect the current needs of our business 
we may encounter delays in developing these systems  and the systems may contain undetected errors and defects that could cause system failures 
any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of products or content or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing business services customers  users  advertisers or content providers 
if we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions  our products  services and websites could be less attractive to such entities or individuals and our business could be harmed 
our transmission capacity is not entirely in our control  as we rely in part on transmission capacity provided by third parties 
insufficient transmission capacity could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 
significant portions of our business are dependent on providing customers with efficient and reliable services to enable customers to broadcast content to large audiences on a live or on demand basis 
our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers 
any failure of such network providers to provide the capacity we require may result in a reduction in  or interruption of  service to our customers 
if we do not have access to third party transmission capacity  we could lose customers and if we are unable to obtain such capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us  our business and operating results could suffer 
our business and operations may be especially subject to the risks of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes our computer and communications infrastructure is located at a single leased facility in seattle  washington  an area that is at heightened risk of earthquake and volcanic events 
we do not have fully redundant systems  and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage 
despite our efforts  our network infrastructure and systems could be subject to service interruptions or damage and any resulting interruption of services could harm our business  operating results and reputation 
government regulation could adversely affect our business prospects 
few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the internet  other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses 
certain us export controls and import controls of other countries  including controls on the use of encryption technologies  may apply to our products 
many laws and regulations  however  are pending and may be adopted in the united states  individual states and local jurisdictions and other countries with respect to the internet 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including content issues such as obscenity  indecency and defamation  copyright and other intellectual property rights  digital rights management  encryption  caching of content by server products  personal privacy  taxation  e mail  sweepstakes  promotions  network and information security and the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications  including the future availability of broadband transmission capability and wireless networks 
these types of regulations are likely to differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions 
other countries and political organiza 
table of contents tions are likely to impose or favor more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
in addition  state and local governments may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our products and services  and may affect the growth of the internet 
such laws or regulations may harm our business 
our products and services may also become subject to investigation and regulation of foreign data protection and e commerce authorities  including those in the european union 
such activities could result in additional product and distribution costs for us in order to comply with such regulation 
there is uncertainty regarding how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  digital rights management  taxation  gambling  security  illegal or obscene content  retransmission of media  and personal privacy and data protection apply to the internet 
the vast majority of such laws was adopted before the advent of the internet and related technologies and does not address the unique issues associated with the internet and related technologies 
most of the laws that relate to the internet have not yet been interpreted 
in addition to potential legislation from local  state and federal governments  labor guild agreements and other laws and regulations that impose fees  royalties or unanticipated payments regarding the distribution of media over the internet may directly or indirectly affect our business 
while we and our customers may be directly affected by such agreements  we are not a party to such agreements and have little ability to influence the degree such agreements favor or disfavor internet distribution or our business models 
changes to or the interpretation of these laws and the entry into such industry agreements could limit the growth of the internet  create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our products and services  increase our cost of doing business  expose us to increased litigation risk  substantial defense costs and significant liabilities associated with content available on our websites or distributed or accessed through our products or services  with our provision of products and services  and with the features or performance of our products and websites  lead to increased product development costs or otherwise harm our business  or decrease the rate of growth of our user base and limit our ability to effectively communicate with and market to our user base 
the digital millennium copyright act dmca includes statutory licenses for the performance of sound recordings and for the making of recordings to facilitate transmissions 
under these statutory licenses  we and our broadcast customers may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings we deliver in original and archived programming and through retransmissions of radio broadcasts 
the dmca does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by arbitration proceedings  known as carp proceedings  supervised by the united states copyright office 
past carp proceedings have resulted in proposed rates for statutory webcasting that were significantly in excess of rates requested by webcasters 
carp proceedings relating to music subscription and non subscription services offering music programming that qualify for various licenses under us copyright law are pending 
we cannot predict the outcome of these carp proceedings and may elect instead to directly license music content for our subscription and or non subscription services  either alone or in concert with other affected companies 
such licenses may apply only to music performed in the united states  and the availability of corresponding licenses for international performances is unclear 
therefore  our ability to find rights holders and negotiate appropriate licenses is uncertain 
many of our customers may be affected by these rates  which may negatively affect our revenue 
several carp proceedings are pending for subscription music services and services that deliver digital downloads of music  and the outcome of these carps will also likely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict 
depending on the rates and terms adopted for the statutory licenses  our business could be harmed both by increasing our own cost of doing business  as well as by increasing the 
table of contents cost of doing business for our customers 
we anticipate future carps relating to music subscription delivery services  which may also adversely affect the online distribution of music 
the child online protection act and the child online privacy protection act impose civil and criminal penalties on persons distributing material harmful to minors over the internet to persons under the age of  or collecting personal information from children under the age of we do not knowingly distribute harmful materials to minors or collect personal information from children under the age of the manner in which these acts may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined  and future legislation similar to these acts could subject us to potential liability if we were deemed to be non compliant with such rules and regulations  which in turn could harm our business 
there are a large number of legislative proposals before the united states congress and various state legislatures regarding intellectual property  digital rights management  copy protection requirements  privacy  email marketing and security issues related to our business 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted  and certain proposals  if adopted  could materially and adversely affect our business through a decrease in user registration and revenue  and influence how and whether we can communicate with our customers 
we may be subject to market risk and legal liability in connection with the data collection capabilities of our products and services 
many of our products are interactive internet applications that by their very nature require communication between a client and server to operate 
to provide better consumer experiences and to operate effectively  our products send information to servers 
many of the services we provide also require that a user provide certain information to us 
we post an extensive privacy policy concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data involved in interactions between our client and server products 
any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy and existing or new legislation regarding privacy issues could impact the market for our products and services  subject us to litigation and harm our business 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us which may result in litigation that is costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business 
we  and various underwriters for our initial public offering are defendants in a putative shareholder class action 
the complaint alleges undisclosed improper underwriting practices concerning the allocation of shares for our ipo  in violation of the federal securities laws 
similar complaints have been filed concerning the ipos of more than companies  and the litigation has been coordinated in federal court for the southern district of new york as in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc a proposal has been made for the settlement and release of claims against the issuer defendants 
the settlement is subject to a number of conditions  including approval of other proposed settling parties and the court 
if the settlement does not occur  and litigation against us continues  we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the case vigorously 
in addition  because class action litigation has often been brought against companies with periods of volatility in their stock prices  we could become involved in additional litigation 
our stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  developments concerning our technologies and market offerings  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the digital media and internet markets  
table of contents announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  and other events or factors and general economic and market conditions 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies  and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
future sales of our common stock or the perception that future sales could occur  may adversely affect our common stock price 
if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the open market or if there is a perception that such sales could occur  the trading price of our common stock could decline materially 
in addition  the sale of these shares  or possibility of such sale  could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares of common stock 
the  shares subject to our recent prospectus represent of our common shares outstanding on december  in addition  in the first quarter of  we sold an additional  shares of common stock to a limited number of accredited investors and we have agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares sold in that financing 
the selling stockholders under the registration statements will be permitted to sell their registered shares in the open market from time to time without advance notice to us or to the market and without limitations on volume 
sales of shares pursuant to exercisable options and warrants could also lead to subsequent sales of the shares in the public market 
these sales  together with sales of shares by the selling stockholders  could depress the market price of our stock by creating an excess in supply of shares for sale 
availability of these shares for sale in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities 
securities analysts may not continue to cover our common stock or may issue negative reports  and this may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
there is no guarantee that securities analysts will continue to cover our common stock 
if securities analysts do not cover our common stock  the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business or us 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  recently adopted rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  and a global settlement reached between the sec  other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks in april  may lead to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms will now be required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
it may be difficult for companies with smaller market capitalizations  such as our company  to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock  which could have a negative effect on our market price 
if proposed accounting regulations that require companies to expense stock options are adopted  our earnings will decrease and our stock price may decline 
a number of publicly traded companies have recently announced that they will begin expensing stock option grants to employees 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has indicated that possible rule changes requiring expensing of stock options may be adopted in the near future 
currently  we include such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our annual financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but do not include stock option expense for employee options in our reported financial statements 
if accounting standards are changed to require us to expense stock options  our reported earnings will decrease significantly and our stock price could decline 

table of contents some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may deter takeover attempts  which may limit the opportunity of our stockholders to sell their shares at a favorable price 
some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at each annual meeting of stockholders  the terms of approximately one third of the directors will expire  and new directors will be elected to serve for three years 
it will take at least two annual meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors because a majority of the directors cannot be elected at a single meeting  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock may be issued in one or more series  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by the stockholders 
these terms may include voting rights including the right to vote as a series on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion rights  redemption rights and sinking fund provisions 
no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding and we have no present plans for the issuance of any preferred stock 
the issuance of any preferred stock  however  could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock  and therefore could reduce the value of our common stock 
in addition  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with  or sell assets to  a third party 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult  delay  discourage  prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change in control  thereby preserving the current stockholders control 
our bylaws contain provisions that require stockholders to act only at a duly called meeting and make it difficult for any person other than management to introduce business at a duly called meeting by requiring such other person to follow certain notice procedures 
finally  we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
the preceding provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management  even if such things would be in the best interests of our stockholders 
we have not  and currently do not anticipate  paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never paid any dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the stock market 
as substantially all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our risks 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on our invested cash balances of million at december   a one percent change in interest rates would cause a change in interest income of  per year 
due to the investment grade level of our investments  we anticipate no material market risk exposure 
in addition  our revolving credit facility and our term loan are based on the prime rate 
based on the million balance outstanding at december   a one percent increase in the prime rate would increase our interest expense by  per year 

table of contents we invest in investment grade government obligations  institutional money market funds and other obligations with fdic insured us banks 
concentration is limited to in any one instrument or issuer 
our primary investment focus is to preserve capital and earn a market rate of return on our investments 
we do not speculate nor invest in publicly traded equity securities and  therefore  do not believe that our capital is subject to significant market risk
