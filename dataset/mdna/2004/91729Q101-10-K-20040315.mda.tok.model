item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary was a challenging year for usf 
we experienced softness in the us economy  increases in our costs of labor and insurance  intense pricing pressure  and geographic expansion of our competitors 
despite these conditions  we earned  in income from continuing operations and generated a net increase in cash of  however  we recognized that within a changing  more competitive marketplace  our business model needed to be changed to remain competitive and grow the business 
under the direction of our leadership team  we will be focused in on becoming a company of one  projecting a common face to our customers so that in their dealings with any combination of companies within the usf system  the operations appear to be seamless 
the opportunity is to capitalize on the strength of the operating companies by availing ourselves of the synergies normally found in a company the size of usf corporation 
initiatives to be implemented in include the deployment of a best practices group aimed at increasing productivity across operating companies as well as providing for significant cost reductions 
placing a stronger focus on both corporate accounts and the cross selling of regional and inter regional products across all operating units 
a more rigorous budget process with heightened awareness of capital spending levels along with stronger profit and loss accountability across all operating units 
a new product  usf mexico sm  will increase cross border opportunities for the ltl  tl and logistics businesses and also provide usf with a significant competitive advantage over other transportation companies 
more focused it plans and structure that will be better aligned with strategic initiatives 
while we remain confident that usf will be a more focused and competitive company by the end of  there are risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the transportation and logistics markets that may impact our results 
examples include fuel costs  industry consolidation  regulatory issues  general economic weakness  weather  customer failures and others 
consolidated results our revenue and net income loss for through was as follows year revenue net income loss the following comments provide an understanding of significant items that were included in net income loss during each of the three years presented 
our net loss for included a goodwill impairment charge of  at usf worldwide  our discontinued freight forwarding segment 
the charge resulted from the adoption of sfas no 
our net income loss for and was negatively impacted by our losses from discontinued freight forwarding operations of and  respectively 
our net loss for included a loss of  related to the disposal of our freight forwarding segment 
the disposal of this segment was the result of taking the action necessary to better focus on our core competencies of providing high value comprehensive supply chain management services 

table of contents thousands of dollars  except share and per share amounts our net loss for included a charge of  related to the relinquishment of our interest in usf asia to better focus on our core competencies 
there were also loans of  that were forgiven in related to the relinquishment 
our net income for was negatively impacted by  due to a change in the accounting for revenue and expense recognition 
this change was made to recognize the increase in our average length of haul of freight  which resulted from our implementation of new marketing strategies 
our net income for included a gain of approximately  from the sale of our red star newark terminal 
our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the non core freight forwarding segment as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
results of operations ltl group our revenue  income from operations and operating ratios for through for our ltl group was as follows year total revenue income from operations operating ratio our ltl segment includes our ltl operating companies  each of which generates revenue from ltl and tl shipments 
revenue from ltl shipments represents approximately of the revenue in the ltl segment 
ltl statistics presented in the table below only include revenue from ltl shipments 
ltl statistics revenue revenue per per hundred weight per length revenue tons shipments shipment weight shipment of haul thousands thousands thousands pounds miles compared to in our ltl segment s total revenue and income from operations increased from by and  respectively 
the following provides an understanding of the factors that impacted our operating results ltl tonnage increased at reddaway resulting in a increase in ltl revenue 
revenue increased by at holland 
a difficult industrial economy for most of  particularly in the midwest  and increased competition impacted our ability to grow 
revenue at red star decreased by following our strategic decision to exit business with a large customer  and the closure of terminals in the carolinas and atlanta 
these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of a small northeastern carrier and its contribution of  to revenue in

revenue from fuel surcharges increased  due to rising fuel costs 
premierplus revenue increased as a result of our marketing and service efforts 
this revenue represented and of ltl revenue in and  respectively 
income from operations for included a gain of  from the sale of our red star newark terminal 
income from operations was also impacted by the effect of increased insurance costs of or  which reflects the continued escalation of insurance premiums and the medical cost driven inflation of workers compensation  and continued pricing pressures in the midwest and southwest  which affected holland and bestway 
we were able to increase our revenue per shipment and revenue per hundredweight through increased focus on yield in our pricing decisions 
holland  our largest subsidiary  accounted for of our ltl segment s total revenue and of its income from operations 
holland s total revenue and income from operations in were  and  an increase of  and a decrease of  respectively 
although holland s income from operations and margins decreased from  margins improved during the latter part of as result of increased focus on managing yield and costs 
also during  holland was negatively impacted by increased contractual benefit and workers compensation costs 
compared to the following provides an understanding of the factors that impacted our operating results revenue and income from operations were lower during the first eight months of compared to the first eight months of in early september  consolidated freightways cf filed for bankruptcy and our ltl segment captured a portion of cf s former revenue which contributed to our fourth quarter revenue increase of compared to the fourth quarter of in late june  our ltl segment enacted a general rate increase  the same as in june pricing pressures continued throughout the year  but rates held in the fourth quarter  as evidenced by the increase in our ltl revenue per hundredweight compared to the increase in our ltl segment s operating ratio was primarily attributed to an increase in labor  union health care  and equipment maintenance expense 
workers compensation and other insurance were generally flat in both years 
this cost control was achieved as the ltl segment managed increases in insurance premiums by increasing our level of self insured risks 
reductions in cargo claims in offset the increases in workers compensation and third party liability expenses 
at holland  our largest subsidiary  revenue increased to  in compared to  in  and income from operations declined to  in from  in even though holland showed increased business volumes tonnage and shipments grew by and  respectively  its average revenue per shipment decreased  resulting in a decrease in margins 

table of contents thousands of dollars  except share and per share amounts truckload year revenue income from operations operating ratio the following provides an understanding of the factors that impacted our operating results the increase in revenue in from was primarily due to the acquisition of system express  inc  a truckload carrier based in tennessee that contributed  increases in revenue per mile  increased business volumes with new customers and our regional ltl carriers performing the intercompany substitute line haul for our premierplus service product also contributed to the revenue increase 
the decline in the tl segment s income from operations was primarily due to substantially higher fuel costs compared to  which were partially offset by our improved loaded revenue per mile 
the improvement in the operating ratio in from was mainly attributable to reduced labor and purchased transportation expense as a percent of revenue as a result of improved driver productivity  as well as lower fuel prices 
logistics year revenue income from operations operating ratio the following provides an understanding of the factors that impacted our operating results revenue from our cross dock operations increased  in  primarily through growth at existing distribution centers 
revenue from our dedicated carriage and warehouse operations decreased  in due in large part to our customer  the fleming companies  bankruptcy in april revenue from our reverse logistics services decreased  resulting from the loss of a major customer in early these revenue decreases were partially offset by  in revenue from the domestic ocean freight forwarding operations that we acquired in late from seko worldwide 
a bad debt write off of  was recorded in as a result of the fleming companies bankruptcy 
revenue in our cross dock business increased by  in  primarily through growth at existing distribution centers along with full year revenue from distribution centers that opened late in reverse logistics services revenue decreased  in most of this revenue decline came from the loss of significant volumes from a major customer that  while declining in  were non existent in in  there was a  charge related to employee costs from combining certain administrative functions within the segment

included a restructuring charge as a result of staff reductions of employees to streamline the it organization 
corporate office expense non it increased in primarily due to retirement costs of approximately  for a former ceo 
amortization of intangible assets increased by  in  which resulted from the acquisitions of system express  inc and plymouth rock transportation corporation 
in it expense increased due to our significant investment in it initiatives  which resulted in the need for additions to our employee staff as well as the utilization of outsourced labor and consultants 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by  in as a result of adopting sfas no 
 which required us to cease amortization of goodwill in non operating income and expense interest expense principally includes interest on our guaranteed unsecured notes of  we had cash invested in interest bearing instruments during all of and for and  interest income also included and  from the settlement of tax related matters 
at the end of and  we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for was compared with in and in the current year effective tax rate is lower than that of the prior year because a net tax benefit was not recognized for the asia exit costs in the prior year  resulting in an increase in the rate for that year 
outlook unknown trends or uncertainties we expect improvement in our operating results in as a result of an improved economy and our strategic initiatives 
we believe our initiatives will provide increased revenue opportunities and generate cost savings through operational efficiencies 
we believe achieving improved operating results are dependent on us executing our strategic initiatives  the level of competition  and the extent of the improvement in the us economy

we believe that projected cash flows from operating activities and funding from our committed credit facilities will be adequate to finance our anticipated cash needs for sources and uses of cash operations our primary sources and uses of cash result from the realization of trade accounts receivable and settlement of payroll  trade accounts payable  and operating accruals  including insurance and claims 
during the three years ended december   the aging of our receivables remained substantially constant and our cash operating expenses ie  operating expenses less depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue were   and  respectively 
we maintain an appropriate level of tractors and trailers to ensure the effectiveness of our operations 
purchases of tractors and trailers have been  and are expected to be  our most significant type of capital expenditure 
these purchases can be deferred or accelerated in order for us to respond to changes in economic conditions and the market for these assets 
purchases of tractors and trailers and total capital expenditures were    and   and  during   and  respectively

there have not been  and we do not expect  any material changes to the underlying drivers of our operating cash flows

at december   we had no borrowings under these facilities and had  of outstanding standby letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
our external debt financing arrangements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements found later in this form k 
debt instruments  guarantees  and related covenants our financing arrangements include covenants that require us to comply with certain financial ratios including net worth and funded debt to adjusted cash flows 
we are in compliance with these covenants and do not believe these covenants would restrict us from securing additional financing  if necessary

there were no shares repurchased in and at december   we had authorization to purchase an additional  shares 
table of share price by quarter first second third fourth year market price per share critical accounting estimates revenue recognition at the beginning of  we changed our method of accounting for revenue and expense recognition for our ltl and tl segments 
under the new accounting method  we recognize revenue for our ltl and tl operations by the allocation of revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred 
in and  revenue for our ltl and tl operations was recognized when freight was picked up from the customer 
this change was made to more precisely reflect revenue earned  and expenses incurred  as of our reporting dates in response to the increase in our length of haul of freight  which resulted from the implementation of our new marketing strategies 
the estimation of a shipment s relative transit time at the end of a period is accomplished utilizing the estimated percentage of completion of each shipment based on its location status as provided by our freight management systems 
this estimation technique reasonably approximates the in transit times of shipments 
although there are inherent limitations in the methodology and estimation utilized under this accounting method  the amount of revenue recognized that relates to shipments in transit at the end of a given quarterly period has been less than of total revenue for that quarter 
accordingly  we believe that our revenue recognition method provides an accurate measurement of our quarterly and annual revenue 

table of contents thousands of dollars  except share and per share amounts insurance and claims casualty claim reserves represent management s estimates of liability for property damage  public liability and workers compensation 
we have processes in place to capture claims on a timely basis and we manage these claims with the assistance of a third party administrator along with our insurers 
our reserves for claims are significant and can involve a high degree of judgment 
we therefore utilize various historical data and trends to compute estimated reserve ranges 
these ranges  along with other known facts on individually significant outstanding claims  are utilized to best estimate our liability 
we continuously monitor our reserves and their underlying estimation methodologies 
we believe that our processes and methodologies sufficiently minimize the possibility of the final resolution of claims being materially different than our recorded reserves and our estimates have historically been reasonably accurate 
however  our estimated reserves are inherently sensitive to differences between our actual future settlement of liability and our estimation methodologies utilized in the preparation of the current financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we follow credit and collection procedures to ensure the customer credit risk is assessed and follow up is performed on delinquent accounts 
with the diversity of needs for our service offerings  particularly in the ltl segment  we serve a wide range of customers 
our procedures therefore must be flexible and consider the cost and benefit of providing services to customers to whom there is a higher risk of uncollectible accounts 
there can be significant write offs that occur which are not predictable  such as customer bankruptcies 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is computed by applying factors based on historical write off activity to our outstanding balances 
we believe that our credit and collection procedures  fairly predictable write off results  and the estimation methodology utilized to compute our allowance for doubtful accounts  minimize the possibility of our actual bad debts being materially different than the amount recorded in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  our allowance is inherently sensitive to differences between the actual future realization of outstanding customer accounts receivable balances and amounts as computed under our estimation methodology  which is utilized in the preparation of the current financial statements 
goodwill at the beginning of  under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
the test involves the application of estimation techniques to determine fair values 
the test that we utilize compares the present value of our expected future cash flows to the carrying value of our reporting units 
the expected future cash flows are determined from our budgetary process 
we believe that our budgetary process  which includes various assumptions concerning future operating activities but at the same time a sufficient level of objectivity and scrutiny  provides us with a reasonable estimate of projected future cash flows 
however  our actual results will ultimately determine the valuation of goodwill

recent accounting pronouncements on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees issued

 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the interpretation also incorporates  without change  the provisions of interpretation 
table of contents thousands of dollars  except share and per share amounts no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which it supersedes 
the interpretation does identify several situations where the recognition of a liability at inception for a guarantor s obligation is not required 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosures are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 

this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings  if any  under our line of credit that has variable interest rates tied to the libor rate and our investments in short term interest bearing instruments 
we had no borrowings under the credit agreement in or in addition  we had  of unsecured notes with an fixed annual interest rate and  of unsecured notes with a fixed annual interest rate at december  because these notes have a relatively long maturity feature  any sudden change in market interest rates would not affect our operating results or cash flows to any significant degree

our guaranteed notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsecured senior basis  by all our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
we are a holding company and during the periods presented substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary guarantors  and substantially all of our operations were conducted by the subsidiary guarantors 
accordingly  the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings and equity of the subsidiary guarantors were substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings and equity shown in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that separate financial statements of our subsidiary guarantors  and other disclosures relating to them  are not
